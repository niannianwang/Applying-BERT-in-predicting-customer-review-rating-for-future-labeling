1,1,"Why does it look like someone spit on my food
I had a normal transaction  everyone was chill and polite but now i dont want to eat this Im trying not to think about what this milky whiteclear substance is all over my food i d sure am not coming back"
13230,1,The do not offer free refills on your drinks its hot and it would be nice to get a refill I spent almost 70 bucks and they would not refill my damn drink
24392,1,Terrible service waited forever for our food Wont be back
7067,1,Probably one of the worst experiences I have had with McDs 8 to 10 food alarms going off the whole time The manager was outside smoking leaving the staff to drown The girl behind the counter spent more time apologizing to the same people over and over rather then work Took about 20 mins to get two dollar menu cheeseburgers Experience left a bad taste in my mouth Probably wont give a second chance even
7068,1,I paid 1 hotcakes and 1 hash brown by drive through behind me couple cars lined up and I waited 5 min to pick my food last time same order they missed hash brown so i was about to check the items but behind people waiting so I moved my car near by signal I checked hash brown missing again this time I want them to know so I turn and reach same drive through I explained one of the women staff came and ask my bag and she inspect I was not feel good at this point later she ask a male staff and discussing something and looking me like Im lying Bullshit who train the business ethics and code of cundect what the 
7069,1,Disgusting  And they legit took forever to release my order My mcchicken was made wrong and they had to re make it All in all it took about 10 minutes for 3 items of the value menu never coming here again 
7070,1,I waited a whole hour just for chicken nuggets after i ordered and i didnt even get the sauce for the nuggets then i had to pay with cash and no one wore gloves or a facial mask
24393,1,OMGThe WORST McDonalds I have EVER been in Orders were on the board and they were just standing around like the had nothing to do Drive thru was closed so everyone had to come inside to place their order This was my first and last time I will NEVER eat at this location No sense of urgency from the manager on duty as well
28046,1,"Just went and got 4 McChicken 1 Large French fry a medium one and a cheeseburger

The entire order was old French fries were saggy like and old lady titis The McChicken tastes like they were cooked a month ago Aaaah wait no coke because the machine was down First is the shake machine and now the coke Come on man Worst MCDONALD Ever fuuuuck"
28045,1,"I have been staying at the Holiday Inn next door to the McDonalds for four days now Every morning we walk over to McDonalds to get bacon egg and cheese biscuits and hash browns EVERY SINGLE MORNING that weve went over there we have gotten hard rubbery cold biscuits Their hash browns are hard as well and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up

I called the manager and she was very polite and replaced my breakfast with better biscuits However the replacement biscuits were undercooked They were very doughy I do not recommend this place to anyone The convenience to the hotel is not worth the terrible food"
7075,1,"I go here a couple of times a day if they are on a roll of making good tasting unsweetened ice tea Ocassionally I get a snack They have on their menu pricing for pies 69 each or 2 for 100 When I read pies I think it is all their pies Nope Their specialty pies are more and when you call them out on it they are rude and dont care Like the customer is supposed to be able to mind read pies means only apple pie It was annoying to be treated so rudely over cold mcd pies If you leadership is so unhappy maybe they should go somewhere that is a happier place We all have choices

There is some good leadership at this store and bad There is no in between Take your chances I mainly go there for the teawhen its good"
7076,1,Twice in 6 months I thought I would get ice cream through the drive through Both times they had no ice cream or yogurt No sign stick in long drive through to pick up nothing not coming back again
13224,1,Me and my dog went to McDonalds today I could see that they are overcrowded because the food is not that good I was very disappointed and to know that theyre overworked breaks my heart cuz theyre not feeding the people the way they should and theyre not preparing the food properly
24396,1,McDonald
7080,1,very bad but very bad at night the workers close everything and its 24 hours the other day ask what time they close and he said the supervisor never closes its 24 hours surprise he told me he didnt know why they closed until I saw that the manager  One day I get to work and that day they did not close what a coincidence hahahaha very bad these guys put yellow cones at the entrance of the car service woouuuu that bad and that is everyday woouuuu that bad
24398,1,Waited almost 30 minutes to get my food while people with bigger orders that came after me got their food When asked what was taking so long they said they are working on the order then followed by asking me what my order was After wards had another employee who knew what was going on come out to ask me again what order was had to stand there and watch them put my food into a microwave The worst experience ever
24389,1,Open 24 hours but not before 6am
7062,1,Went through the drive through and failed to check my order before getting on the road Twice before I have been given the wrong order How do they do that Third times a charm I am pledging not to go to McDs again
7061,1,2 people working 1 learning how to work and two cleaning instead of helping the line of drive thru cars and 8 people waiting inside to place their order Took a half hour to get two cheese burgers two fries and two drinks at 1030 at night And that was only half of what we ordered so we left
24387,1,Ill start with the positive The food I received was the correct order and it was hot The bad What was supposed to be a 10 minute trip ended up being almost 40 because they were severely understaffed and constantly giving out the wrong food to everyone Maybe theyre better during the day but definitely stay away from the midnight shift if youre looking to get in and out
13247,1,Not too happy with customer service they take sweet time to get you order
13244,1,Very bad bad bad I ordered two kids chess burger when I received my order I seated down when my daugher she oped her kids meal she told me her chess burger bite in half
13243,1,This McDonalds SUCKS BIG TIME THEY CAN BITE ME
24382,1,I am here in Orlando on vacation and I ordered via Uber eats and when I got my order the happy meal had no fries My large fries were half empty cold and soggy My deluxe chicken sandwich was cold as well I ordered a large sprite with it and it was flat and didnt taste right Tha
13240,1,Have no intentions on downloading your app but you wont allow me to order online and pick it up a double fail
7048,1,They removed tellers add kiosk which slows down the service 10 minutes to get a Mcflurry and two cookies Mcflurry is small is tiny cookies are as well Kitchen floor was dirty Kitchen crew was understaffed It wont be sad to see McDonalds decline I wont be going back to any of them Rarely ever do wont be hard to put a nail in the coffin
7049,1,There is something about the drink here  One time I ordered Ice Tea and it tasted weird  I let go of that one time  And yesterday I ordered the combo with Coke  I ate and drank  the next moment I had like an diarrhea like symptom  The coke tasted weird too  I never had a problem like this when I ordered from other Mcdonald  Last time the Ice Tea tasted bad so I tossed it away  I only took a sipped thats why I didnt get a diarrhea like symptoms  But this time I was so thirsty so I consumed half of the drink
28041,1,Seems like the more one goes to this locationthe worse it getstoasting an English muffin should not be a difficult task it wouldnt be badbut lying about toasting it Shame on themapparently after a certain hour it isnot a priority to make decent food for the publicor decent friesnot to mention a double cheeseburger simply gross Good griefthis place is certainly disappearing from my list of quick stopsto keep going by  cause Checkers is right down the road
24383,1,Sometimes high tech doesnt mean faster Location has multiple self service kiosk meaning instead of taking orders one at a time you have several being made simultaneously Causing a backup waiting to get food inside while competing with drivethru Location still does not offer dining inside after ordering food They had just mopped with 20 customers inside so that was a safety hazard Not to mention I overheard someone tell one of the employees that something was broke in the ladies restroom causing water on the floor
7052,1,"Horrible Manager here came for coffee and she started giving me and my family an attitude about 200  rude
she had blonde dyed hair and wore glasses older than 50 years old disgrace"
13238,1,Very bad service Do not give receipt Do not want to refill my soda Bad management I will avoid this place Shame that Mc Donald corporation let this happen
7054,1,Just about to finish up my big Mac there at McDonalds and what  do I find the biggest hair Ive ever seen I know it wasn
24384,1,Service at this place is a joke Sat in the drive threw for 20 minutes waiting of my food The tea is bad 60 percent of the time I believe this falls directly on management As there are always new employees there Most times having poor attitudes Also I have never once been suggested a pie I dont even bother pointing it out as it would only take longer And probably be un edible I only stop in there maybe once a month when Im in a bind
7056,1,Drive thru was blocked at 1230pm Had to make a 3 point turn to get out Not sure why block it when there are cars placed orders and waiting Location is a nightmare since under renovation Parking lot is taken by reno vehicles Nearby has awkward design
7057,1,Very disappointed in McDonalds in todays world To me McDonalds has really gone downhill is service is the pits Any employees most of all can use a lot more training I know I used to be the head manager at 556 East El Camino McDonalds and Im appalled of what it turn into I know when I was head manager there we always have a store I can just imagine what it is today
7058,1,ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with cheese  no pickles came in some aluminum bag all soggy nasty nsaty nsaty  never again going there should have gotten 0 stars
7051,1,Placed our order through the drive thru  Instead of getting a quarter pounder with my number 2 meal  I received 2 plain mcgriddles We get home and order isnt right  Tried to call and was unable to get through  Not willing to go back out in the rain  This has happened 2 other times at this
7083,1,This is the closest McDonalds to me and I go in the am to get coffee and they always have to park me for one coffee and it takes them forever to bring it out to me they are very slow workers and the managers are rude and don
13219,1,Would have given a 5 but the young black guy asked for my receipt for both orders after I reached for my bag but he never asked anyone else for their receipt and yes I was paying close attention
7086,1,They spending millions to renovate all their stores to stay pertinatewhile selling smaller portions of their fattining foods and raising their prices to pay for making the place look modernanybody else notice that McDonalds has gotten way more expensivetaken alot of stuff away from what used to be the dollar menuand took away alot of the all day breakfast
13206,1,I ordered a chicken buttermilk combo Didnt get a drink And when i tried to explain to the manager what happened she wouldnt let me speak Unsatisfactory
13205,1,Restaurant dirty trash overflowing and as always at McDonalds you have to demand condiments bad experience
7111,1, Fraud location  Fraud location  the manager told us they have different policy for this location they dont work any more with the corporate  I am really worried about Whats This now  they said they only respect the online ordering coupons if ur ordering at drive thru  in photo  the manager given us  health department must check this location carefully bcoz something is fishy here  or Macdonald corporate MUST HAVE A CHECK On them URGENTLY avoid it
28032,1,If I could rate a 0 I would I didnt even get my order because I had to wait so long What fast food experience EVER
13204,1,Definitely not a great place to eat no refills they charged for it employees wearing air pods  hats to the back restrooms dirty no trying to clean it Just horrible restaurant
24407,1,Took over a hour for my order and they need a PC system to let people know their orders are ready THEY NEED MORE HELP

24409,1,Just had the worst experience at this location Sidel who apparently is one of the managers and is Hispanic like me was extremely rude when we ordered our food through the drivethru She even was making faces at us 
13196,1,"Asked for refund and the cashier faked the transaction I asked if it completed and she said yes I did not get the refund

The sandwich was disrespectful "
28028,1,Food was decent until I found a tooth pick in my fries  unfortunately there wasnt anything I can do or say since I was just passing through on vacation from Chicago
24413,1,One of the worse McDonalds I have ever been to  There is no welcomes or thank you  Service treats you like you are a problem for them ie the server placed the food on front of the customer and started to walk off the customer said what about my drink  The server rolled her eyes walked away brought the drink back reached through the screen put the drink down and walked away  No I am sorry no have a nice day  For me it took over 7 minutes to just get a milkshake  Never Again for me
7122,1,Waited 15 mins in the Reserved for Drive thru spot for my very simple order and they missed two of the items that Ive ordered and paid Speechless
24415,1,Worst customer service Dont even bother to go  We waited 45 min for someone to take our order thru the drive tru Horrible and then the l
28026,1,Credit card processing down it happens But let me know instead of telling me  after 45 min in line Sharpie paper and some tape 
28025,1,If you like to sit in the pick up line for 20 minutes and when you finally get your food it is not at all what you ordered then this is the place for you
28030,1,Spent 15 minutes in the drivethru  most of which was sitting at the window waiting for my food Didnt get a straw my double cheeseburger had no cheese and my sons happy meal had no toy All I ordered was a a double cheese meal and a happy meal and you couldnt get either one right even after a 15 minute wait Completely unacceptable
24379,1,Took over half an hour to received food and it was stone cold staff looked demoralise when asked a member of staff about my food she just looked at me and walked away would never go there again spent over 90 dollars for poor service and food
7107,1,Worst service ever Waited over 40 minutes in drive thru Only to get cold food Never will i go there again Horrible service I would have given 0 stars if I could
7105,1,The food that McDonalds is not food in my opinion and no one should eat fast food of any kind Now that is my opinion But the breakfast sandwiches are great especially with egg
13217,1,I WAS JUST CASUALLY EATING MY MCNUGGETS AND I LOOK IN THE CORNER AND THIS GUY IS PLAYING HIS PLAYSTATION ON A MONITOR AND THE BOOTH AND THEN I GET UP TO GO PEE AND I COME BACK AND THE JANITOR THREW AWAY THE REST OF MY MCNUGGETS AND ALL OF MY FRIES SO THEN I ORDERED A DIPPED CONE AND IT TOTALLY MELTED ALL OVER ME INSTANTLY
7089,1,went there on new years eve around 2 am crowded very much and the queue was not moving for the next 30 minutes they did not had enough staff left with hunger stomach They should have atleast informed us that there is going to be a waiting time  4 ppl before us and the queue never moved for 30 minutes was surprising
7090,1,Ordered a number 15 chicken nugget meal for 650 They somehow didnt get the fries part and only thought I ordered nuggets and drink wtf even though I had made it very clear that I ordered the meal Then they tried to charge me an ADDITIONAL 1 for the fries which would have put the total cost OVER the actual price of the meal I wasnt having any of that bullsht and I guess they realized how ridiculous they were being because they relented pretty quickly and handed over the fries
28038,1,Absolutely the worst service They cant figure out the mobile app orders when asked how to fix issues with long wait times the ride staff just says what do you want me to do If you like people being rude to you and very slow service this is your place to not eat
7092,1,It was great the view was from where i sat was the  entrance door From where she sat was the soda machine In the middle was the order line We sat at a table that was designed for people in the order line waiting to order  to look back some look straifht on and see you eating Why So they can get humgrier They already hungry Its probably because if your a kid eating a happy meal and they have toy there gonna want one too so you tell your parents you want one too Or I whatever there eating they want to eat too because they are too lazy to look at the menu Thats too much work So the put a table for people to view where are eating It menu ideas and advertisement
7093,1,They had everyone wait in an extremely long line at the drive thru just to tell us it was cash only Which should absolutely not be a thing at a McDonalds We then had to continue waiting in line since there was no way out
7094,1,Pathetic customer service never attends customer queries over phone It says its open24 hours but in multiple occasions cancelled the orders placed via delivery apps citing that the restaurant is not accepting orders
24405,1,Prices are way too high got pulled forward only to wait an extra 20 minutes Still no food Went inside to ask for a refund Food still wasnt ready Ask what the hell was going on and the cow behind the counter said oh our bun toaster is broken  Didnt say that at the window This is an I DRIVE location Absolutely ridiculous Stay away What a waste
24400,1,Visited 3 times over a week during a conference This place is a shambles The selfordering system seems good until you realize that everything after is shambolic Twice out of those 3 times its taken more than 30 minutes to get a simple order and its not even been busy The staff especially the manager Martha is aggressive and disengaged Overall a truly terrible fast food location
7097,1,I went to use the restroom here and the toilet was all full of  so I told the manager about it They sent a guy to clean it and I kid you not after he was done he did not wash his hands I would not be surprised if this McDonalds will get an EColi outbreak
28037,1,Absolutely Terrible Food  No OPTIONS for Anything even remotely Healthy  The staff is polite  but McDonalds You WILL continue to lose business  People are finally looking at All the disgusting ingredients thats in the production of your food Even the yogurt has MORE SUGAR THAN A SUNDAY  I wouldnt even recommend the fries  Unless you want a Heart attack  with  a side of High blood pressure and Diabetes with a POSSIBLY of cancer then okay go for it 
24401,1,I dont expect 5 star service when I visit a McDonalds  but I also dont want an employee full of attitude handling
28036,1,The staff here is not friendly at all Where I grew up you greet somebody or at least say something The drinks tasted horrible
13209,1,very bad experience the employee are super rude they have very bad attitude
7103,1,slowest mcdonalds Ive been Waited for 30 min Think they are short in staff or either the staff is sleeping
7104,1,Every time I come to this one they are closed I even ordered something through the app and they still turned me away Need to change hours online from 24hrs to closed from 34AM
7096,1,"Be a Careful with this Store
He charged me 139  tax for a coffee I remained him about McDonalds coffee price 109tax But he said no  I back to my car took more money then paid Store no 4324 receipt 300 date feb2216 mon 2025"
28024,1,Got the order wrong Went back They told me to pull up 2nd window  They forgot me Then got the order wrong again
7041,1,The staff was rude and needs training on their people skills There was no good morning greeting and when asking about menu options it was like talking to a brick wall The service was also very slow even though it was not busy
13250,1,It practically says its open 247 but I just went right now at 425 am and its not open I called and asked what time they open and the lady that answered was really rude Now I dont have nothing to eat for my lunch Yall need to change what hours are you open because its really confusing and annoying going to your store and its not even open
6977,1,This one McDonalds I find charging 2 for a large coffee everywhere else it is 1 for any size drink and the reason I go to McDonalds at all is because of the coffee but if theyre going to double the price of the coffee then I may as well go to any 7Eleven so I have to save this one particular McDonalds would not lower the price when I told him that it was 1 everywhere else Arguing with a customer is not a good idea it would have been a better idea if she would have said Im going to let it go this time but no they actually try to argue the point and I think thats silly the whole reason that I come there at all is because of the 1 coffee that is fairly good on a one to 10 scale I would say McDonalds coffee is it seven or eight with Starbucks being a 10 especially when they suggest you get the expresso shot that is 425 for the large coffee with the extra espresso shot from Starbucks and then theres creamer but that for dollar coffee is four times better than McDonalds one dollar coffee so you get what you pay for I just think McDonalds at that particular Stevens Creek location bites off customers
13288,1,Wen you buy 20 peace chiken naget or more aniway you can have only 4 souce  that not cool carl
6979,1,Pulled up at 4am Waited 15 min in drive thru
13287,1,Awful awful Awful  bad service never going backGirl calling out the numbers was wispering them on purpose so customer wouldnt hear for tbeir orders
6981,1,Do not ever go to this McDonalds One of the most dysfunctional places Ive ever seen
6982,1,apparently if you ask for 2 cups of water here they will charge you for the 2nd cup 
6983,1,2nd time ordering a filet o fish meal in this store and it just tastes so bland the fries were cold and hard Regret spending  my money here
6985,1,Lobby is always closed whan its says is open 24 hrs
6986,1,If I could I would give an absolute thumbs down to this embarrassing branch of a wellloved fast food franchise NEVER will I return to it after being treated like a pariah I was yelled at by the cashier who took the wrong order and the branch manager threw a box of fries in the bag mumbling as if I was a beggar In her condescending tone the latter even warned me that she was doing me favor even though they made a mistake with my order and I did pay full price for it I think they both need more trainings to acquire the best of American customer service
28064,1,If I could give it NO STARS I would  We waited MORE then 20 mins inside for our breakfast  Ok I can see if you are that busy  need to make the foodafter 30 minutes we got cold food  the hashbrowns were so dripping in grease and colddisgusting
24351,1,McDonalds just needs to SHUTDOWN  Every McDonalds in the Orlando areanone EVER open on time systems are ALWAYS down CASH ONLY in the early morning hours IF you can find one that is ACTUALLY OPEN  Sign on door states open at 500amand at 605am still closed
6989,1,Not good the drive thru they cannot manage who go first on the drive thru And they talking like a frog they cannot hear even you shout And when your to get the serve look around not doing his job properly

13281,1,Got my order wrong rude and disrespectful Worst McDonalds Ive bee to
6992,1,Not 24 hours Exposed Change your hours
6976,1,Customer service needs work at this location I came in during my lunch time to get a simple McChicken and fries and a drink Stood at the register for about 10 to 12 mins waiting for one of the many employees walking pass me to deliver the orders outside Once they finally notice me they took my order After I waited around another 15 more mins to get my order I was gonna ask for BBQ sauce but decided I didnt wanna wait an extra 5 mins for that Overall this restaurant only prioritize the drivethru and not the dinein area Dinein area has no cashier available because everyone is focus on drivethru So many workers on the front but none on cashier If your coming here for lunch hour order online or else your lunch hour might turn into only 20 min lunch with all the waiting youll be doing here
6975,1,It claims to be 24 hours but when I stop by at 300 and 4 in the morning its closed the cashier always tells me its closed
6974,1,Why is show online lite a time open I pay many time then I came here it
13289,1,"Way too many homeless hang our here makes the place and area seem dangerous and dirty
Restrooms were not so clean "
24341,1,If I could give 0 stars I would We got turned away at the drive thru because they stated we are short staffed and really busy we cant take any more orders for 20 minutes and when I asked if I could wait in the drive thru they told me no because the drive thru is timed and it would time out I understand being short staffed and running behind on orders thats understandable but telling people youre not taking orders for the next 20 minutes I mean come on I am not sure who is managing this location but turning away business Seems like a poor business practice to me This happened on 1017 at 1030 by the way
6957,1,Worst service Ive ever had told em I couldnt pay at the screen where they have u order and I showed em my receipt and told me to wait cause he seem clueless on what to do didnt ask for help just stood there and told me my order will be ready and walked away and obviously Ik I still have to pay and ten minutes pass than 15min pass than Im like are u guys making my food and some lady like u didnt pay Im like obviously Tht what I told the last guy and she told me my food wasnEwanna get him in trouble
28072,1,This is quite possibly one of the worst mcdonalds I have ever been to Multiple times we have ordered mobile and whenever there is an issue the manager on duty blames us He even felt the need to come out to my car and berate me over it
24342,1,McDonalds is already a horrible franchise with horrendous service but this location is SO bad that I wanted to write this review to advise NOBODY to come to this location The service is a joke The food always comes out wrong The staff is not fr
6960,1,"Burger patties were served to us rare through the drive through Both mine and my husbands I broke mine in half to show the picture

28071,1,The girl who takes the payments is SO RUDE If you hate your job look for something else or at least treat people nice
13296,1,Horrible customer service and they will get your order wrong more often than not Still horrible customer service 2 mths later
13275,1,Skip this McDonalds Never received any terrible service unlike this one Better off eating street food or dumpster diving
24348,1,This place is terrible  They have no inside seating  which I guess happens  But the manager on duty this morning when asked about the seating simply waved my wife off and shooed her away without even taking her cell phone from her ear   shameful  we just wanted to have a quick bite before getting on the road on the tail of the tropical storm  The one bright light was the very sweet and friendly young lady that took our order   Wish I knew both names so that I call them out both good for the young lady and BAD for the manager lady on duty
28069,1,1st night in Orlando in vacation Drive thru was packed so we went inside Waited for 10 minutes and manager said lobby was now closed and we had to leave
24350,1,"Incredibly slow service sat in the drivethru for at least 10 minutes without the line moving When I finally got my food the crispy chicken sandwich tasted stale the texture was very chewy and not crisp at all on top of that I wasnt asked if I wanted any ketchup or sauces the sandwich didnt have a drop of mayonnaise or anything on it just oddly dry pickles and a soggy bun I had to park and go inside to get condiments As has become almost expected with the McDonalds experience the soda tasted like sanitizer Never again at this location
I only stop at McDonalds if I am blindingly hungry on the verge of passing out and still my past 3 experiences at three locations around Orlando have been disgusting

Update Got food poisoning and this is the last thing I ate"
28068,1,Morons running the restaurant The 6 meal is a rip off We asked if we could get the same deal but sub a side salad They said yes then they over charged us and yold us oh no substitutions Watch your tickets and repeat your order three times so the cashier and shift supervisor understand what you actually want
6969,1,I have just bought two BigMacs the first one contained no patties at all
6970,1,Horrible Its cool that this McDonalds is a 24hr restaurant BUT its almost midnight with only one other customer and here I am still waiting over 20 minutes now How slow can they be I can see 4 workers in here but that still dont explain this wait These workers sense of urgency is not there at all Not even moving with any purpose Maybe that is JUST the night So I hope
6971,1,Manager was rude We asked simple questions about prices and deals and responded with no empathy
6972,1,Waited in the dinein area for about 15 mins for someone to take my order workers pass by me and saw me and didnt even acknowledge me Managers also pass by me and didnt even bother to ask if I was helped Restaurant has ordering machines but there not working so you have to wait for any of the many workers there to acknowledge your existence at the restaurant to make a purchase Will not be returning to this restaurant ever rather take my money else where
13293,1,I order a large combo and they gave me less price than what I pay for and the lady didnt give me my receipt or ketchup or honeymustard very rude people never going there again
24357,1,"Unbelievably SLOW I ordered 2 cheese burgers and 1 frappe They took almost 30 minutes to get our food When they finally came to give us food the employee gave us the wrong food and had the BIGGEST attitude when I said the order was wrong DONT COME HERE IF YOU WANT FAST FOOD ITS MORE LIKE SLOW FOOD Dont recommend horrible will not return again
Another thing is put cheese burgers were cold and dry The frappes weren"
6995,1,Service was great but the chicken inside sandwiches were really not well I had bad stomach for almost 3 days
6996,1,Service is lousy and I tried to call number to complain to manager and no one answersno voicemail
24373,1,Beagle was old and hash browns cold
28056,1,I went through the drivethru at this location and ordered a big Mac a large fry two McDoubles as well as a medium caramel frappe however when I return to my room the big Mac was missing as well as the cookies so I drove back up to the location Ive now been sitting here over 20 minutes and nobody has come outside to let me know what was going on I would highly recommend finding another McDonalds to go to seeing as they dont seem to care about their customers
24374,1,They made me wait in the drive thru parking lot line and still forgot my order that says add cheese This has happened twice yet they still give me the bag with the add cheese stamp on it with false advertising that it is has cheese I am paying for extra cheese and not getting it on my food its ridiculous and stealing honestly This is the third time this has happened Will be calling c
7024,1,Terrible customer service Employees doesnt even smile or initiate the greeting Very long drive through up to 30 minutes with just only 1 lane open If I am a manager I will never tolerate this long wait time Drive through is suppose to be for the convenient and time saving but this service is just completely defeat the purpose

7029,1,"I dont like giving low reviews without eating somewhere but at midnight seeing the sign on the window saying open 24 hours we pulled into the parking lot The lights were dimmed and the drive through was blocked with cones After leaving the freeway and going out of our way to stop here they were closed and the sign held a false advertisement Chances are we may not get the chance to visit when they are actually open so heed my warning THIS PLACE IS NOT 24 HOURS

Edit After visiting that night we tried again a little before midnight and the drive thru was still closed and blocked and the sign still said open 24 hours"
7031,1,There is a horribly rude worker here  I asked to order something and she just gave rude and sarcastic responses the entire time  I confronted her about it at the window and she didnt seem to care  Talked to the manager  He said he would handle it  Im sure he wont so I contacted corporate and gave my report  Dont eat here  They do not care about customer service
7032,1,Slow service No Ice at Breakfast  Coffee tasted like cleaning solution was not rinsed out  Hilariously a McDonalds employee was walking around the corner with a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on a plate to eat for their own breakfast Why no US flag
7033,1,Shity customer service incompetent cashier took over 15 mins to place a single mans dinner order it was only a big Mac fries and a drink  Parking lot was full extremely small for the volume of customers Drive thru line was super long and extremely slow  After I finally got to the window after I paid I had to wait there for 10mins just to be told to pull around and park  Had to wait another 1520mins to get my order
7034,1,Not rated one star for this McDonalds they actually happen to be a solid and enthusiastic group of people always willing to ensure your happiness and satisfaction I just think McDonalds sucks in general That being said the staff at this specific restaurant is quite friendly and approachable and Ive never had a bad experience with the food or anything Theyre usually quick and the food tends to be accurately prepared In a world where this distinction mattered Id actually call this a really good McDonalds but the significant other is bummed about their removal of garlic fries and the ice cream machine is hellof broken all the time Anyway Bring vegan items to McDonalds
28052,1,I guess when youre in a tourist area you dont have to worry about pleasing your local customers for return business Stale burger buns cold and burnt french fries  Medium fries box was about 23 full  Drive thru employee didnt say two words to me beyond the price of my meal
7036,1,Food was cold and hamburger was not cooked all the way Ruined my lunch
7037,1,I was there at 437 am and was informed that i must wait until t for there 2 for 4 deal I went back thru the drive through 2 more times once at 445 and once at 454 and was informed again that i had to wait until 5 exactly Then when i finally got to order thwy also screwed me on a hash brown They werent polite about anything and made me feel very unwelcomed
24377,1,Very rude employee taking orders slammed the window in my face and left and  didnt charge me also called the manager and the manager was worst than the employee beware of this location this people are rude and very far from being polite horrible experience staffsocks
7040,1,I park into the parking lot I see 2 vans full of homeless peoples junk I walked in the MacDonalds bathroom one of the stalls was full of poop Later I got my food  Was in my car ready to leave then I smelled poop   on my hands The entrance door had poop from the persons hand But on the bright side they gave me an extra meal for free But the cleaning service was not good
7018,1,Night shift crew here is very iffy Guy in front of me gets served I get told the place is closed and then the guy behind gets served Honestly dont bother with this place Big waste of time

13271,1,Too many homeless people Also this dinning area is quite filthy
7002,1,Given too many chances Ive tried to be polite no matter how rude the staff Tonight I gave 1 more chance My order was taken down wrong so I confirmed at the second window before taking the food The woman was very upset she had to remake it made it clear with snatching and attitude told me to pull over and when i got my order it was wrong AGAIN Also took items  and was charged for adding lettuce
28059,1,Quarter pound CB although made correctly with no onions was raw in the middle not noticed until my husband was already almost done eating then he just threw it away hopefully he does not get sick Kids meal CB ordered with no onions not rang up that way was covered in onions Lessons here cook outs not being done to make sure on quality  not serving raw product  cashier needs a little more trainingbecause when I ordered my CB kids meal with no onions  a Large diet cook as the drink He did not put on there the no onions  then asked me what did I want to drink
7017,1,"Super sloooow The shake machine is always broken Early in the morning the service is almost impossible Takes forever just to take an order and takes forever to process the order Ordering ahead with the app saves no time And if youre lucky the coffee machine will be working
Youre better off going somewhere else I will never do business with this McDonalds again  EVER"
7004,1,Worse McDonalds Ive been to I have decided to go a mile further to the Augustine Dr one instead at this point Constantly slow missing items or not making them correctly Ordered for curbside at 8pm was told restaurant was closed and I need to contact corporate for a refund
28058,1,The worst McDonalds Ive been to Went in around 10 maybe 11 at night after visiting disney on the way back to our hotel Went inside because the drive through line had at least 10 cars no big deal I was ordering a carryout Anyways they forgot the chicken nuggets for the 10 piece chicken nugget meal I wasnt about to bring my two little ones back out so I called the store I told them what had happend and said I would be back sometime tomorrow afternoon and to just get it then my boys love McDonalds she said that would be fine and she would be there the next day I asked her name but it couldnt really understand what she said because she was talking fast Anyways I go back the day and told the lady at the drive through what happend she didnt know what to do and had to get a manager the manager comes on and asks who I spoke to and I told her I didnt remember but she said to bring my receipt in and she would take care of it Manager didnt believe me I ended up just buying another one and I know its literally only a few dollars but it was the principal
13268,1,Too many homeless ppl hkt my order wrong workers acted rude
24368,1,We waited for 50 minutes in the drive through The line moved at the beginning but then stopped completely near the order box Because of the way the cars are channeled through a curbed path we couldnt escape We were trapped and had no choice but to sit and wait It was very frustrating The order we received was correct but we didnt get any apology or explanation Well Mark this location on the map and never go here again
24369,1,"Thank you for the cold breakfast Made me wait almost 40 minutes Families got theirs before my lil sandwich and coffee They just forgot about my meal and let it sit Only thing warm was the coffeebarely
Not anyone"
24370,1,More than 40 minutes waiting for some cheeseburger and fries and when I approach one of the senior employees she reply with an   attitude Definitely never stopping on this again
24371,1,Rainy first night in Orlando we went here after a super long day at Disney World We waited over 20 min for our food in the drive thru None of our order was correct and it was pouring rain so I did not want to go back through the slow drive thru I mean McDonalds is what it is but people go there for quick and convenient and those components were def missing on this particular visit 
24372,1,I waited 20 minutes until I got my food but the order was completely wrong I ordered two double cheeseburgers and I got one with two patties and a glob of ketchup on it The other just had a party with two dry pieces of bread on it The fries were colder than a dead body in a freezer What an absolute joke of a kitchen staff Just a bunch of high school dropouts that cant even make a sandwhich correctly If your reading this just go buy some burgers and bread and make one yourself
24362,1,Literally the worst McDonalds Ive ever been to
7128,1,Wanted to go thru the drive thru But it was closed Had to go inside very crowded And slow First i went to the other mcds Up the street on lakeside Went inside and they said were closed caused of understaffed All these mcds R getting very awful on service
7129,1,"I waited in the curbside parking for 15 minsno one delivered the orderi had to go to drive thru stand beyond 10 cars and had to pick up the order

Very pathetic customer service

I will never visit again"
24416,1,To whom it may concern Your curb at the entrance of Hawian Bvld at International Drive is dangerous to cars turning right to park The curb extends to far out to the drive and is blind to drivers in SUVs are high sitting vehicles I can tell by the damage to the curb that Im not the first to experience this and damaged was caused As a suggestion you may want to paint the curb bright red or install a Yellow caution post to alert drivers The right think to do would be to correct it
27955,1,I placed an order about an hour ago only to find out that half of my order was missing I called this location to let them know that I was missing half my order The manager Judith stated that if I dont come before 4am them Id have to wait until the next day to receive my order Although I do understand that their menu items are schedule based I think its highly unprofessional to turn their problem into mine I understand that my items were not available after that time but she was extremely unhelpful in finding a solution to the problem they created I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager is on vacation The call ended with her stating that she does not have time to deal with my problem because they are too busy
27954,1,This was the worst McDonalds Ive been in We ordered using the kiosk and  they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your food We waited 20 minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husbands drink He went to the counter to get it and they didnt believe him at first My coffee had the label on it for what Id ordered but it didnt have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and  the coffee was tepid I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonalds for a while The staff didnt seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonalds website and we left
27953,1,I placed my order at 733pm tonight and got the order at about 815pm  I had to call to make sure they received my order Apparently they either forgot or overlooked it  Usually they would throw in a free item to make you happy   not this place
7244,1,wait for an hour in drive through path And cash only finally I waste one hour here
7245,1,"Drive though 
1 One meal was missing burger
2 bad potato in one of the fry
3 Slow delivery compare to other mcdonals"
7246,1,Probably the worst run mcdonalds Ive been to in a long time Workers are sloppy and food comes out crazy slow
7247,1,Only because of the lack of training is why only did one  So much n
13118,1,I got a raw meat burger It was cooked outside of it But inside under the part was cooked was very raw meat That was unfit to eat And made me sick I dont prefer NO body to go eat their at all they will Kill you with uncooked meat in your burgers
24461,1,The worst McDonalds in the area I have lived close to this McDonalds for a little over a year now and have yet ever had a good experience My order is either not accurate or the food is unacceptable Also the team members and management just dont seem  to care Im not usually one to complain about things because I do realize this is a fast food restaurant however this last visit has really ticked me off I couldnt even place my order because the person taking orders in the drive thru was so incompetent and then she wanted to act like she couldnt hear me Other times I have visited this location  I have had an issue where items were left off my order so brought the food back to have it all replaced because by the time I got home and had to drive back to pick up my missing items it would all be cold I asked for my order to be remade and I legit watched this manager put my sandwich in the microwave  I could understand if I had a huge order to be replaced but it was honestly 3 items With that said I will not be back to this McDonalds location ever
7250,1,Dont go there Theres a European guy whos very mean to customers and hes the worst human being Ive ever met
13114,1,Go anywhere else Not here Beyond the counter this place is never clean  Glorified truck stop  Too many other options next door and nearby that are more deserving of your business Especially since the dining room is no longer open 24 hours  No drive through Sad Literally steps from the pier The collective grime of all of Santa Monica resides on this location surrounding sidewalks The homeless arent the issue  It is the mentally disturbed  the hustlers  and questionable addicts This is not a family friendly location  Wisely most families recognize this and steer clear  These truths sometimes slip pass the trained smiles of the cashiers and you see the weariness and defeat  No other business has these issues  Not one  Food  No problems
27950,1,Im sorry to give only one star But during our visit were in the childrens area 7 of 7 tables or seats are not clean It was uncomfortable for me to sit there There were many spots to see unappetizing if the area for the guests looks like how is it in the kitchen I do not want to imagine it I will not go there a second time
7253,1,mf wasted my time saying open 247 bt they are closed
27949,1,Service was terrible wouldnt allowed to use the app couldnt redeem point wouldnt let us use gift card I think they were pocketing the cash they overcharged us and forgot Burger
24466,1,Forgot to put the sign we are closed
27956,1,"I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonalds to in the past
This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly At that time it was worth it The menu was cheap or at least what you know to expect from a international chain and since its a chain you know what the food is gong to be like
So lets look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants You need to set yourself apart with your service This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant Sadly I dont think they care anymore The last time we went half of the kiosks werent working One of the three that was didnt print receipts This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious Actually there was a lot that played into it Now if youve gone to McDonalds at all recently you know you pick your food at the kiosk get a number that you take to your table pay at the kiosk sit down and wait for your food Typically all of that takes about five minutes Well this day and what Ive garnered from tourists and locals on many other days the team at work decided they werent going to bring the food to the table That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE but of course that would have been a form of service so that didnt happen After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together only a slight exaggeration we were told by other customers that were leaving that they werent calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters
Ok So I go up to the counter and wait We get our food 40 minutes later and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected No big deal we are used to this
My inlaws are visiting and at this point Im trying to figure why they havent received their order It dawned on me  that my father inlaw doesnt have a receipt remember the machine that wasnt printing receipts
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt not the tent number Apparently my inlaws food was ready in a master of minutes amazing since that is all customized and placed in the abandoned order area If we hadnt said anything they would never have received their food The lady never once called a tent number We told another person of the lack of receipt problem That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt she asked us what the receipt number was We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine and she asked again for the receipt
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump Im not sure if they just didnt staff well on this shift but like I said Ive talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while"
27957,1,Hands down the worst McDonalds Ive ever experienced Rudest employees Lady in drivethru looked like a manager and was infuriatingly rude and just a horrible person The young girl at the register refused to acknowledge me turned her head and walked right by as I tried to ask for help Other people ordered ate and finished there food while I stood there unacknowledged for over 10 minutes waiting for 2 double cheeseburgers and a fry A guy was just leaning on the counter doing nothing and walked away when I said I could not wait any longer Never got my money back a
27959,1,"Really slow service took over 15 minutes to receive the food  after it had been delivered to another table

When it did arrive the chicken and burger were cold Duly sent back to be fair they were remade and brought pretty quick but no apology"
7235,1,Service was awful didnt understand my order
13132,1,Worst McDonalds ever  Customer service is non existant They act like theyre doing you a favor by letting you order food in their establishment Then it took 20 minutes to get a simple order Heard MANY complaints while we waited All McDonalds are worse since the kiosks came in but this location is a disaster  Avoid 
7219,1,Always old tasting fries and hard buns I dont expect McDonalds to be anything super but this is noticeably disgusting
7221,1,Sketchy late at night Cash only and no receipts
7222,1,There is no lunch today very bad
27968,1,Busy under staffed slow service condiment stand a mess out of lids ketchup dispenser broken  I ordered to eat in and my food was delivered to my table in a to go bag  Why take a number and have an associate bring a to go bag to the table  Very  very illrun and poorly  managed location  Just  awful
24455,1,"Please calibrate The Sodas Machine correctly

He has been mixing and preparing sodas wrong for days"
7225,1,I went to this place and asked for an ice cream and he is like we dont have ice cream
24467,1,Severely understaffed for such a busy location Ive seen McDonalds with more workers in locations in the middle of nowhere Expect to wait at least an hour for food and make sure to check your order before leaving as I and at least half of the patrons I saw leaving came back missing something
27967,1,Slowest McDonalds I have ever been to in my life Took an hour just to order in drive thru Then took another 20 minutes just to get our food orders 2 burgers apple pie and 20pc nugget so shouldnt have taken to long at all
13129,1,"No drink refills
Bad service "
13127,1,If I could do 0 stars I would There is no place to lock a bike so I had to take it in with me The security guard tried to get me to leave because I have a bike Im not leaving a 3000 bike at the door with all these homeless people around who will steal anything Then they refused to take my order because I wouldnt lea
7230,1,Took half an hour to just get 4 piece tenders employees standing and joking around with each other
24456,1,"This location is incredible It has two stories Has automated machines to order from You can get a variety of different items to try out that arent at regular McDonalds Its always super busy here too so expect a wait

Im a local and I decided to try something different when a friend was visiting so we came here and ordered pizza I was so sick for the next three days that I couldnt leave bed Never again"
24457,1,Paid for nuggets by time I walked all the way to my apartment approximately 25 minutes and we started to eat we opened up the food no nuggets
13123,1,Had been driving for several hours and needed to use the restroom before ordering But employee was refusing to open the locked bathroom before I ordered Extremely rude At least it was clean and food was ok
27960,1,Take the extra 5 minutes to go to a different location My entire order was incorrect and stuffed into one bag which broke 2 seconds after it was handed to me The person who took my order was more interested in rushing me then looking to see if it was correct Went inside to speak with a manger and turns out she was the one who bagged my order I then got screamed at by some young wanna be Rico suave who shouldve been in the kitche
27966,1,Ridiculous i am not one to ridicule this is pure ridiculousness I should not have to check behind people that are begging for higher wages and they cant even get a kids meal right you forgot the nuggets and I also ordered fries and apples I received  double fries  no nuggets as well as missing the sauces that were to accompany the nuggets I tried calling when I arrived back No one answered the phone Here is your negative review that couldve been rectified with you answering the phone to address these issues
7259,1,Rubish fires 2 mins after they were cold and tasted like soap for some reason
27945,1,Worst MCdonalds experience ever 40 minutes and counting and no order Dont ever stop here unless you want to get extremely mad
24468,1,Took more than 30 minutes in drive thru with 5 cars ahead of me Not only the slowest McDonalds ever but by far the slowest McDonalds I have ever been to
13092,1,"Worst McDonalds in the world thats a big statement but its the only one that fits
I ordered breakfast on a Saturday It wasnt too busy but when I got my food I was missing some sandwiches my pancakes were super cold like if they had just defrosted them and put them in my bag and the hashbrowns were literally stuck to the wrapper and the bag they came in looked like it had been dunked in the deep frier

Save your money go eat somewhere else where the food is actually edible
To clarify Im not bagging on all McDonalds I quite like the food BUT this location is terrible my suggestion is to go elsewhere"
27927,1,Food was cold Cheese wasnt melted on burger Is that all is that all is that all is that all after every item u order I will tell thats all when Im done ordering Wow customer service is really bad everywhere these days
7289,1,hated it we had to wait for food and then when we got home and looked at our food my bigmac that i order with no lettuce had no cheese instead of no lettuce
7290,1,Could not find our order came out 6 times
13089,1,No dollar menu anything but drinks here Even coffee is 2 bucks The service is spotty and confusing at best The place is small and serves the end of the busiest street that leads to the pierultra poor planning on space for quality of servicebusiness There are a lot kf vagrants at this location but they are for the most part harmless
27923,1,They were very rude and food was cold They refuse to let us inside and made us wait 10 mins for three sandwiches and when it was time to get the food two people were VERY RUDE Next time Im in town Ill never go to this McDonalds They were slow rude and not friendly
24476,1,If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight The employee manager handling the front end was the rudest individual Ive ever met of all my visits to McDonalds in my 30 years Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food One lady said shed been waiting on her food for over an hour They wouldnt even accommodate her with a refund Infact my order 25 took 40 min to fill The store shut down the kiosks as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby I understand its easy to get overwhelmed but when youre filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour your prioritizing methods are failing And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers Im on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again But if I were a local they would have just received their last 25 from my pocket My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonalds in down town orlando the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty McDonalds Id fix this ladies attitude or Id find her replacement
27929,1,Very bad so gross  didnt do clean up 
7294,1,Got food poisoning from breakfast Rude service inside the dining room
7296,1,If you eat here more than 80 of the time your food will be wrong or cold
27919,1,The people in this place could not get any more Dumber Made it a point to order by the number on the menu board and they still are able to screw that up Super great place to visit if your intention is to go through the drivethru then have to park and go inside and fix your order each time
7298,1,Fast food  when there is nothing else open late night
13087,1,if youre a tourist DONT go to McDonalds especially this one rude service poor choice worst fast food chain in US by far
24478,1,I have no idea how the employees got hired They are so rude and have no manners They literally see you standing there for over 10 minutes waiting and no one offers to helpThey all need to stay home if they don
27916,1,Hey we just left this place Had a big order  lots of people hungry after getting to town late Among other things we ordered 3 orders of 20 nuggets 4 large fries a bunch of dbl cheeseburgers and a quarter pounder Know what we got A drink we didnt order an apple pie we didnt order an ice cream we didnt order and one 10 piece nugget In a big bag that looked enough like one that would hold our order  our bad I guess but our not checking closely enough just doesnt excuse just not getting 40  worth of food And then they dont answer when we try to call Absolutely terrible store
7303,1,I cant remember the last time i had fresh french fries
7295,1,Ive been coming to this McDonalds for so long And its always dirty Tables are all dirty
7217,1,Drive through again didnt get the Sausage Egg McMuffin Right Third or fourth time Probably should go inside
24475,1,This is the worst run McDonalds I have EVER seen in my life the service is super slow Its complete chaos The manager should be immediately terminated along with the rest of the useless staff I would rate it zero but that wasnt an option
13095,1,Got my order wrong took forever to serve my sweet tea Crispy chicken had a large piece of not so crispy chicken w the foulest tasting sauce Ill never order again  watered down sodas so much youd think it was club soda Never again
13105,1,"This was an ok McDonalds but I liked going to this place because it was so busy during the summer so you are more likely to get hot and fresh food Now that its December 2020 they are slacking I guess they are having more problems with the homeless or druggies or drug dealers outside of their business but twice in the last two weeks I got cold and halfcooked fries after 9pm

Maybe because Im a gang stalking victim this is happening  REPORT ANY AND ALL COMPLAINTS TO CORPORATE

On December 13th 2020 I got the free double cheeseburger it was a cold burger a"
24469,1,Ordered 2 cheeseburgers with no pickles I got 2 burgers with no cheese and pickles The establishment itself was clean kept and had a nice interior update to it The soda machine is a touch screen and you can add flavor shots to it if youd like So if you like Russian Roulette this might be the McDonalds for you
27943,1,Service was trash took them 20 minutes to take my order no exaggerations Seriously cant even salt fries for some reason and the employees werent able to organize correctly For example at one point there were three employees gathered around to fill one order ONE ORDER Seriously Id recommend going somewhere else then to spend your time and money here
27942,1,I had the worst experience at this location I went to the drive thru and only ordered 2 hamburgers and a small fry I paid and pulled up to get my food and was given the wrong order I let the associate know it wasnt correct He had me pull up to the wait window to get my correct food As I sat and waited time was just ticking by After 15 minutes of patiently waiting I wanted my food No one came back I knocked on the glass and no response As about the 10th car received there food at the window behind me I had to get out of the car and walk back to that window as it was late and the inside was closed I asked where my food was and he said he was making it I asked for a refund and was given my slip refund a total of 28 minutes after first paying I went back in the next day to speak with a manager to let them know that this happened I had my receipt with the time and the refund receipt with the time 28 minutes later He said oh Im sorry theyre new Terrible customer service and uncaring management
7266,1,Really slow services for late night Drive thur was so slow They wanted me to park for a soda I refused
7267,1,Workers were not friendly They picked and chose who to serve Some were told that the lobby was closed and some were served
27937,1,They never seems to get our order right  Thank God we always check our food and for some reason I always have to go inside and they get in an attitude So we will not be returning nor recommending to any of our friends or family
24474,1,Worlds worst McDonalds Went there on may 7th 2021 at approximately 11pm pizza was closed play are arcade closed  ordered food to eat in tables dirty asked several times to get it cleaned and to get better in had to stand on a line for 35 minutes to get my drink because they wouldnt bring it to the table what a joke Spanish manager was a witch to be nice I say nasty nasty and a joke to run it like this she had no care
7270,1,They keep messing up my order but what did u expect its McDonalds
24472,1,McDonalds International Drive had really terrible customer service Not sure whats hard about ice cream in a cup but they were determined to charge us for a sundae and could not have been less cooperative ChickfilA this is why I love you so much
13101,1,Worse Mac Donalds on the planet and the most discussing rudest staff  I
24473,1,If you prefer to talk to a person then DO NOT go to this location They only take orders made by kiosk in the dinning room
27934,1,Terrible customer serviceordered from the kiosk was the only person waiting at the counter and not one person acknowledged me To make matters worse the manager was assisting in fulfilling orders instead of delegating her employees While they stood and had conversation I waited 15 min before I received a Did you order Not even the management acknowledged mecant expect good service if the management doesnt know how to give it
7277,1,"Bathroom floor  all wet toilet leaking  constantly  also  no toilet paper

Also very dirty

District manager needs to see this place  "
13097,1,"This McDonalds is always very busy so I understand why their customer service isnt the best

Even so I still dont understand"
13096,1,We asked for a cup of water after we were done eating our food inside Lady said we needed to purchase until she seen my orange juice cup she then proceeded to give us a tiny cup What exactly were we supposed to do with that Meanwhile others got a decent sized cup for water What do you lose to give out a cup of WATER
7271,1,MacDonaldstill relies on fat and high glycemic carbs to make the food palatable
27971,1,Unnecessary long wait time in drive thru Drive thru is built for double cars and double pick up windows but still stayed behind 4 cars for 30 minutes Only waited due to long drive home with kids in the car Rude staff as well Really wish I had noticed the Burger King across the street earlier I would have even settled for checkers across the street and thats saying a lot because I dont think anyone willingly eats at checkers

24424,1,Sign on door says drive thru open 24hrs and there is signage under the McDonalds M by the street that says open 24hrs They are NOT 24hrs they open at 5 The lady working inside was annoyed that I was trying to get service at 445 and rolled her eyes when I pointed out incorrect details Need to fix their information
13176,1,Cashier had her hair in a ponytail and so did all the other workers thats not allowed  servsafe states you can only have youre hair in a braid or bun when working with food one of the cooks had on of the sides her shirt in a knot exposing her lower right stomach I asked the manager and he said the cashier had her hair down in a pony tail because she was almost leaving and the chick with the shirt up was because he shirt got in the way of her cleaning OH BTW she was cooking and sweeping with out washing hands 
24425,1,Absolutely the slowest service Ive ever had at a fast food restaurant  Me and my 3 friends went and we all used the kiosk to order our individual meals  After 45 minutes and having to talk with the manager we finally got our food  There was one person working fries one cook on manager assisting the cook and one employee who was supposed to be putting the orders together and delivering to the customers  The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on  He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the After seeing that 3 customers who ordered 20 minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que  So he had no idea what any of us ordered We had to give him a receipt and the he helped us 10 minutes later All the trash cans were over flowing into the floor and the restaurant was very dirty   All the employees including the manager didnt even look 18 years old They were definitely under trained mis managed and probably under staffed
24428,1,Theyre telling everyone in the drive they to come inside but they are making all 20 people waiting in line wait til they take and make a couple orders Been waiting at least 15 minutes theyve helped a total of 4 people Kiosks are all t

7162,1,Went in and the cashier didnt want to take my order she wanted me to do it for her when the restaurant was not busy at all this type of behavior is unexpected in the workforce
27993,1,"As usual the food prep people dont know how to read a order slip Big mac no sauce no cheese

28017,1,This location has slow service and horrible customer service  The computer order machine was not working  instead of informing custmers they said nothing Orders were backed up and the staff acted like nothing was wrong What kind of training is McDonalds giving their employees  For such a big business  and being involved in so many charities you think  they would emphasize excellent customer service McDonalds you are slipping

Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff I waited at the drive thru order kiosk then at the payment window and then at the pick up window Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait Her response was I just put on the headset Seriously that was her response There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service Why didnt she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness NOT LOVING IT

Visited again on 3172018 and had the same experience Even the white shirt manager ignored me"
27978,1,Worst customer service ever I was invited to come in after having to wait over 45 minutes on the drive thru Manager Priscilla calls me to apologize and invites me back with my family I explained I cannot come back next day but would come following Sunday she agreed and hung up On Sunday I come to the restaurant and there is another manager Cynthia who I explained the situation and she grunted the whole time she took the order While on the service line she tries to contact the manager and right there from behind the line she asks me yelling what is your name I tell her and again in front of EVERYONE other customers included yells again she tells me you came in already I replied NO at this point Im embarrassed and upset and I hear her that she tells the person on the phone I already put it down Twenty minutes later I finally get the order I ask her to change the fries on some of the things that were ready because they were cold The manager grunts and agrees to After my family were done with their meals we had ordered ice cream and we asked to hold off until we were done When we returned we asked for the ice cream and we had asked for chocolate they said that we had ordered vanilla and the manager gave us one less of what we ordered Incredible Bottom line we were invited to come back to make it up for bad service and McDonalds came through we got yelled at by the manager embarrased long wait for food missing food items and pissy attitude by staff Next time I get invited back I guess I gotta read the fine print or ask for what am I invited to come back for Sorry that we dont have negative stars because this location would take them all

27974,1,Extremely rude and impatient I asked for 3 water cups with my 40 meal and I got a glare and only one cup  Then my brother who ordered a 20 piece nugget went up to ask for sauce because they didnt include any that we asked for after waiting patiently and then asking several times he got 2 of the 4 he asked for  He came back frustrated with only 2 so I told him to go back for more He asked the manager 4 times to her face very nicely for 2 more and she just looked at him each time and went the other way Eventually a kind fellow customer next to him reached over the counter and just took sauce for my brother Not impressed
13137,1,Ordered a triple cheeseburger  when I opened up my burger it was single I go up  say its wrong and I get We dont have triple cheeseburgers Apparently putting 3 patties on a burger is prohibited but other locations are fine with me ordering this Will not be returning

27991,1,If it were possible to leave 0 stars I would Absolutely zero customer service The only interaction with both guys at the drive thru was when the order was placed neither of them spoke a word in person The guy at the payment window was too busy talking with the guy who would be the person to push the food out of the window and he couldnt be bothered to tell us which of the 2 pick up windows to stop at I would say that the behavior could have been excused if they were busy but they werent at all Yet even being busy doesnt excuse the gross lack of basic human interaction
24436,1,This place was a mess They took FOREVER to serve the few people they had A guy dropped a spatula I was freaking out They would take counter order cause the manager said When we are done in the back So upset with this service

28266,1,The wait is 30 minutes my nuggets where white in the center because they didnt separated them before putting in the fryer all McDonalds that I visited near my hotel on kisseme took 30 minutes
24265,1,McDonalds corporate you need to investigate this location immediately The customer service is highly lacking and Im positive the management of that location is damaging your brand Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited Zero response We spoke multiple times No reaponse No one greeted us No one asked us to wait Nothing Radio silence Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder Needless to say we drove away without making an order It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonalds
24266,1,We had a great dat at SeaWorld with the gkids and decided to swing by and get ice cream for them on the way home  Well we get there and there is a line out the door because only one of the 6 kiosks are open  We wait in line for 30min and as my wife gets to order they shut it down to only drive thru   Absolutely horrible customer service and the lack of care from the manager was disgusting and extremely disappointing  Never would I say this company is a favorite of mine but now I never plan to visit again

24285,1,Absolutely horrible place After waiting 40 minutes we had to ask how much longer The first lady looked at the orders then ignored me The manager finally came and couldnt even find my order The workers were just yelling over each other and at costumers Never got all our food and was upset with this place we just had to leave Will never go back and we frequently are in Orlando
28163,1,I was robbed  I was charged on my bank card and i was again charged cash   I paid twice  and got no refund  all I got back was a threat and an attitude  no cash back

28160,1,They forgot to put in the toy milk and plum sauce in our kids happy meal and forgot the salad dressing for our meal Never have I seen such a terrible Mc Donalds in my life I have been in them all over the  world with constant quality till now
24283,1,With the size of the big breakfast that would starve a child Maybe you should start calling it baby breakfast If you dont get cakes with it then you have over half a tray of just a bite of eggs two small strips of bacon and a dryhard biscuit I think a total of six bites and two minutes with phone in hand while eating and it was gone There goes almost ten bucks

28183,1,We waited 15 minutes for our food then when we recieved our food the fries were cold The fish sandwich tasted like it was microwaved and the new chicken sandwich tasted like rubber
24273,1,We walked over from the hotel that was in the same lot The door sign said the dining room was open to 3am We got in the dinning room at about 1030 when other costumers who were already inside walked out We were asked to leave as the dining room was

6784,1,They dont take directions well
24274,1,Its not actually a 24hour store Theyre open but if you go at night around 300 am and 400 am its going to be closed I think they switch for a dinner to breakfast but its unfair for people who work third shift like myself I can almost never get McDonalds Its funny cuz they also barricade all the doors and drive throughs
24275,1,Stop to get b fast they must have been in a rush cause when I went to eat my sandwich  the sandwich looked like it was dropped several times

24294,1,I really dont want to be that guy and I typically do not leave bad reviews But this experience this morning was absolutely HORRIBLE I waited 24 min for apple pies that I know for a fact do not take that long to cook Restaurant looked to be short staffed which I understand and there was an employee there that was fairly new it seemed which was also fine My issue came with the TWO managers that were taking care of the guests Zero communication to anyone about what the wait was about I deduced that I was waiting for pies because I heard the crew talking about it These 2 managers were more concerned about what they were doing later and how one typically doesnt work weekends Did not Apologize or attempt to communicate anything to any guests The worse part is as the food finally came up they tossed my bag to me and walked away I hop that this is not typically how business is done there but my goodness
24295,1,worst service i
24297,1,Massively understaffed 25 min wait for food Also got the order wrong Corporate needs to sack up and pay their people more because the world is on fire inflation is rampant and end times are near Also every fat miserable Disneygoing family youd never want to run into frequents this place Avoid at all costs

27550,1,"Number of times weve ordered from this McDonalds 3
Number of times theyve gotten the order right 0

It cannot be spelled out any clearer Quarter pounder Absolutely nothing on it No cheese Just the meat and the bun It is so simple Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it The stale burned bun breaks picture I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find theres another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well

I give up FightFor15 indeed"
7760,1,Terrible Ordered an artisan grilled chicken sandwich and this is what I got Old soggy lettuce So that tells me the person preparing the sandwich just didnt care or that this restaurant does not care about keeping fresh items in their kitchen 8 for this meal to get home just to throw out this sorry excuse for a sandwich And this was after I had to go BACK through the drive through a second time because my sons happy meal was missing the fries I mean isnt there a screen that shows what should go in the bags before handing to the customer And after the second time through I got home to that trash sandwich and they also forgot the sauce for the nuggets even through I saw it on my receipt so they knew I wanted it and hot cakes without butter Just carelessness on all fronts at this location Oh and when I got to the pickup window I told the woman I have a boy so please put a boy toy in the happy meal and she said all of our toys are unisex I will include a picture of his unisex toy Take the time and drive pass to the next McDonalds along your route

7830,1,Drive through was exceptionally speedy when I got waived off to park I had asked for a cup of water to still get waived off I get my meal and asked about my cup of water the staff member seemed to not car and walked away I walked in to ask for a water cup to have the rest of the staff say that if I wanted a water cup with a lid in a small cup I would have to be in drive through Where I came from It wasnt until a shift manager 3 associates later did they ok for me to have a child cup of water Water

27541,1,Terrible service through the drive by They threw out food into the bag and it isnt the first time I use to come here alot as a kid but growing up it got worse I hope their employees can have better customer service And dont throw food everywhere
7796,1,"Food health safety is not in the vocabulary of the staff at this location Every time I get food from here usually through someone else going to this location despite me telling them specifically NOT to go to this one I get stomach pains diarrhea and sometimes I even vomit the morning after Once called to complain and their response was just dont eat at this McDonalds What a joke this place should be shut down

Edit almost forgot to mention the one time they didnt even cook a patty all the way through Was still pink in the middle Like you have one job when youre grilling burgers"
27540,1,They are very rude and have no respect for people they yell at you like you did something wrong then the make you wait for your order then they get the order wrong and the best part nobody there speaks any English burger King for me
7798,1,McDonalds quality What can I say the quality taste and preparation have gone straight down the toilet Of the 3 taste is suffered the most there  fries used to be the best now theyre the worst  Its so bad I try to use McDonalds as a last resort      The last resort
7799,1,This McDonalds is soppesdly 24 hrs but always says they cant take orders around 3am  This is bs  And its constantly yet the one near waterford lakes has no issues taking orders There needs to be new management seriously
7812,1,This place makes it difficult to spend money here They cannot get a drive through order correct to save their lives they turn away cash money and they generally have rough customer service at best Save yourself the trouble go down the street to damn near anywhere else
7801,1,The most incompetent staff and management Ive ever experienced in a fast food restaurant Items missing in my order even after I asked if it was placed in the bag Rude staff very unprofessional laughing joking with other employees while on the headset taking my order Business number that appears online is disconnected so you cant reach any management Not even thru the survey online you can get anyone from corporate Definitely I rather microwave a dollar burrito than come back here
27538,1,Very bad service I dont recommend to go there 30 minutes waiting for a order and nobody say nothing
27536,1,"There was an excruciating 15 minute wait time for two simple breakfast sandwiches and the place was empty When checked the sandwiches were actually missing the cheese
While waiting some filthy guy was exchanging 80 in singles for twenties After he got done with his banking transaction he actually spun around and walked right into me talk about the bum rush
The true danger here though is when you try to enter There is a welcome sign at the curb directing cars to enter into a single lane driveway where the drivethru actually exits A headon collision waiting to happen
Stay far away from this place"
27535,1,They did not give me my complete order I made 3 order  of chicken deluxe and my order was missing fries whet back to made a complain and they were yelling at me and husband this is not fear to the customer People should be aware  of this  Mcdonald at Broadway and check their food properly before they leave drive thru Those staff there are thief
7806,1,Fast food with tast quality that is slowly diminished till it helps tast is terrible  I remember going McDonalds as a child the fries were the BEST now theyre the worst sloppy gooey mess I actually use McDonalds as an absolute totally worst and last case scenario
7807,1,Went at 11 pm after a night out with the kids The drive thru person that was taking my order was the MANAGER TATIANA she was rushing me throughout my whole order and even said OH MY GOD because she was getting aggravated The one person that has to set the example of customer service should be fired Ive never had a manager to any establishment talk to me in that way And to top everything off the nuggets to all my orders were so sheet and not crunchy like they sat on the warmer for hours because the employees were too lazy to fry up new ones This McDonalds has gone so downhill First it was the employees now its management They need a whole new crew
27534,1,They always mess up orders or give you the wrong order  Many times the orders or not like instructed Not too happy with this place
7809,1,Went on a ice cream run for my pregnant wife and I know you dont go to McDonalds for their outstanding customer service lol however this visit the staff was unbelievably rude It almost felt like a skit on what would you do

27607,1,Their food taste like plastic Very unsatisfied with them They used to be good But now its like they dont care if the food is fresh or not
27605,1,Arguably one of the most incompetent branches of McDonalds that Ive ever had the displeasure of going to I spent 20 minutes waiting on a mobile order when I could have easily gone through the drivethru and gotten it in 5 Absolutely ridiculous
24603,1,This has to be the WORST experience ever at a fast food place We used the kiosk and were thrilled because we placed the order faster than the workers that were ignoring us at the counter THEN they only brought 14 of our order Forgot our 4 McCafe drinks and condiments Then when one of the teenagers told someone at the counter he was told to ask someone else Really You want 15hr for this I had low expectations because no McDonalds gets the order right but damn
27604,1,For the third day I went to this McDonalds which I frequently always come to this McDonalds my daughter and my niece love McDonalds so each time I place my order I ask for a medium fries  with my additional order and for the three days that I went they were given me burnt fries  Im sorry but I paid a lot for my order to begin with Im not excepting burnt fries especially three days in a row Each time I asked for some new fries and then they would give me good fries that were not burnt Except for yesterday I got my money back  I ask the girl why was she giving me burnt fries and her reply was that they didnt change the oil in which they cooked the fries in The point is as a customer you dont have to keep excepting burnt fries or anything that doesnt look right to you You are already spending so much money to begin with to be getting burnt fries Lately theres been lots of issues with this McDonalds people have attitudes dont have manners they dont even say hi  or thank you for coming Ill be taking my service elsewhere No customer service
27603,1,Literally the worst McDonalds ever  Food always cold  Staff is all illegal and no help from them about asking about promotions always busy both inside and drive thru have plenty of workers but somehow always a long wait  Rude workers even if you call asking about promotions they always hang up  Even with all that said they still have the same stingy services with uber eats  Cold half cooked food go somewhere else save your money
24605,1,Make me wait over 25 min and still get my order wrong if you want to get upset go to this drive through

27608,1,Absolutely horrible Not sure who the owner is but they should definitely get a new staff and get Mcdonalds corporate to come in for training The service is bad and so is the food They give you what they want not what you pay for especially as it gets closer to closing time Food should be available and fresh no matter how close it is to closing Workers should understand that if they dont wanna work let somebody who wants to do the job Not suprised at the amount of negative reviews but I am suprised that ownership and management does not take these reviews into consideration Complete disgrace Go a little further in bellevi

27625,1,Disgusting place burgers always cold they will literally give you only 1 sauce even if you paid for more staff is LAZY always talking and joking constantly instead of taking orders or making orders they will leave you there waiting and having a full blown conversation instead of helping Literally the worst and grossest McDonalds I have ever been to doesnt even deserve 1 star
27624,1,Ive never had such a bad experience in any McDonald and this one because of the unprofessional employees I left without buying food just because I wanted to use the  restroom first The lady that seem to be the manager was so rude to me and all the customers looked uncomfortable

27616,1,Service at this McDonalds is horribleDont know how to greet customers nor answer with proper tones I come here because close to home and no matter if i go inside or drive thru takes long to take order as well as prepare them I asked are they not required to wear hairnets and was told NO Being that I work in the food service industry I know its required by state lawHowever 
24598,1,Very poor 22 minutes of waiting on my order to be wrong and it was sitting on the back counter the whole time Didnt say anything because I knew I hadnt ordered what was on the tray Employees only wanted to do one thing and passing the buck to someone else The kiosks dont work properly The line to get your money is quick enough but the wait is ridiculous Only 6 words of English amongst the whole crew Thand you I sorry Come again Wel here are 2 more for you Never Again
27615,1,Do not eat here People handling food are not wearing their masks properly which are meant to cover their nose mouth and or both Went the other day and two people handling food just had their masks hanging under their chin not covering nose or mouth Disgusting Air particles going right onto food What a shame Made a complaint online with McDonalds and they sent me an automated response not even address my complaint properly DO NOT EAT HERE for your own safety

27563,1,McDonalds is the worst food you can feed to your kids and for yourself the burger  bun so hard it Crack your teeth by the time you get to your car the food is cold  and McDonalds has the same menu from the 80s and 90s you better off cooking at home and with this inflation nobody has money 
27562,1,This place is not good at all the manager Had an attitude when I went with my mom and a few friends we ordered our milkshakes and fries and when my moms friend asked for barbecue sauce and ketchup she realized that she wanted ketchup and buffalo sauce so she asked the manager and the manager said and I quote  Which one is it Then my moms friend looked up and said buffalo and ketchup I guess
27561,1,OMG  Last time I order 3 double cheeseburger  they look like they were sitting there for hours So this time I ask the girl that I want my burgers fresh so they come up with the brilliant idea of putting the burgers and the fries in the microwave so they would be nice hot and fresh

12753,1,Very slow 20 min in the drive through and havent gotten my food yet

24639,1,This McDonalds location used to be great Since their renovation its been just a disaster Customer service is non existent managers and staff are all in the kitchen pushing food out No one at the front to help just disgraceful
24633,1,Bathroom it was a disgraceful experience Lobby tables dirty Drinking fountain super dirty Hamburger box came oily Unfortunately it was NOT a great experience and cleaning McDonalds Better to give up on McDonalds for once and for ALL You can base a restaurant by their bathrooms

7925,1,After waiting in the drivethru 2 minutes after saying good morning employees decided they felt like taking only cash and serving breakfast items Were one week away from 2017 invest in a credit card reader

7968,1,I never like McDonalds  I have eaten  there just never been impressed
7915,1,I understand that mistakes can be made but when the order is done on Uber and you have the receipt and time to complete the order how do you confuse a small Sprite for a tote of cookies
24632,1,Stopped in to get breakfast and there was mold on my bagel and the oil must havent been changed in a while because the hash browns tasted like old oil instead of hash browns Never will stop there again
12768,1,They are very very ghettothey take 4ever to do orders toono kind of customer serviceneed to have customer training servicetoo many youngstersorders are always a mess upneed to be aware of folks coming up to your car asking for changeservice is slow inside too

7857,1,"Is it Ghetto Yes
Was my order right No
Will I ever go back No
Will I recommend Hell no
The problem I had was that this McDonalds is in a not desirable area Theres homeless roaming the streets and panhandling right in front of the entry of McDonalds

If you want a clean safe and nice atmosphere go to a McDonalds in a ritzy area They do not tolerate these types of behaviors"
7858,1,The 1st window cashier was very rude she had a attitude I asked for the manager she act like she didnt care what went on in the store or cared to hear my complaint if someone has the correct number for

12793,1,This place is pathetic We tried to get a late night meal but apparently it stops at 12am As we tried to order some other drinks and they claim that the soda machine is down Epic fail
7863,1,The worst MCDONALDS Ive been to and Im from NYC The managers look like they dont shower and the food is always terrible Drive a few miles down john young and you will find better spots DONT BRING YOUR MONEY HERE HOPEFULLY THEY WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND MAKE ROOM FOR A GOOD RESTAURANT

7869,1,I ordered a snack size mcflurry and they gave me a regular mcflurry and charged me for the snack size Absolutely disgusting behavior from mcdonalds If I could give them negative stars I would

7837,1,Worst McDonalds experience ever  Do not visit this location It doesnt matter how many times you ask for a special request with your food they will still make it wrong and than lie to you when they give it to confirming your request was done when in fact it was wrong the whole time  They will not give you your complete order the first time you have to drive around and wait inline again or go inside to get your order correct and if you dont double check it at the counter they may get it wrong again I do not recommend this location to anyone 
7838,1,Waited 10 minutes in front of drive thru pick up window while 2 employees had their backs to me only to get cold soggy fries and a chicken sandwich that wasnt hot and tasted like it was cold leftovers    So yeah this experience was GARBAGE
7839,1,Orange juice add waterno taste n water flavor Water x extender juicechiring cheapernot respect x costumerthen  server say I dont knownot take responsibilitynot good
12800,1,For fast food it was slow and really not clean like trash
7841,1,Went at night And it was terrible These ladies take your order through drive thru and you wait and wait and wait 30 minutes on the drive through Call corporate on these ladies Horrible serviceNext time im hungry i will go somewhere else
7842,1,Horrible service manager Donnie did nothing to assist Only drive thru was being served and thats because of it being timed
27525,1,I only eat at this specific location when I dont have time to travel elsewhere The McDonalds at Newark Penn Station AND Broad  Market street got way better service than this one No one speaks English so there
7843,1,"Piss poor service Didnt bring drinks over with our order When we was asked for the cups got nothing but a snotty nosed look and the server walked away and never returned
Seemed to be the general attitude of all the staff involved including the senior on duty"
7845,1,If I could give zero stars I would there lazy to make guava pies I ordered 3 and they gave me 2 I paid for 3 Then they said its 12 mins to wait thats fi
7846,1,Terrible I thought they had great food at one point however Im thinking that Burger King is going to be better for me from now onthe simple fact I went yesterday at 300 in the morning to go get a burger and they gave it to me ice cold then I had to wait on the line like about six cars in front of me in order for them to get the sandwich right then they put very little bit of lettuce which I asked for extra lettuce I dont care if I have to pay for it I just want my extra lettuce and no pickle on the double McDouble anyways I dont know but I might eat them but not as much as I was eating them before and as for their fries well they were good
7847,1,The drive thru manager at night is extremely disrespectful Never going to this McDonald again She does not talk to you without yelling or offending you
7848,1,I was discriminated by a drive Thru today for me being hard of hearing  Employees at this McDonalds are always extremely rude They should be thankful in hard times like now they have jobs Went thru drive thru w my kids was placing my order and cashier told me she would not take my order cause I was not fast she also said things that were rude and inappropriate
12797,1,The worst customer service ever never get order right they get annoyed when you are trying to see what you want your push to make an order with having the time to decided awful
27527,1,"Every single time I order on Uber eats or DoorDash or even go to the Drive thru part of my order is missing I call to speak to the manager and all I get is attitude This is an issue as not always do these delivery apps refund you  Or to drive back isnt something you can always do

As someone who was manager at one of the top McDonald"
7851,1,We were in the DRIVE THROUGH  for 30 MINUTES  They messed up a simple happy meal order I went inside to speak to the manager and told him that the fries were ice cold and they never gave me the drink that comes with it  The manager never apologized he just looked at me and said ok He gave me the drink and new fries  The employee was the one that had to apologize for him because he didnt hear an apology from the manager either so after a pause of the manager just staring at me the employee said I apologize Unbelievable how the training for these managers are at this store
24623,1,Horrible service Whoever that moronic lady working the counter register at 1150 pm on August 15th 2018 is she should be shoved into a corner of the rear of the store indefinitely The fact that she couldnt grasp the English language isnt even the worst of if On top of that she had an attitude and acted like her doing her job was an inconvenience I get it it
27627,1,Hot ass mess 
12786,1,Lady at the drive thru made a mistake and we talked to her we were courteous and she mad dogged and had an attitude
7875,1,This is the most fickle drive through  Some days they are on point and its in and out  Days like today they have you pull forward to wait for your food Eleven minutes later you walk in to see what the hold up is and the bag of your food is sitting there on the counter Who knows how long it had been there for and how many minutes I wasted due to an incompetent employee who probably thinks they should be making 15 an hour
12772,1,Ordered a quarter pounder and got a fish fillet instead smh messed up my order
7898,1,The service here was very rude they are very nasty when it comes to customers like they dont want to work they only talk in spanish what about the ones that dont understand Thats not good service Needs new management
24631,1,Never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant which is a big deal for me to say since my 3 year old is allergic to many things  This morning around 1228 am 112418 when asked the very standard  may I see the food allergy menu or since that wasnt available would you mind checking the ingredients on the package while I wait to place my order while others go ahead the cashier was told by the manager right in front of me that she would not get the menu nor would she check the ingredients and went right back to laughing and carrying on with another employee  The same manager stood around looking at others needing help during the rush without any movement or intention to step in for her team or their long waiting customers  The entire place was in disarray from the back to the front with filthy tables floors and bathrooms  Every trash can in the place was overflowing and the pungent smells both in the lobby and the restrooms were enough to make anyone lose their appetite  Black Friday or not absolutely unacceptable brazen behavior from management that I would never tolerate under any circumstance from my own team at any level of the company  Zero starswould not recommend
7900,1,Got charged twice for a mobile order and even when I went to get my curbside order I ended waiting for 10 minutes and went to the side door and even got disrespect from the manager of the store Dont care how good their fries are this just made me quit on Macdonalds all together
7901,1,This place is always unorganized  Every time we Uber they send the order with missing food The staff is rude most of the time and to top it of they never pick up their phone  They need some serious training 
7902,1,Service was fast but the guy at the window Covered in tattoos was drinking and sucking on his fingers while handling peoples orders The only reason I grab my order was because someone else prepared it
7903,1,This place can never get a drive thru order right  Even told the manager 3 times that I wanted round eggs and not the folded ones  Everytime I do a drive thru ordered its messed up  Never again will I go there  They suck  Sorry  Corporate is in town and they will hear about this place
7896,1,Ordered the buttermilk crispy tenders and when approach the counter after I paid they said will not be available until dec 28 in exchange only offer a 6 pc chicken nuggets really a 6 pc nuggets Plus they took so long just to tell me that
27507,1,I walk into the store in Roanoke TX and the employee is sitting on the counter and leaning on the cups with his but touching them I wonder where else hes been sitting at maybe where the food is made
7906,1,Same thing applies for any McDonalds short staff food is expensive and not prepared properly it seems like they cannot get the order right
12770,1,Poor service Need new management and workers
7908,1,A few minutes ago I placed an order and they gave me the wrong one and when I complained they responded with an unpleasant and nasty attitude  The worst attention
12769,1,Slowest drive thru ever never will i come to this mofo take 30 mins for what
7910,1,The guy who took my order was rude and tried to tell me a small meal isnt a thing Not that long ago I worked at a mcdonalds A small fry and a small drink with my san
7911,1,Its unacceptable to have to wait in the drivethru for 40 minutes just to order food
7912,1,I ORDERED THE WHOLE MENU THEN I GOT FAT AFTER DONT RECOMMEND GOING HERE
7905,1,Never go to this McDonalds its the worst if u complain about something they complain back the staff is slow rude and unhigenic I saw three employees use the rest room and not wash there hands even the manager has an attitude
24625,1,No hand sanitizer Biscuit was dry and hard Staff wanted me to take a number to place on table but I refused No telling how many millions of ppl held that thing The germs Ugh
24630,1,Worst McDonalds experience  ever  Silent 25 mins in drive thru  When ordering we were advised could not sub drink in meal with McFlurry and had to purchase separately  When finally making to window to pay they couldnt find my order  For this to be in a Prime location in Orlando  they completely failed the meaning of fast food
7893,1,I ordered two combos on the uber eats my total was 30 dollars and when my food arrived two of the shakes I ordered where missing I called the mcdonalds and they never answered Be carful when you order so that your money does not go to waste
7876,1,Worst customer service manager actually rolled her eyes when I asked for a receipt and told me that its a giant pain in the ass yeah that actually happened their kiosk was allowing me to order food that they did not have and did not tell me this till I asked for the McRib and hes all we dont have that I just ordered and payed for itif I had not asked they would have never said anything about it Stay Away Unless you want to get rude service
27516,1,Flavorless grease bombs This chain in general has gone down hill in a big way
7878,1,How this company hired a manager who doesnt speak English Food was cold and nuggets were stale cold fries
7879,1,The 2 for give dollar deal was bad I ordered two quarter pounders and they were left over from the past definitely not fresh from frozen do worst burgers Ive had at any mc Donalds
7880,1,Would have been nice to get some warm food and to not have to listen to the workers screaming and arguing through the hole meal  Also could have lived wo all the foul language the workers were using  I will not be back
7881,1,"I ordered a bacon McGriddle with White American cheese They gave me Swiss I acknowledged them the issue they said they only have white American cheese and no other white cheese They are currently advertising the mushroom and Swiss burger thats a white cheese too I thought

Or is the Swiss the only American cheese Or does anyone not know the difference

I need a manager At least ask me if I want my food replaced with regular cheese

So the McGriddle eventually was eaten "
7882,1,App sucks dont work because the restaurant does not show order Employees and management does not care and act like they dont speak English Unprofessional
24628,1,Terrible service I order a few things and had to wait over 20 minutes in order to receive my items No one approached me and another guy when we were standing at the cashier for over 10 minutes Not even the managers I had to ask one of the employees if they actually had a cashier
7883,1,Poor guess service no one greeted or even said anything at the drive thru even tho they r drive thru only
27514,1,Horrible customer service Manager is a very unhappy person who obviously does not want to be there
12781,1,They need to learn how to treat people better talk to people better hire better team members and managers
7887,1,Order two large fries both was burnt  Not the frist time  They will give nasty food when going threw the drive threw 
24626,1,It was really bad the chicken wasnt good didnt salt fries forgot the sauce and when I ask for it he gave it to the person next to me
7889,1,I am tired of the inconsistency of this particular establishment The first thing is that this is the only McDonalds in the area that starts serving breakfast at 3 am It is next to a club and i am sure a burger sounds better after drinking but anyway back to the inconsistency I show up everyday at 245 am and sometimes i can get a qtr pounder and other days they say its not on the late night menu What really bugs me is that several time I am told breakfast only No ody shows up at that time for a mcgriddle Stop being lazy and make the food Most of the breakfast is ready to slap together and is why they do it but i show up before 3 am and I want a burger Why cant the staff get their stuff together as i wrote this review 3 people drove off because they did not want breakfast either
7891,1,I ordered a burger and salad and they took 25 minutes to bring me my food My entire lunch break was spent in the waiting area of the parking lot and looked like they didnt give me extra chicken on my salad as I paid for Very disappointed
12777,1,Waited for 25 minutes for a cup of coffee after telling the manager about my order she didnt know about and she was taking orders bad customer service dont stop here
12782,1,It wsas a bad service for a breakfast just waiting for 10minutes in line to order
27912,1,It is unfortunate what I experienced in that place A man entered in his wheelchair just to charge his chair battery to continue on his way  and the manager of that store took him out of the place it was inhumane what she did with that poor person
27628,1,Never coming back here again Associates not wearing mask handling food only 5 people at a time no sign that says only 5 people at a time insideif I can give 0 stars I would
12863,1,poor service missed a sandwich no cream or sugar for coffee
24528,1,"Id like to start off by saying so far I love the employees they have great attitudes they act professional and real kind

So I stop by almost every morning and have come to realize their apples pies are often hard as a rock This is becoming to be a real problem at this location They also dont put the  best by  stickers on them  I"
27827,1,My husband and I wanted to do a combo through the mobile order but the drink machine was shut down The Manager Keith went out of his way to be rude and shut us down with a No cant do it when we asked for a orange juice for the price of the soft drink scene the soft drinks were not available because soft machine was broke As we stood waiting for our food he was being very condescending and also maid comments like he can
24531,1,If I could give this less than 1 star I absolutely would I spent 30 minutes in line just to get 2 meals and 2 ice creams for my kids Waited 15 minutes just to pay and another 15 to get our food Will NEVER recommend this location to anyone The sad part I didnt have high expectations because it was late on a Saturday night and all of the theme parks were letting out and even my low expectations were shattered
24532,1,Warning avoid this location at all costsTruly one of the worst McDonalds in the nation Theres always an issue in the drivethrough theres always an issue when you go inside the store The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the 3 ruled is Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonalds conference in Orlando Florida If I could give them negative stars I would When you go through the drivethrough there is not a proper greeting It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order There is no quality service Its all about quantity instead of quality
27826,1,Took 20 minutes to order then they messed up are order charged us for there mess up Questioned the price they gave us a hard time just to get the receipt to prove them wrong That took  another 10 minutes
7428,1,Its not open 24 hours
27824,1,"Be Aware

Always a problem in this branch Either order is wrong or missing key ingredients in burgers like ketchup for example or stale meat ingredients or the high prices or the 45 60 minutes long lines etc What broke the camel back for me was when some customers would skip the drive thru line and when speaking to the McDonalds manager I was told theres nothing they can do about it Very bad area to be in for sure Ghetto employees and ghetto customers Better to drive couple more miles either way on 192 than to come here"
27821,1,"Most unprofessional and rude mcdonalds I have ever been to
I recently went to this Mcdonalds and order 2 quarter pounders with cheese with no ketchup or tomatoes because I have an allergy and a large coke When I got to work Im happy that I checked it before I bite into it because it had both When I called them and spoke to the manager I was asked my name and to come back and they would replace it I couldnt make it back that day because I was at work so I called the next day and left them know my name and I was going to go by and get the replacement and they said that I was ok to pick it up Not even 5 minutes later the manager called me back and told me that I couldnt go pick it back up When I said the manager said it was OK the person that called me back said it was a different manager that I talked to and thistles manager said absolutely not Which it was the same manager Like how unprofessional and rude this mcdonalds was"
24533,1,Employees I dealt with were rude When they got our order wrong they tried to blame it on us not ordering right We showed them the receipt and still refused to admit they were wrong The girl went to the back and came back with the right order didnt say anything or make eye contact just handed me the bag This is the rudest I have ever been treated at any establishment fast food or not I recommend everyone drive a little farther up the road to the next McDonalds than deal with what I had to deal with
27820,1,Couldnt even order I was greeted at the drive thru with were only taking one order at a time there are 2 people in front of you Ill get to you when I can so I thought maybe they were severely understaffed After 20 minutes at the speaker waiting I pulled off without ever being spoken to again to find at least 6 or 7 staff members kind of just hanging out inside surely not moving the drive thru line along
27819,1,I have worked at a McDonalds and I have never seen such disrespect Lack of communication and unprofessional from a manger in my life I had a Uber eats order and called 15 minutes before to make sure that it was able to be picked up and when they answered the phone I asked my question and I got hung up on not once but three times When I arrived and have waited in the line the man taking the orders in the drive through said our Uber order would be ready at the second window When we got there the manger told us no orders for Uber were available When I asked if he could double check he said that we would have to go back in line and that he was busy I understand if there is system issues but I 
27817,1,Waited 34 minutes to pick up our order and of course it was wrong and cold Poorly managed I do not recommend this location
24534,1,Absolutely one of the worst experiences ever at McDonalds Ordered a ice coffee and cappuccino at 1013 pmwaited and waiteddrive through backed up 2030 people inside waiting absolute chaos Finally at 1047pm the lady asked what I ordered and made them so I could leave Literally 35 minutes for coffee Horrible experience short staffed and totally out of control

27847,1,The food is no good for you since I have found out since the last time I reviewed this that there is pork in their hamburger I will not be going there anymore I should sue them as what I should do I havent ate pork in 20 years very disappointing and you would think a big establishment like this could get turkey bacon or turkey sausage
24521,1,What a waste of time we were there in line for more than 30 minutes The woman at the window asked for our receipt and still did not get the order correct We spent 5 minutes at pick up trying to get it corrected  When I asked for my re eipt back she told me she lost it When I said I wanted the Manager she slammed the window shut The manager  said she put the order together from the receipt He stated the order screen only holds orders for 25 minutes Not sure what to think McDonalds at this location in the later evening I would suggest do not stop find another
27846,1,My family and I came here and we were all disappointed They were not welcoming and they had a line didnt even bother asking anyone what they needed The people needed to stop the worker and ask for what they needed no one was ever at the counter We are Hispanic and we also felt discriminated against because the lady at the counter didnt want to give us refills and didn
13002,1,Rude staff asked the manager about the birthday grimace promotion and she said I dont know and walked away
24522,1,Horrible service stood there for 20 minutes trying to pay 600 for my food Manager was talking to one customer ignoring others workers were in back play fighting Drive through line was around the building and over 12 customers in line After 20 minutes asked if I could pay manager when she finally came by  register she told me I would have to wait very rudley and walked away She was very ride to customer in front of me also who had waited longer for his food Will never go back there and advise others to avoid this mcdonalds
27809,1,A Big Dog was unleashed in the restaurant Seriously I love animals but I have some allergy reactions

24525,1,Waited 40 minutes in the drive thru and then they started turning cars away Wouldve loved to go somewhere else but the options were sparse at 1 AM Got up to the window and the manager literally didnt even care about the horrible service
27833,1,Raw meat Dont go here second time happened to me
27832,1,Not greeted when entering employees refused to acknowledge us while we waited to order just to be told by another guest that we have to use the kiosk An employee walking to the bathroom confirmed this Kiosk doesnt accept cash and touch screen was not responsive Decided to go to drivethru and waited a few minutes just to pull off and go to chickfila where they still know how to serve its customers
27831,1,"We have visited this McDonalds twice now using the drive through It took forever both times  the car in front only ordering 1 or 2 items First time it took around 10 minutes to order and then we had to wait for the food another 10 minutes

7418,1,Unorganized get it together Mc Ds
24524,1,How hard is it to give us the unsweetened tea we ordered instead of sweet tea We got on the hwy took the first sip and realized the ineptitude of the staff Too late to turn around
12983,1,4 consecutive weeks Every Monday the dining room is not swept or mopped They dont open at 530am For the last month on Mondays they wont have orange juice They say the machine doesnt work and they cant serve it The cashier tells me Some other worker will squeeze the orange because its freshly squeezed I would understand one mistake but its occurring every Monday
7443,1,No leadership to teach how to run business
27806,1,Automated McDonalds dont expect excellent customer service food is always mediocre
27786,1,I ordered the 2 for 449 crispy chicken biscuits for breakfast and they gave me the 2 for 3 mc chicken sandwich and then when I asked the manager Monicawhy was i charged so much for sandwiches I didnt order she told me that she was shortstaffed and didnt have time to fix it and gave me an attitude
27785,1,Having to pay for a cup of water is outrageous 2 for a cup of water should not be the norm Who do they think they are Nestle
24544,1,Ordered a spicy chicken sandwichbit  into the sandwich and it was a bit hard to chew the sandwich was undercooked not happy with this at all
24545,1,It was already a bad experience from the moment I met the window attendant at Pickup 1  She told me we ran out of eggs and just left me there at the window without telling me they were making more Then she came back s few minutes later and handed me my foodBig Breakfast which is supposed to come with OJ and I asked for salt and pepper and she said it was already in the bag which it is NOT and then shut the window in my face The meat wasnt fully cooked and the eggs still runnie I walked in to find out she is the actual manager I told her I was about to shut the window in my face I was gonna ask for Ketchup She then snarkley replied I didnt shut the window in your face Have a nice day
24546,1,"Just went through the drive thru young lady at payment window needs additional training on what is considered proper customer care  She was having a full on conversation with a coworker related to a personal matter candy she had sitting on the counter next to her the other coworker indicated she had a customer to which she stated  I dont care  She continued her conversation leaving me sitting there until she finished Never said hello or thank you
Once I received my food it was in a bag dripping with grease
I should have driven a quarter mile up the road to Wendys
Shameful"
27782,1,"Lst night the cashier wouldnt assist in exchanging a nugget meal for a nugget happy meal due to their broken kiosk misplaced the order Neither would sell the toy itself to help a child get their wanted toy instead sold a seperate happy meal box Coffe was cold too

Next day went bck hoping to get a different experience the guy on the floor was really nice and polite but the middle eastern cashiers not so much Im standing their waiting to be assisted but instead the latina looking and the middle eastern had a more important conversation of how to remove her nose piercing and how to clean it Also she was manipulating her nose while at the csshier So so disgusting Grosss"
27781,1,While sitting down eating A manager was arguing with an elderly gentleman Very disrespectful Will never got black again
12969,1,This is one if the nastiest McDonalds EVER  The service here is TERRIBLE
7475,1,why you guys always forget items after the ordering
12965,1,To many people the place is so nasty and slow service
27779,1,Ordered the curbside orders but waited around 20 mins since the staff totally forgot to take the meals out I ordered regular iced latte but got suuuuper sweet latte instead Even got the overcooked bun on my muffin Worst experience

27776,1,Nasty Shift manager and drive thru lady treat customers like a burden nonsense of customer service Kitch n always Dirty I definitely would not suggest coming here
27775,1,Lost our order Waited 45 min for a burger fries and a box of nuggets Then they accuse us of trying to get a duplicate order for Free They clearly have problems  We tossed a twenty dollar bill at them and asked for the food NEVER GO to this location  EVER
27773,1,I understand the profitdrive to push automation but it seems to not work here 35 minutes wait for two standard egg McMuffin meals mid morning is unacceptable for fast food

27789,1,this mcdonalds is not open 24 hours despite all signage and hours posted an employee rudely shooed me away when i showed up at 130 AM
12971,1,Poor service didnt receive what I ordered 
24535,1,I usually frequent McDonalds at least once a week whether its to grab a coffee or get some pancakes for my little one This visit was probably the worst Ive experienced I ordered my food at 911AM  A mcgriddle a coffee and two hashbrowns Once I paid I was immediately told to go to 1 so I did After waiting until 930AM with no one in the drive thru line anymore I went back around where a female with red hair came walking out with a guy who looked like they knew each other After handing me my bag I asked about my drink and she said What drink I said the coffee thats listed on the ticket you provided me along with the receipt She said okay and then CONTINUED to hold a conversation with the guy standing right in front of me I waited an additional 2 minutes and she was still talking and laughing with the guy while me a customer was watching her and patiently waiting for my coffee Needless to say my patience went thin and I told her to forget about it and I had to leave I paid for something I never received and was treated with the most disrespect in my book Coming from a long time McDonalds customer I wont be back again
27805,1,Companies need to understand its not 2020 anymore The public is tired of your excuses Be aware this location starts breakfast at 4am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash and mobile orders are not accepted and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this Maybe its legit seems shady though If anything it is poor management It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be But you should have it ready to go by time your breakfast hours start and the mobile app should not be accepting orders
7447,1,NO TOILET PAPER WHEN I WENT BAD BAD
27803,1,Very rude I came early morning today and no one came over speaker I watched them hand the car in front me food out the window But yet they paid no mind to me being outside the window They passed by and didnt say a word or even acknowledge I was there but yet several employees passed by and saw me Even if you were closed despite sign stating 24 hrs the lease you could do is have some decency and say something Really poor service T
27802,1,Made an order online Arrived 15 later The place was packed We waited 50 minutes in the store for our food We got the wrong nugget sauces We were missing 2 LG fries and 2 LG sweet ts The manager behind the counter was very rude to the customers This place is a wreck

27796,1,The lady at the drivethru window was so rude and angry for no reason that I cancelled my order and drove away The lady would only answer with one word answers and was not even polite Drove to BurgerKing across the street where I was treated nicely and my order was completed with no problems or childish employees
27795,1,"Terrible servicewe have to go back 3  times since they forgot my big mac    bbqs
Sauce  sweet sour souce  and my large order  fries with only half full  The last thing is herzelnut iced coffee  with none flavor that I have to dumped away after first dip  The most important thing is The only one staff seems so mad at work When she doing the friesone empty fries bag dropped on the floorshe got so pissed  threw a whole bunch fries bag on the floor  She seems the manager no other staff dared to point this out They all just keep silent and clean the mess If you are not in the mood go home plz When comes to customer service be nice then  That is the priority of your duty and responsibility"

24547,1,It was awful 45 min to get lunch Lines of people complaining  No ice in the soda machine  Told them we wanted are money  back  They found are food
27851,1,horrible horrible horrible manager at night unfortunatly i didnt catch her name but shes the oldest one in the night shift atleast on most days when i come today is 592022 and its 1210am and all i did was ask her if my order was still there cuz on my screen it disappeared and she just kept saying U GOTTA KEEP WAITING so i said i dont mind waiting i just want to know if my order is on ur side cuz it disappeared on my side and she rolled her eyes and said LIKE I SAID YOU HAVE TO KEEP WAITING and its not the first time this happens i was here one day when she yelled at a customer saying I TOLD YOU UR APPLE PIES ARENT READY YET that someone else went up to her and told her she needs to calm herself down so disrespectful and rude and she should not be working anywhere where it involves guests cuz obviously she has no patience you can ask her for some ketchup and she rolls her eyes right ahead
24519,1,"Good luck being served if you have questions about allergies We asked one of the employees to check the ingredients of the chicken nuggets to make sure there were no dairy allergens He asked his manager to check She straight out refused We couldnt even complete one of our orders

30 minutes after placing our other order we received fries so cold when I went up to the front to get fresh ones I didnt even have to say anything One of the employees brought me new ones automatically after the manager ignored my presence

The bathrooms were nasty the tables were dirty every trash can was over flowing and the whole lobby smelled like rotten fish This is easily the worst McDonalds in Orlando"
13059,1,"This Black lady at cash register took my order fine another black lady with dark blue shirt red brown hair served my food
Minutes later I return one item was made wrong
Same black lady asked her staff to fix it then she gave it to me without checking it and I find out that they did it wrong again I took to her for the third time and then she asked her staff again to do it again
Instead of making sure its done correct She proceeded to go help another customer which took her about 4 to 5 minutes when she knew I come first but she didnt care I asked her again when she returned to her post where is my food and She got quickly defensive with me and refuse to get me a hot free fries since I had to wait too long for my order
I throw away my cold fries and just proceeded to get the hell out of there
I am done arguing with these black or not black l management fault They just hire any one for the job and they dont pay attention to what goes on in thei"
7332,1,Homeless people sleeping near the entrance wayManagement didnt seem to care
7333,1,They  didnt  put  in my  chisburger  cheese  and meat
27896,1,Drive thru is the biggest mistake  They Assured me everything was in the bag  And nope no 20 piece chicken nuggets 
13057,1,Vomit and urine from the homeless at the entry turned my stomach and couldnt order food My wife and I were so turned off we canceled or sightseeing plans in LA and left town It
27895,1,There were people inside but they were closed but they did sell food only that I could not buy because I did not have a car If they are open for take away they should not DISCRIMINATE someone because he does not have a car
27894,1,No contact with the workers till they delivered  Basically you were ignored unless you yelled loudly for attention  Very disappointed and will never visit there again Remover the kiosk in order to give a one on one personal touch  Even a good morning GO BACK TO COUNTER HELP PLEASE
13053,1,Definitely everything has changed in this McDonalds location The food was alright what I didnt like was the area location homeless getting crazy inside the restaurant Looks like the one security who
13052,1,On Nov 2221 I went to use the mens restroom and it was so filthy and because this is a place where a lot people visit the attention to the restrooms should be made more often
24494,1,Was awful at this location FILTHY Had staff just moving trays of trash around from table to table The self pay was out of order took 15 minutes for someone to notice we were at the registers to pay with only 2 other customers in the restraunt Even while patio obviously designed patio was horrendous Trash everywhere spilled drinks on every table Very sad since this location Im sure sees a lot of visitors
13050,1,The worst and most expensive McDonalds I have ever seen I had to request a manager to intervene before the cashier would let me order what I wanted instead of what she wanted me to buy Definitely not a happy meal
7344,1,I went to get some dollar items which they did not have
27886,1,My quarter pounder with cheese was old cold and dry
24496,1,Terrible service  Poorly run  3 out of 4 kiosks were down for ordering This was the only option to order at 11pm at night on a Sat  Place was very busy no cashiers on the line  Took a number for food to be delivered  Called receipt to pick up order at counter  Order wrong  Forgot Cookie and drink cup  Had to go back up to ask for it  Counter person did not apologize   I will never come back here
7349,1,Poor service rude attitude
24489,1,Absolute worse McDonalds Ive ever been to  Restrooms were a mess ordered food gave up after 30 minutes and gave receipt to some other folks waiting for their order
24488,1,Took forever which Ive gotten used too being a very popular location close to the tourist traps of international drive But the service and order quality has been way less that satisfactory more times than I could count And not to forget neither of my kids of my kids even got the Pokemon toy or any toy for that matter that they asked for
27899,1,Worst McDonalds I have ever been to The food was dry we had to ask for our drinks three times and we had to ask for the Happy Meal toy There was one helpful young woman working front cash who got the last drink sorted out But wont be back unless management starts checking in and doing a better job motivating employees
7327,1,Every time I come here something is wrong with their payment system or one of their machines is broken
24481,1,26min in queue is when the manager tells me i have to make my order in one of the machines because she doesnt have someone who can take my order Really sad i waist my time and did not get my strawberry shake International Driveway to busy for this time of the day They need more personal
27909,1,I sat in drive through Tuesday night around 1130 PM for 20 minutes and pull up to order and associate says sorry we are closed I explained to him that I had been waiting already for over 20 minutes and he mumbled something and said sorry the website says open 24hrs
13078,1,I ordered from here twice and I ordered a cheeseburger with bacon and onions and the first time they didnt even put the bacon on it The bacon that I spend my money on and now they didnt put the onion on it
7311,1,No answer phono
27908,1,Worst ever spent 45 minutes in line and then they never took my order through the intercom finally made it to the front they took forever to give me my order then get home to see a combo missing UGH then I call to complain and they never answered the phone Horrible management
13077,1,This plave is not a good place They used to have blacks there too Now all hispanic and trey just remodeled All of sudden after the remodel all the staff all like the same race I though McDonalds was equal opportunity employer Guess not Today I went there to use the restroom I was told I couldnt use the restroom unless I bought something I explained that it was an emergency and I just have to take a number one and I will be on my way I asked to speak to the manager the manager told me the same thing you have to buy something I told the manager I really had to use the restroom it was an emergency Ill be in and out thats all I need it and I was still denied Every time I come to this place is always something Things to give me cold food all the time I would ask for fresh food and they would make me wait 20 to 30 minutes I would just wait while standing there looking at her I wasnt really strong with expressing myself oh now I express myself a little bit more I just thought that everybody should know is this place really isnt a nice place to be I wouldnt give them a dime of my money When did they treat people and Ive always treated people is not okay if I was a business owner in a McDonalds along to me I would fire the entire staff shut the McDonalds down and start new with the whole new staff of all Races and ethnicities different religions in different ways of being themselves instead of running it like Fort Knox and no one even speaks English Not a respectable place and I think a lot of changes need to happen The last thing that we all need is a petition being signed to shutdown a very nasty disrespectful unprofessional in very unreliable restaurant in one of the most popular places in California Lets get back together McDonalds or else Ill go to the next level and bringing all these customers that also its like this McDonalds We even go one more step above and bring the in all your future customers who have never been there before just to mention on how theyve had experiences at McDonalds that were so exceptionally great and then compare it to the way that you treat all the customers whove walked out of McDonalds and see if theyll never come back I dont think we want this to be a topic of discussion
13073,1,Too many homeless people that kept walking in and out of this location we couldnt eat comfortably because they smelled so bad as they passed by I understand they cant help it due to their situation but if you have a hard time tolerating body odor of various homeless people walking back and forth in this McDonalds location then you should definitely avoid this location
7350,1,its fast food but slow you now
13072,1,"Really rude staff too bad service Avoid if you can There are so many other better places to eat or drink around
They would literally cheat you"
13068,1,So overall they usually have one of the fastest services especially when it comes to McDonalds in regards to what Im doing doordash Only problem being at this location is a hub for intoxicated panhandling homeless people
24486,1,Service and costumer service awful horrible
27902,1,"Terrible 1st no cashier they force us to use the non user friendly kiosk
2nd why ask us to take a table number if you dont deliver the food
3rd 6 dirty tables
Dont you forget they are many other fast food options"
27901,1,I just want to warn people that they have a beautiful playground that you can see from the outsidebut its closed 
7323,1,"Too much tarter sauce on fish fillet
Cheeseburger buns hard  stale"
7324,1,I dont know 
7325,1,Service at these store is very bad and they get wrong order and
24482,1,I wish there were warning signs on the drive in Turn back now unless you have 30 minutes to wait in the drive thru to order pay and receive your food Once you pull in and someone comes up behind you you are stuck Hopefully you dont want any Coke with your meal And forget any all day breakfast items that will add an additional 20 minutes on to your wait Havent even tasted my food yet Do not recommend
24497,1,Service was incredibly slow they were out of coke dr Pepper didnt work and they have light lemonade instead of normal All while we were in a hurry to get to the park  Very unpleasant experience
27883,1,Manager was the absolute worst The talent pool must be real slim They need to seek management with some sorta personality
13043,1,"To many young kids was there
the place was to busy for family  tourism"
24507,1,Arrived starving from water park30 minutes after ordering large order of food no deals on that was on other branches still no food so asked staff who said would look into it 45 minutes later one staff arrived with sandwich only out of 4 meals and desserts saying rest coming 1 hour later rest of order arrived no desserts and on checking burger brought was wrong Went down to complain so called manager shrugged shoulders said other stuff sent up and was attitude of so what that was terrible service Half machine for kids to play upstairs broke and ridiculous amount of tickets to get smallest prize Will never be back If u want mcdonalds go to smaller local branch as will have deals and hopefully better service
24508,1,I couldnt tell you much about the food or service because it wasnt open Supposedly 24 hour location but closed for maintenance  The sign had been updated closed from 11pm to 4am and then changed again to 5am I gave up hope at 520am when it didnt look like it was going to happen  Oh well good luck
27865,1,The drive through guy was super disrespectful and awful to deal with We had ordered online and they said it didnt go through even though it charged us so instead of providing a solution he stood staring not saying anything As well as when we got the food and asked if that was all and he rolled his eyes and said nothing Absolutely one of the worst experiences in a drive through 0
24509,1,Went new years Eve and was a disaster 4 employees in the heart of tourist districtWe ordered at Kiosk and waited 15 mins and saw that others that had been There for 25mins hadnt even paid for much less gotten their food Would have just done as much good to have shut the doors and locked as opposed to being open
7381,1,Slow and order was wrong several times
13018,1,Homeless hang out  Every day customers are being attacked in the store why security guards stand around and watch 
24512,1,This Mc Donalds its always really slow Simple orders like a Quarter Pound and Mc Nuggets can take forever Im already waiting 40 minutes on Curbside Pickup and nothing It already happened sometimes I will not come back to this Mc Donalds anymore Terrible customer service
27868,1,Lines longer than Disney Staff walk around clueless half the time Not sure if understaffed or undertrained Corporate needs to come and take a look at this one or shut it down Been this way for years now Always the same Always cash only at night
13015,1,Horrible service walked in with wife an 3 kids ordered 3 pancake meals an 2 sandwich meals 5 people 5 meals they called our order got 1 pancake 2 sandwiches no full meals had to wait as they dissed us in Spanish I speak it I know what you said then get my other 2 pancakes but they absolutely refused to give me 2 hash browns will not stop again
24513,1,Sat in the drive thru for 30 minutes before being able to order Part of the delay was due to another car deciding thier time was more valuable by cutting the line so it pushed three other cars besides mine back in line Two other cars followed suit so we couldnt even leave when we wanted to and were forced to stay and order because we along with the traffic trying to leave the parking lot was blocked in When I called to complain while forced to stay in line I was on hold for 6 minutes before hanging up because the manager didnt want to answer my call
24514,1,Unbelievably poor service Ordered 3 items 2 bagged immediately but then waited 15 mins for final item  a double cheeseburger By this time first 2 items cold so asked for a fresh re order  30 mins later Walked out with barely an apology Given the numerous bad reviews for this outlet you would expect a change in personnel Avoid if you can dont expect if you cannot
24515,1,Normally visit this location 4 out of 7 days a week usually early mornings and staff dont seem to want to be there which is ok because it is early 530am On 42119 the frappe machine is down for cleaning at 5am and now on 42219 the system is completely down Its becoming a place that isnt dependable
27858,1,DO NOT GO HERE  This was the most unprofessional treatment that we ever received by McDonalds We felt like we couldnt even report it because we didnt have a name to call up the next day and speak to a manager he wouldnt even give us a name
27856,1,"Dont eat here Order is always wrong takes forever fries are cold and gross Dining room closes at 11pm NOPE Really closes at like 8pm Update the hours on your door When we knocked on the door and pointed to the sign THE MANAGER FLIPPED US OFF

Cooperate needs to fire most the staff all the managers and get new people in there"
24518,1,What a horrible experience I sat at the front counter for over 15 mins for utensils and sauce on Dec 21st at 945pm The so called manager and the employees never once acknowledged me nor other customers that walked up for assistance with their orders that THEY messed up Honestly the manager should be fired or retrained she had no customer service skills or manager skills at that This mcdonalds makes the rest look bad
7395,1,Stopped serving all day breakfast
27861,1,Have to order by computer and no one to help Asked for no mustard and crispy fries  Had 6 workers talking about a ring instead of just looking at me as I asked for help Bathroom are nasty  Wont go back again

27881,1,They wont take my order I had to use the self serving one n they didnt take our food to the table as the number thingy said
27880,1,"24 hours its a joke right
I arrived from my trip at 300am today 022622 and the cashier notified me to wait
After 30 minutes without attending to me in the selfservice line I decided to check if there was someone to attend me and nobody came out or said anything  It is a lack of respect"
13040,1,So I come in for my daily coffee but need to use the restroom and of course you have to buy before you can use the restroom and wash hands 
27878,1,Self ordering stations inside offer a milk alternative for coffee and thats what we thought we got Went through the drive through to be told they dont offer such a thing My husband was in the middle of explaining the situation to the manager at the window when she just turned and walked away My husband had to get her attention to finish explaining that the menu inside has it on there She was slightly aggressive  we left
24499,1,Giant line in the drive through had to wait for about 5 minutes per car and after about 15 minutes we decided to not order there
24501,1,I could have gave 5 stars if it stayed original I liked the safari jungle vibe I went with my girlfriend on July 13th at night time It wasnt crowded and surprised that they renovated and got rid of golden women bathroom 
13037,1,The worker could not get my order on time and had an attitude
7373,1,Online orders are not honoured here

27877,1,Just went to this location Worst service I ever had I was unable to process my orden with the Kiosk After I couldnt make the order I was standing at the line and the employee said all orders needed to be thru the Kiosk I told them I tried it and was unable to complete the order and I prefer wanted to do it thru cashier Manager Jennifer was rude and said that if I wanted to do it with a cashier I had to do it via drive thru To be honest that is totally disrespectful and unprofessional Where is the customer service or Customer Service satisfaction You can not force your customers to do only kiosk What about people that cant read Are they not allowed to go inside the restaurant just because they cant make the order at the kiosk
13033,1,They fired me for refusing service to a rude customer
27875,1,I ordered cookies and chocolate chip then I went to pay The cashier was very rude he didnt greet me didnt look me in the eye and just announced  the price with no manners such as please The lady at the drive through just shoved the bag at us no eye contact either Training for the workers at this Mcdonalds is lacking
27874,1,This is the worst experience Ive ever had at a McDonalds Waited in line for over 40 mins at the drive thru then found out my filetofish I ordered was automatically removed from the mobi

24548,1,Spent over 30 minutes waiting in line at the drive thru at around 9 pm Finally placed my order of 2 egg mcmuffins Recieved 2 egg mcmuffins that must of been sitting since the morning hours from breakfast The white portion of the egg was almost black They are supposed to make them fresh after breakfast hours not serve on from 12 hours prior
12960,1,all the employees speak spanish and there was homeless people farting inside
24549,1,Horrible service waited over 40 min for my cold food No one wanted to speak up but i did manager turns around and tells me we are short staffed but no excuse for them dragging their feet and cracking jokes to each othertotal opposite of a FAST food joint I would of had better luck and service an actual sit down place
24575,1,We went here late night after EDC Around 2am we waited about an hour to get our food Whatever its the night of EDC so it was crowded ok In a 22 order we were missing 2 items equaling 8 and a sweet and sour sauce that they charged me 2 for After going back and telling them what happened they argued I eventually got the egg sandwich and double bacon cheeseburger which ended up having no bacon Still never got that 2 sweet and sour
7596,1,Sucks

7600,1,Hit or miss
27669,1,They are advertising the new crispy chicken sandwich meal for 6 yet lied twice once saying it was a mobile order which is a lie I took a pic second that it didnt start so why advertise so sad worse customer service in Mcdonalds
27668,1,This McDonalds is HORRIBLE PERIOD The food is always coldfries soggy  nuggets soggy And if you ask for sauce make sure you got it cause even if you paid the 50cent FEE you still might not have gotten it
24578,1,at Night they didnt give happy meal drink they have a sign for if they dont  offer new dessert they will give a free dessert But they never mention about it So I requested them to give a free dessert They dont want to give a free dessert

24583,1,Hire more staffing during evening hours Waited about 25 min with only about 4 cars ahead of me before finally giving up Be more proactive and tell customers if there will be a long wait
27660,1,All those renovations in appearance makes no difference if the staff is unprofessional and simply ghetto Then again it is in Newark smh I was not aware that this particular Mc Donalds was not a corporate store honestly I wouldnt know how to differentiate one from the other In any case to my understanding every Mc Donalds ran the same policy in regards to the food they sell obviously So when I go to get my coffee everyone knows you are entitled for one free refill but to my surprise this Mc Donalds does not honor that The person at the register whos name is Estella mexican woman was the one who took my order and made me feel real uncomfortable and awkward when I asked politely for my refill There were others on line waiting to take their order and I feel like she deliberately embarrassed me There was no need to make me feel degraded at the end of the day I am a customer and I have no need to bring my business here I should of took my business where I noramlly go which is the one located on Washington Ave in Belleville That just goes to show you how true the phrase is Never judge a book by its cover
27659,1,They cant get Uber eats orders right this is the third and last time it will happen again They completely forgot 4 medium fries

24584,1,Order from the kiosks cause all the POS were unmanned and closed Paying by cash made this a pain but not only that as everyone else was ordering and having thier order number shouted across the restaurant we waited and waited until after 30 mins got uo to ask how our order wasnt called or even on the board we were told we had to queue to replace the order and pay Utter farce after being here multiple times and having no problems this was a shambles and insulting
12883,1,They never get your order right not even when you tell em at the counter NO CHEESEIDIOTS
12907,1,the slowest mc donalds in the hood they dont care about us
24569,1,Super impolite drive thru and cashier We had to repeat the order three times bc she was talking to someone else and they didn
24568,1,New and clean but horrible service

12943,1,The bums outside make you not want to come here and the service was slow
12937,1,stale fries had to ask for remake there oil wasnt filtered good enough
27736,1,Absolutely disgusting please tare this place down and build a Wendys with new  employees I wasted my money I urge you not to waste your money and
27735,1,The food is always cold theres always a long wait time and some of the managers just dont care One of them was mad I complained about my fries not being cooked all the way so he snatched them out of my childs hand and those were not even the ones I was complaining about he then asked me if I had a recipe When he was the one that took my money and didnt give me one
27734,1,I came to this mcdonalds to pick up an order for a customer as I deliver with Uber Eats and the manager refused to make the order because he said we are too busy and dont have the time to prepare such a big order plus these are lunch and dinner items we will be switching over to breakfast in 20 minutes So my customer was cheated out of their order and I was screwed out of 35 I reported the restaurant to Uber support as well as Mcdonalds corporate offices Avoid this mcdonalds if you can Terrible
12936,1,Another BAD experience at this McDonalds It makes no sense the things they do Pray pray pray
27732,1,"Drive through experience Long line no problem tourist area Took a while to take my order When I paid the person didnt even make eye contact he gave me my receipt without saying a word except for the total and shut the window Then went to the 2nd window where the guy gave me the water bottle and sent me to the 3rd window By the time I paid at 1002 pm it was 1020 pm and I was still waiting on anyone to come to the 3rd window Then a female employee brought me a kids meals and when I asked her for the rest of the order she waved her hand and said I dont know with an attitude She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries cold nuggets no toy no sauce no napkins When I showed the kids meal he said what happened to the fries as if we ate them I looked at him and said thats what you guys gave me and to look at the camera He then said hold on and slammed the window Another 5 mins go by gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag but it wasnt there As he was getting me the sauce I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review He shrugged his shoulders slammed the window and left I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window but he never did
Im a store manager myself and I would never tolerate a behavior like that from any of my managers or from any of my team members My 6 year old granddaughter was in the car and was crying with this upsetting situation
I visit this location at least 34 times a week never had problems like this with the other shifts"
24561,1,Horrible customer service tried to order at the register and the manager talked to me like I was a child and had to order at the kiosk Mean while half the kiosk in the building was not working
24562,1,One of my worst experiences at a McDonalds ever   I waited in a line at the drive through for 20  minutes  Get to the first window where I hand them my card and end up paying for someone elses order   Waited longer to correct that situation  The order at the window was wrong  Waited some more for that to be corrected  Finally the lid to my soda wasnt on so when I went to grab it in the car the lid popped off the cup and spilled all over me
27737,1,"First im looking at my receipt I ordered two cheeseburger happy meals and only got a hamburger with one pickle on it Then the manager tries to tell me that the drinks are dispensed on how you water them I threw my receipt at him I ordered a sweet tea and dr pepper
I was given a hic 

Untop of it I wish I can post a photo of my two orders of fries thrown on the groud because they were uncooked"
27729,1,Food was fine But when we came a large family were at the cash taking kiosks so we used a regular kiosk and waited to pay cash at the register When the manager came to take cash they gave a look like we were crazy then said you you know we have a cash kiosk to which I responded that people are at it It wasnt overly rude but execution was totally annoyed at us the customer Hope its not like that next time we visit
27755,1,Sign indicates free item if the person taking your order doesnt ask about rewards The Male taking our order didnt ask We told them at the window The manager told us the girl that took our order did ask us we explained that it wasnt a girl it was the man To which she rolled her eyeswalked away and didnt return We also didnt recieve our bottle water napkins  nor straws for the drinks we did get
27758,1,Lucky they even get the rating they do Placed a mobile app order at 949am and was still waiting for 3 sandwiches 45 minutes later Not a single person acknowledged me standing at the front counter but had no problem passing orders out to those using the kiosk Go thru the drive thru to be given the excuse that their short handed yet I spent 45 minutes INSIDE and seen plenty of employees My order was wrong twice Absolutely cold food Sent a complaint to corporate because this is unacceptable This location is full of tourist and I hate for these people visiting our state and area to be treated the way I was Absolutely uncalled for
12958,1,Drink machine disgusting I just wanted Sweet Tea ugh
27768,1,"TERRIBLE SERVICE
Asked for the manager for refil e he turn around and started to do another thing completely different ZERO ATTENTION TO CUSTOMER I"
24550,1,Store is unprofessional not open during business hours When does that happen at mcdonalds Not a good look
27765,1,If I could I would give 10 stars because I stayed here in Orlando all week and they never wanted to take my order they locked all the doors at night they say they close at 11pm and for example I arrived at 940 and they told me that it was closed please McDonalds do something this is happening to me all nights Im from Mexico and I dont have a car or the App from here even if its the same is different they are rude and not attentive 
24551,1,HORRIBLE It took 54 mins to get our food and then it was nasty We watched the manager mix sweet and unsweet to fill a mans tea Noone ever asked for our order so we pulled forward at the window Will NEVER stop at this location on our way home from Seaworld EVER
27763,1,Not satisfied with purchase Female manager messed up my order twice My tripple hamburger looked like someone added two miniature paddies on a normal size burger I would recommend that this supervisor pays attention to receipts and ask for additional help in order to avoid mistakes
12954,1,Food order wrong 1 person taking orders and serving drive up orders and counter To long of wait
24559,1,"The ONLY reason I gave this place one star is because I couldnt give it ZERO
we ordered on a kiosk at McDonalds because the counter line was too long  Come to find out its because the kiosks werent taking payment  I then proceeded to wait in line FOR AN HOUR to just PAY for my food  When I asked for a refund for my friends food the manager pointed at food that had been sitting there no less than 10 mins and said its coming  Uh no  Needless to say we got our refund and ended up going across the street to iHOP instead  Shout out to the waiter at iHOP and the whole staff for doing so much better than McDonalds"
7495,1,Ice cream machine broke
7497,1,Service isnt that good
24555,1,WORST MCDONALDS EVER unfortunately I cannot leave less then 1 star They have 10 automatic screens to place your order from but only if you want breakfast cant order lunch from them A completely waste of my time and money Your better off going across the street to Burger King and getting a whopper
27761,1,"Food was cold drinks missing
The manager is rude the advertising is false She accused us of lieing when we said we werent asked about the rewards to receive the free cookie  Very hostile "

28752,1,Horrible McDonalds I had visited this McDonalds in the late evening and I was getting cussed out by a employee mopping the floor How would I supposed to know what area are you mopping without a sign or just tell me politely to watch my step I wouldve kept coming to this McDonalds but if someone is mopping the floor and cussing customers out for walking on the wet floor needs to be fired
5815,1,Rude staff Happened a few nights ago While dining upstairs with my family and a few more guests in another table the spanish speaking lady staff told us arrogantly to leave as they were already closing She could have informed us in a nicer way But when we went down new customers were still coming in

28747,1,The last in a string of bad experiences I only received half my order and it was still wrong Genuinely impressive how almost every experience at this location is terrible Wont be returning
28746,1,I live close so I frequent this location They almost always get my very simple order wrong and they cant even use the most basic forms of respect such as speaking to a customer They just take the card hand it backmost of the times without the receipt and at the next window hand you your incorrect order without so much as a word Head a few miles down A1A and get much better service with a friendlier staff
28745,1,Worst McDonalds in the area After waiting in line over 20 minutes I finally get to the window for them to inform me that they were closed Mind you this was at 112 am Saturday morning The store hours for this location reads closes at 3 am not 112 am Clearly management didnt want to serve any more customers due to high volume not because they were closed or closing Will never go back to this location

And the fries were luke warm"

28732,1,When I approached the window the gentleman cashier just looked at me I said Hello and he did not speak I handed him my card and he took it as if he were frustrated When he handed the card back to me I said Thank you and he said nothing back Im not one to usually make a big deal about things I try not to be that person however the way he acted was so unnecessary Maybe I reminded him of someone I do not know and never will know I just refuse to go to this location again

23145,1,An abysmal excuse of a restaraunt this location is a McDonalds only in name With a wait time of 1015 minutes at best for even the simplest order this location completely and utterly fails in its purpose as a fast food location I strongly recommend any reader to take their time and money to ANY other location

14662,1,"Just to preface Im not a McDonalds regular so I dont know what the norm is for this location
I placed a mobile order and when I came to pick up it disappeared into the backroom chaos  About 10 minutes go by and there were people overflowing the drivethrough and the indoor registers  I figured Id just hang out and just check in every once in a while since I had nothing pressing to do
Dozens of orders went through while I was there  Most of them went through slowly and a LOT needed substitutions since many products werent available  The stores CO2 went down so they couldnt give out soda  Bottled drinks were being subbed for soda shakes being subbed for ice cream lemonades being subbed for tea  They were trying with what they had but what an absolute madhouse  Listening to the regulars in line it sounds like this has been common recently

This exercise of curiosity went on so long an hour that there seemed to be a shift change  Two of the new employees got together and figured out my mobile order  Apparently mobiles dont process automatically and need some kind of manual start by an employee  which didnt happen the previous times I asked  Because of this Im sure that this doesnt reflect in their service metrics at all

The employee that was able to help me asked first for my order number  The number she was looking for was supposed to be something like 756 or 1691 like you see on your paper receipts
However that number is not actually sent to you via the app nor by email  That sounds like an oversight with mobile ordering rather than the local store
After they figured it out it took maybe 30 seconds to get my food  Super weird experience"
5389,1,Does not open when it says they are in the morning Super disappointing every time i come here Save your time and money and go somewhere else
14665,1,"Good morning Please tell me if this matters or if Im being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned Maybe because I didnt have my coffee this morning

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning This morning I forgot my wallet I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than 500 breakfast tomorrow They said so sorry No I pleaded with this new manager that Id never seen before I asked for the manager that Id spoken with on several occasions
She refused to see me and he stated that her response would be the same I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us He said it would be discarded

Seriously I asked So I said that youd rather throw it away then let me have it a faithful customerSo my lesson is now Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson McDonalds doesnt care about my patronizing their establishment and Im going to seriously break my coffee habit No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me
A lesson well learned can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded"
23287,1,They forgot 3sandwiches after they pulled me up n the food was not hot

23309,1,Because we had a big order they kept giving our food to other people who had smaller orders People who ordered after us had already eaten and left by the time we got our food
5364,1,Keiosk ordering for fast food is horrible removes the people element of jobs Service was very slow with this system and I will not be a part of this again It sucks

14735,1,Too many flies in the kitchen Poor food and a sloppy looking man who supposedly managed Did not notice filthy cup handed to me for drink An awesome employee noticed and gave me clean cup Dirty restaurant poor management great woman supervisor
5301,1,"I ordered a Sprite and waited for my receipt and watched the girl throw it away as I waited Ok I drive through to pick up and am told that Sprite is out

My issue is that no one knew Not when I placed my order or when I went to pay Even the guy at the 2nd window didnt know until he tried to get my drink

So I ask for my money back The guy asked me for my receipt For a dollar in the drive thru I told him the lady didnt give me one He takes a few minutes and then asks me to pull forward

For a dollar I reply Bc really this is ridiculous The last time I pulled forward no one ever came Plus the guy didnt even confirm what I am waiting for  a manager or my dollar

I finally got my dollar tho"
14734,1,I thought It would be nice to stop at McDonalds because I dint want to cook today place my order the young lady that took my payment was nice and friendly but the person that was handing the food out had an attitude problem I asked for a cup holder and she looked at me like I stole something and when she handed my food to me she act like I was disturbing her so I will not go back to that McDonalds no more 111 west Madison Street in oak Park Im sorry her day going bed but you chose to work there I did not force you to work though thats the career path you chose and my fries are cold and old dint want to drive ba CV k lesson learned they lost a customer

5305,1,Cant take an order I ordered 2 happy meals and they recorded one At the pay window I corrected their mistake and paid for two Then at the second window they only gave me one and insisted I only paid for one They absolutely refused to give me 4 little nuggets and a couple of fries This is the McDonalds closest to my house and I go there frequently Well not anymore I hope the 499 they stole from me with make up for the 40 I typically spend there weekly
5306,1,My daughter and I stopped in for a quick bite about 330 on Saturday 14th We were charged for something that should have been free The young female supervisor or manager that had to take care of the refund was very rude and unapologetic for their mistake The worst customer service Ive had in that square in years  Perhaps when they did the remodel they should have gotten rid of the terrible staff as well Come on McDonalds you can do better than that Please take some pride and have expectations for your employees serving your public Terrible place I truly hope they fire that supervisor trust me shes not worth the money shes being paid
5298,1,This Balboa McDonalds is one of the worst in town I dont know why I keep going back Well not anymore Todays mess up after a long slow line and being asked to pull up and wait I got home and was missing 2 cheeseburgers  Clearly on my

14728,1,"This place is the worst and we come here twice a day and dont know why

I always get our food wrong every time no matter what

The people running the speaker and the drivethru menu do not know the product nor the day engage correctly with correct language

Not only do they not give me two extra milks today but they also spilled coffee on me in the DriveThru

Not coming back"
5311,1,McDonalds Balboa The one next to the gas station Probably the only McDonalds in area that ignores customers at the front I literally had to get agressive and ask for a Manager on duty to get some assistance What really ticked me off was when a guy came in on a wheel chair and we were both patiently waiting for some assistance Customer service definitely isnt a priority at this location No Hi welcome well be right with you Nothing When I told the woman there that they had customers all I got was a I know Unprofessional unapologetic and uncaring staff and I think the woman may have been a supervisormanager Her shirt was different from the rest Would rate this store a 0 if I could
5312,1,How do you go thru drive thru and they make you pull over to wait for you food in this heat and bring you the wrong order TWICE And than when I take it to the manager she has a whole attitude and snatches the bag and remakes it with a whole attitude

14737,1,The bacon cheese fries were cold and there was just a bit of cheese sauce on top leaving the bottom fries dry and hard My daughter purchased a Dr Pepper that taste like carbonated water with just a bit of aftertaste We went through the drivethru and it was very busy so wet just ended up tossing most of it
5295,1,This is scandalous I came to this location and it was closing one of the employees went running to put some cones on drive Thru to make it seem they are close It was 1100 pm still one more hour until they close 
14755,1,Management sucks sent someone home claimed he wasnt doing anything but he was assisting me with an order I had two different ordered and got refunds on both Two thumbs down for Erin
14754,1,Teach your employees basic math Im relying on delivery services because of the COVID outbreak closing everything Unfortunately that means Im stuck with what I get I ordered 3 hashbrowns and received 1 Did you know that 3 means there are 2 more hash browns than 1 Amazing fact isnt it Its something you shouldve learned in pre school On top of that they gave me no receipt I have no proof of this Maybe its in your computer but I demand a refund since I cant get one with the delivery app and maybe pick up the phone as I was calling this McDonalds about this over and over Thank you
14752,1,Would give it less stars if I could I purchased my meals via the McDonalds app in order to save some time when I arrived and pulled into curbside parking slot 4 and entered it into the app I received the message that this store is currently closed which it was not So I had to wait in the drive thru lane almost 15 minutes only to have the cashier charge my account twice then had to wait roughly another 10 minutes for the manager to appear only to tell me there is nothing she can do about it and I would have to contact the app department
5281,1,Something has really changed at this McDs  Went at 730pm on 819  Line of cars not moving for ages  Then finally moves and I had to get their attention at the drive thru order area  So many people there the food should have been hot and fresh  Burger and fries were stone cold  The crew seemed to be focussed on other things
14751,1,It took very long to get the food and they also didnt even know what most of the McDonalds app was

14742,1,I can tell the manager had great energy Point is she needs to hire people that look like they want to be there Clothing dysfunctional discussing issues with other customershair messy np caps  In other words Im not loving it
14739,1,I used to work here Last Wednesday I ordered an unsweetened tea no ice When I got home there was ice in it but I let it slide This time I ordered the same thing but this time its a sweetened tea I mean the short time I worked there I was in the drive through window taking orders since I was the most efficient there out of everyone and had the most enthusiasm These last 2 trips have been misfires compared to past trips Note that I go through the drive through after 11pm when its not busy at all so theres no reason to mess up an order with 2 items or less
5293,1,Easily and consistently the worst McDonalds Ive ever been to The kitchen staff either doesnt care or doesn

13859,1,I can honestly say this is the worlds worst McDonalds I have so far experienced A 45minute wait for a very simple and straightforward order Ive eaten in McDonalds all over the world and the food quality and service let this one down severely So many people were angry with ridiculous waiting times wrong orders crushed food and items not available I do not recommend it

6322,1,This place had garbage on the tables and floors It looked like a section 8 soup kitchen in there Understaffed with unprofessional delinquents they have their street friends coming from behind the counter after hanging out in the kitchen while tons of people were waiting for their food
6324,1,Turns out McDonald
13853,1,Gets jammed packed with tourist If you order on the app to pickup in store instead of thru the drive thru and decide to go inside they make you get in line for counter pickup which takes even longer Parking lot gets full with no place to park I suggest you go to a different location if you want to order and eat and park All in one place Terrible experience
6326,1,The security hear are a hassle  You cant eat in peace  I have a digestive problem and she is watching her clock Shes unprofessional and disrespectful to paying customers She is pushing out  You need to address her aproachAnd how to handle the customers here
28440,1,The lady at the drivethru was extremely rood and they messed up my big Mac I was missing two cheeseburgers and my 10piece nugget only had seven nuggets
6328,1,Ordered McNuggets through the electronic menu and they made me select sauces but none were given in the order  The nuggets were dry and overcooked especially without any sauce  They also took my receipt when I wanted to keep it so overall a poor experience
6330,1,One of the most disgusting places i have ever been too in the world And i live in NYC In the early morning hours the place is full of herion addics doing drugs or just laying on their booths all high They put my coffee in the microwave when i asked for it to be hot Meaning it was probably from the night before   I donot recommend this place unless you are a junkie
13851,1,Absolutely manic busy The food was usually McDonalds fare however chips were cold The place seems really disorganised and half the self service kiosks were out of order I wondered if this was to help the kitchen keep up Homeless people coming in and raiding tables with food left Not a pleasant experience at all and one of the worst McDonalds I have ever visited needs security guards I feel
6313,1,I was disgusted and appolled by this mcdonalds i would suggest NEVER go here Walked in to the staff and security guard having a loud conversation or arguement im not sure but after hearing the N word 20 times and standing there not being greeted i left I felt unsafe and the staff were truly ghetto and extremely irresponsible 0 work ethic 0 respect If your a tourist avoid this location    
28446,1,Worst McDonalds  Ive ever been to Waited over twenty minutes  Burgers were almost  raw Plus no toys in happy meals
6311,1,"Security person didnt let me use the restroom without showing a receipt I said the line is long and I have to go man Id be buying something after I use the restroom I promise he said no so now Im writing this from the pizzeria next door after using the restroom two slices and a juice
Thinking of going here Go nextdoor"
6310,1,I was waiting in line with my six year old son who had to go to the bathroom  The security guard was sitting down talking to a customer I knocked on the door and realized there was no one inside So I asked him to open the door He told me that if I did not have attitude he could do it faster Then he opened the door and said Black people always have attitudes He proceeded to curse at I went to talk to the manager who pretty much ignored me and continued cooking French fries I called the corporate number This was by far the worse experience I have ever had in a McDonald
6293,1,Do not go after 9pm The store was trashed and dirty and staff moved liked theyd just smoked a spliff Very slow and had to repeat my order which was on 2 cups of coffee Try to avoid this place like the plague

55 for service"
13867,1,"Visited today Play place was out of service Dine in service was not available Some of the menu items we wanted were not available Ordered food from the machine but a staff member said he couldnt find it in the system started to retype it in the cashier Our order was customized and the worker made a few mistakes When I asked what was going on he started making rude comments and asked if I spoke English
I asked for the refund and the worker refunded me 3 less Then the manager came and fixed the refund error The manager was calm but didnt offer any apology

The saddest part is  this is a flagship McDonalds location advertised as the biggest McDonalds in the world with Play Place and Entertainment I hoped to see exemplary service and atmosphere but it was a huge disappointment

I wish next time I visit if ever to see working services friendly and competent staff and adequate food selection Peace"
6296,1,Because the female security guard that works for you is very very nasty and very unprofessional  She throws 90 of the people out for no reason  She has told the workers behind the counter not to take my order and not to serve me She has not yet been able to give anyone a reason as to why she is putting me out Majority of the people who come there She has done the same thing to She was once the warden at rikers island  but she was  caught in the big drug ring letting  the other correction officers bring in the  drugs so now she is working  in McDonalds  She has threatened  me  and has been harnessing myself and at least 50 other people  I have called the police and  they told me to call McDonalds corporate  number Something has to be done about her She has no right treating people like this

6299,1,Boy this placr was scary
6332,1,This one of the worst environments to eat and i aint too picky the place is nasty and filled with a whole lot of people with drug problems I felt a bit suspect when i walked in but still ordered the staff is rude and ignorant  got my order wrong Bur i guess they go along with the crowd that comes in and treats everyone like that Be Warned not the best place and some Mcdonalds are ok
6300,1,Its unfortunate that this location is the closet to me The staff really sucks here From the lack of smiling hospitality and theres absolutely no thank you at the end of paying for your meal and no apologies when they give you the wrong order they just hastily take the next customer Even the cleaning crew sucks I asked to be let into the bathroom and he looked at me with a blank expression There is NO diversity what so ever Only Spanish speaking crew members what a shame
13866,1,Supposedly they do close for their staff to take a break and are not 24 hours Maybe they should hire more staff or pay a decent wage Not like they can
13865,1,Just dont go food was really bad even though it a mcDonalds Tried it out 
13864,1,Very slow service took over an hour food came out separately so my food was cold by the time the rest arrived Staff didnt seem to care Food when it arrived was not as requested but was too exhausted to bother complaining any more
6305,1,This place in particular is a complete mess And that day I went in was a Saturday afternoon it was FULL of drug addicts and they took over the place I believe theres a Rehabilitation Center near by and thats the reason But however I DONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE unless you order to take out
13862,1,Went through the drive through barely said our first item and was told to hold on and she just disappeared for over 5 minutes We were being honked at by people thinking we were holding up the line I asked for a flat white in the UK thats what McDonalds calls a regular white coffee she very rudely said no you can go to Starbucks for that When we did receive our order the big Macs were replaced with basic cheeseburgers I definitely wont bother next time we are in Orlando
6308,1,The meal was good but there were to many homeless people and beggars inside this McDonalds The beggars where fairly aggressive impertinent and well prepared for tourists They wanted to push a brasilian woman next to my table to give them 20   She wanted to give them 5  but they tried to argue with her for 15 minutes It was more like threatening than arguing I was so pissed of after this experience The food is great but the management should take care about this situation and protect their guests especially tourists
28447,1,This is my second visit and its even slower and longer than my first Unbelievably long wait times in the drive through
6301,1,I wish I could give it a no star My purse got robbed inside the store and I asked the manager if he can please show me for video evidence he approached me by saying No ask those ladies raising his voice at me and walked away How helpful was the manager
13850,1,"If I could give 12 a star I would My son  I ordered a pizza each The server brought out 2 but only handed my son his I commented that we ordered 2 she had 2 on the tray but still walked away telling 1 minute as she walked away wthe other pizza walking around the entire place including going upstairs Im sure they wouldnt put 2 separate customers orders on the same tray After 10 minutes I went up to the counter to ask where my pizza was as I see a different employee walking past me wa pizza without a cover I turn to see where she was heading  it was to where my son was sitting I adked her why the cover was off  she couldnt answer To top it all off there was hair under one of my pieces of pizz Shouldnt employees be wearing hairnets or have their hair tightly up  not hanging down

Im very disappointed wthis being my 1st time here"
23862,1,The fries were old and the fish sandwich literally had a 12 slice of cheese with a pinch of tartar sauce
13848,1,I ordered the chicken sandwich and it had a fish taste Hopefully cooked in oil previously used for fish verse going bad Also dried out threw most of it way Soda was 
28424,1,The Drive Thru Was way too long there were 100 cars we we waiting 20 minutes to order Its shorter ordering inside
13822,1,Too crowded tables were a mess and they took almost 40mins to have our food ready when we ask for it they werent too helpfulfriendly The upstairs AC wasnt running or something was wrong it was too hot overall it just seems like they were understaffed for the amount of people there
6361,1,This place is horrible One of the employees allows drug addicts to use the restroom and hang out in the back I stopped here because my aunt wanted to use the restroom As soon as I took a look at the people hanging around it was obvious
23887,1,The soda the Coke and dr Pepper or both MD just straight water no ice in the machine and all the people working there are just laughing and joking around acting like a bunch of high school kids
6365,1,Terrible location Workers are slow and ghetto Some dont even wear a uniform Random people come in and out the kitchen area an
13815,1,Used a ice cream cone reward The machine was broken and asked me if I wanted something else I said a mango smoothie They ended up giving me strawberry banana Furthermore visited again and they never had my order took 30 mins for someone to help 3rd time didnt print receipt and the customer service was horrible but the whole time he had the ability to print a duplicate Stay away if you dont want to deal with them
23894,1,Open 24 hours unless closed randomly for a few hours here and there
13826,1,Thoroughly disappointed with our visit Food took ages and was mediocre at best The air con didnt work so we were sweltering Used the arcade half the machines did not work had to wait half an hour to get prizes The staff were rude and unhelpful I would advise not to bother  visiting
23897,1,a bad service only cash at 430 am they only receive Cash BAD SERVICE
6371,1,Ordered for stay and followed the kiosk to use the table service Waited for 15 mins and never delivered Went to the pick up area and dont see my order number on the display
13806,1,My family was dining there and the people that was with us got their food way before us I waited for an hour before deciding to inquire about mine and my daughters pasta dishes I stood in line for about ten minutes when a member of management came They went to look for it Was just sitting under a heat lamp We will never step foot in that McDonalds again We ordered our food at 734pm and got our food at 845pm Shame on you McDonalds
28419,1,Watched a Manager Jennifer push and put her hands on an employee while she was handing my food out the window Dont know why because the Order was 100 right This is the way employees at McDonalds are treated
6375,1,I dont know what you did to your franchise but all I wanted was a cup of coffee and it took me half an hourmight have been better if your manager was there to help people and not on her phone
13804,1,This McDonalds did not live up to the hype I saw on the internet It was crowded and small I entered and all of my expectations dropped I ordered at the kiosk since the line was long All of the items Ive seen online through social media were either unavailable or not there at all I saw the famous pizza and pasta I tried the pizza After ordering my food and sweets I waited at the only table I could find that wasnt already taken I ordered a small drink so I figured if I had to wait maybe they would at least bring me the cup so I can get a drink I was wrong I made a special request for my McFlurry and within minutes of ordering I was told my special request couldnt be done since they had already made my McFlurry I thought they would make the ice cream items last so they dont melt while waiting for the food I didnt order much and I know there was a line but I received the pizza faster than anything I waited for a total of 30 minutes for the rest of my food They waited until everything was done to bring it to me and it wasnt even good The chicken was dry and looked old my burger was cold my McFlurry was made wrong so I didnt eat that and they gave me the wrong slice of cake very disappointed The pizza was the only food item that didnt suck entirely It was very thin but tasted okay Definitely wouldnt go back ever again Not worth the trip or the hype
28418,1,Waited more than 20 mins trying to make order but they just keep saying be right with you to finally tell me they dont have what i wanted
6378,1,This McDonalds is hit or miss after you walk past the homeless and myth heads your food is nasty bread is old or fries have no salt and not fresh Outside smells like piss Pick another McDonalds caution
6370,1,"Too crowded not Too dirtybut not clean enough for me to eat inorder a coffee  gothats just me
Oh yeah Ive seen prices lower in other McDonalds like the one on 8thav bet24th  25thst"
13870,1,The  workers over there arent very smartI called at 1020am to ask what time did they stop serving breakfasthe stated that they served breakfast all day over the phone My reply was okay well what time do you all stop serving breakfast through the drive thruhis reply we stopped serving breakfast and then I was abruptly hung up 
13828,1,They have an arcade upstairs but no one working in the arcade and play area No one is available to redeem tickets for prizes Who wants to leave without their prize not my kid
6354,1,This is the worst Mcdonalds I have ever been in This place is the epitome of bad customer service They charge extra for additional ketchup do not offer free refills and a tiny portion of the dining room is open after 1 am They close off most of the dining room One time I went in to order something around 1 am but was unable to find any seating because other people were on their laptop hogging the booths and not ordering anything They were taking up space Mcdonalds staff did nothing about it when we complained about there being no seating Most Mcdonalds offers free refills on medium and large drinks but not this one One time I asked the manager for a free refill and he was very rude and dismissive This is not an ideal place to dine in at all but it is still convenient to order a coffee there though
6337,1,"ROACH ROACH ROACH 
If I had the option to give no stars at all I would I simply walked in to use the bathroom and as I was waiting at the counter a roach came out of the bottom and was running around people"
6338,1,"Why read a review of a McDonalds Because theyre not all the same The quality of food and customer service changes across stores

Slow Limited availability of basic soda Employees spent 5 minutes watching an overflowing drinks machine instead of serving customers

Worst McDonalds in the area"
6339,1,"This McDonalds security is horrible The Africa American lady talks down to people and rush you while your still within your 30 minute time limit She calls the police every 10 minutes and her mouth is reckless towards paying customers Ive never been more horrified to go to McDonalds Me  my friends eat there every day spending no less than 10 a piece They just changed to this security company and they are very very nasty to paying cuatomers She flashes her police badge to scare people away from here
This woman is very unprofessional and something needs to be done before someone gets hurt Thank you"
6340,1,DISGUSTING  thats the only way I can describe this place Its 130 am on a Saturday and my Lord not 1 but 7 people either sleeping in booths or begging for food or money and the bath room doors dont even lock Is this allowed to happen Is this how we run businesses in NY  I guess McDonalds cares about ALL of their customers no matter how unsafe they feel  They just want their money and cant get sued by someone less fortunate for being kicked out even if they havent ordered anything Good job McDs
6341,1,Two people got shot after an altercation at this McDonalds I walked past this morning and two low life thugs were bashing each other up with blood spilling over their faces Police had to restrain them The cheap low quality food produced here attracts a horrible crowd I wouldnt go here and Im looking forward to this establishment shutting down
28438,1,The diner was dirty and so was all the tables and I dont want to mention the restrooms were smelly and dirty there was two teenagers on their cell phones wasting valuable Time
13845,1,BE CAREFUL WITH THEIR CARS STEAL if you park it for 5 min They break the glass because they know that MANY TOURISTS visit it You will NEVER get your belongings back because not even the police are interested in solving the robbery ME BEING YOU I WOULD NEVER GO
13829,1,Overcrowded and rude employees when we went Overhyped in my opinion Just browse the pictures on the internet and call it good  Theres no need to visit this place Smaller jungle gym than we thought and too overcrowded with kids shoving each other and climbing over each other We wanted to try the pizza but they closed shortly after we arrived Mind you it was open when we first arrived but we had to wait in a ridiculously long line only to find out they closed while we were waiting and
13838,1,The building looked good and It had a lot of stuff but the employees didnt even know the food or how it was supposed to be made when they gave us the food we were missing have of the food they gave us a chicken sandwich with no chicken instead they had put a beef patty in it and one of the drinks was messed up in the second floor the air conditioning didnt work it was so hot in there plus employees were just standing there not doing nothing and just ignoring the mess that was there it had poor service I do not recommend very clogged and slow service too
28435,1,Extremely slow service one cashier with multiple people working slowly in the back a line up to and out the door and the drive through wrapped around the building Avoid late at night
13834,1,Had to wait 15 minutes to redeem video game tokens Long line of people waiting Ended up leaving Unacceptable Do better McDonalds
6348,1,Omg whatever compelled me to come in here aside from the fastest and courteous service ever its frequented by the worst elements of society ever Police or security needed here cause these methadonians and crack addicts are over the top not to mention least harassing patrons for money
6349,1,I went in was a monday afternoon it was FULL of drug addicts and they took over the place I believe theres a Rehabilitation Center near by and thats the reason But however I DONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE unless you order to take out
23876,1,We did not get the sauces for the chicken nuggets combos 
28432,1,Management just stands there while employees run around working
23878,1,NOT a 24hr store Either that or workers that refuse to fulfill orders
23870,1,The worker ignored me and started helping another customer in the midst of explaining to me about the new iced turtle macchiato
13803,1,We came here all the way from Hungary excited to try out a real american McDonalds Unfortunately our experience could not have been worse After over 45 minutes of waiting I got my Big Mac delivered to our table cold which I honestly would
6291,1,"Ive loved the original McChicken since it was introduced in the 80s when I was a baby
But getting that McChicken from midtown it was so bland and felt rushed
I ate it of course but still it tasted bad compared to the original McChicken"
13873,1,For being on of the biggest McDonalds in the heart of orlando they need more staff It took them about 20 mins drive through for a 10 PC nugget and fries The worker also had an attitude that I didn
6224,1,The security guy was very rude He was on his phone while I approached him and asked if it was possible to use the restroom He was rude and said that I can use only with a purchase which I agreed to I humbly asked if I can use the restroom first before I make the purchase and he raised his voice at me and said u keep asking me the same thing No humanity
13956,1,"Believe me when I say I love McDonalds but this particular restaurant is truly dreadful
Waited 30 minutes for my first and very probably last spicy chicken sandwich photo attached Youd think with taking that amout of time it would at least resemble the menu picture in some small way but no
They ALMOST managed to get some sauce in there Slightly more would have helped disguise the taste of the burnt brioche bun I ate it for 3 reasons 1 I was hungry 2 I didnt want to wait a further 30 minutes to be served up another sad burnt offering and 3 the dead eyes of the staff threatened to haunt my dreams for all eternity and I just couldnt face the soulsucking experience of trying to explain my disappointment to them when they were all clearly in their own personal hells
Take my advice if you decide to run the gauntlet of a late evening visit to this restaurant order the pasta not a burger its pretty decent if you have at least 30 minutes to wait for it Otherwise do yourself a favour and wander on to one of the many other restaurant choices in this part of iDrive Wish I had"
6226,1,Staff member made a mistake which we didnt realise until back at our hotel Returned to pickup the missing salad and drink  rude member of staff who ignored us so we went to the collect desk  that staff member ignored us too so we followed her  she told us to go to the other woman We refused and requested she deal with us We had no receipt just the ticket number  they had taken the receipt with the initial order Eventually gave in and tried to give us the original drink erm if we had been trying to con them how would we know the drink was there just sat on the side going cold Anyway don
23762,1,I placed mobile order and went to drive thru to pick up and told me to park I waited almost half an hour and my order was still incorrect Whats purpose of ordering on line if dont get it promptly

23763,1,Got my order wrong by forgetting to put the meat in the hamburger I ordered Had to drive all the way back because they don
13952,1,If I could give zero stars I would We drove 40 minutes thinking the kids would get to enjoy the play area but it was closed We even made multiple calls to the location before going to ask if the play area was open but nobody ever answered the phone We only found out after ordering and paying for food No signs and no indication on their website the play area is closed The video game card advertisement is deceptive and gave our kids 30 credits instead of 30 minutes leaving the done after only two games The first employee had no desire to fix the problem It wasnt till my wife finally complained to the manager Oh and if you
6232,1,Ive never left a review in my life but I had to for this location The security guard on staff tonight in this location was horrible to say the least The lack in customer service and decency is appalling Ive never walked into a business where the security guard is finding any issue he can to cause a scene and Ive never seen a 
6233,1,Overcharging customers with their uninformed prices then management does aid to the issue with accommodating the customer with the stated price

6236,1,This location constantly serves stale food have received hardburntovercooked sandwiches and freezer burned chicken tenders Even though it says open 24 hours Ive been told turned away at 3AM 1AM and even as early as 10PM a couple of weeks ago I had to wait an hour on food after the kiosks malfunctioned and my order disappeared in their system and the people working wouldnt even hook me up with a large fry instead of a medium after waiting so long This location just can
13950,1,I hate to even give this 1 star as this was the WORST McDs visit ever Waited 40 mins for 2 kids meals and 2 burger meals Didnt get my drink rcvd a plain patty in a bun when i ordered a qtr pounder with CHEESE meal no sauce for nuggets despite it being printed on my receipt which sauces Id ordered Got a halfas effort shamrock mcflurry instead of the shamrock shake I ordered A manager was rude and yelling at every customer to move out of the way The employees werent friendly and ignored my kiosk help request Just everyone I had to interact with was incredibly grumpy
23767,1,They never get the order right and be prepared to wait for them to fix it
23773,1,Went at 2am and they said there closed It says 24 hours  Lazy as s workers
28483,1,Slowest service ever I havent taste the food but i hope is not bad
6223,1,Terrible Patties are so thin AND overcooked I remember how McDonalds use to beand how real the burger use to taste Yall sacrificed everything about the old school taste of McDonalds forobviously a profit Never again My kids will never eat there

28496,1,1 star because I had cheese on my burger last night And I didnt ask for it Also the service was slow The workers was playing  goofing off and not working when suppose to
6205,1,This is what I encountered when I came to this location today  A trash bag wrapped around the door by the security guard to stop ppl from coming in   So instead of a safe warm location to order and pickup from I had to wait on a very dangerous Avenue in NYC while they took their sweet time in making my order  20 minutes to make breakfast and having to wait on a dangerous street is ABSOLUTELY APPALING
6206,1,They were careful about maintaining social distancing an encouraging sign  However because of the nature of the area and the poor getting poorer and the homeless getting braver several times while waiting on line to order and to pick up seemingly homelessdesperate people came in begging some pretending to order some appeared to be casing the customers  It was disturbing to say the least On top of all of that the meals I had ordered were cold and the french fries limp and cold I would never go there again
6207,1,Slow late night weekend workersespecially the female workerit seems like she doesnt wanna workhighly doubt any s
23749,1,Very poorly customer service I asked for a carmelfrapa got it with no Carmel because they didnt have any in the store I wasnt told at all I had to go inside from drive thru to find that out very unsatisfied

6242,1,Cant use restroom  without paying
28492,1,Waited 60 minutes in a drive thru the line wasnt even that big The lines at the theme parks are better

6214,1,I just purchase 2 sandwiches here today  I got a McChicken and a McDouble  Both of these used to be on the Dollar Menu  Now they are on the 1 2 3 Menu and they are 3 each  The McChicken had Mayo only on a far side and it was all over the wrapper and top of the bun  Almost NONE was in the sandwich  I ate it though but it tasted funny  The McDouble was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE  The bread was stale and hard  The meat was cold  It was a 1 out of 10 burger  It was that bad  I couldnt eat it so I threw it away  I wish I could get my money back  McDonalds is a failure at this point
6215,1,I always come here to get something quick while I work It drives me crazy when I forget to check my food before I leave the restaurant because when I get back to work the food is so old Its so sad that you have to check your food before you leave I ordered 3 McChickens They were so old and hard that I literally had to just eat the bread because I 
28491,1,Slow and the people behind me got their food first Common problem here I just order a drink and burger

24110,1,Worst customer service
24137,1,The manager was rude I waited for more than 40 minutes understanding that they were busy  but everyone who wanted to ask her was stressed  The worst customer service additionally tells me that my refund will be from 5 to 10 days since after 45 minutes waiting  It only said that there were many orders
28313,1,We waited in the drive thru for 30 minutes It was late after visiting the parks all day and they were close to our hotel I would stay clear of this disaster of a restaurant
6565,1,Poor service had to wait 1 hours for fast food place is a mess and never clean
6566,1,Food tastes like a absolute trash
24139,1,No cashiersorder takers you must use their selfservice kiosk which they have several of You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table however this wasnt the case for us The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby We were seated less than 6 feet away from her and in her lineofsight We raised our hand and said thats us She saw us but made no attempt to deliver the food I dont mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table but Im feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this pointwe placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a fullservice McDonalds charges Several people instore and in drive thru returned food due to being cold old or not made correctly This included usat 100 in the afternoon the nuggets were cold chewy and seemed old I would think this wouldnt be the case given 100 pm is during the lunch rush Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready Double cheeseburger was made correctly no mustard or pickles but bun was not warmdry and cheese was coldnot melted 4 managers were in the kitchen buttonup shirts with ties along with 6 employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shufflepaced leisurelystroll walk I worked at McDonalds and Burger King as a teenager and was always told If you got time to lean youve got time to clean and that was during slowdead times not lunch rush I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be 510 minutes for fresh ones was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one
24141,1,horrific service this is NOT the worlds largest McDonalds as people are reviewing on here this is the location on international Dr near the OCCC ordering at the drive thru took almost 20 minutes this did not include waiting for the food the man speaking kept whispering and getting an attitude despite us saying we could not hear him did not correctly take our order would just not say anything for multiple minutes at a time i have never in my life been to a McDonalds with worse service avoid at all costs
24142,1,Rude and unattentive staff   They were not even busy and I asked can I order my food at the register basically was told you have to use the kiosk and she walked away from me  Not offering any type of assistance or making you feel welcome in any way  I turned around and walked out the door
6561,1,Too crowded and not enough workers The workers are so tired that they forget orders and screams to the customers
6571,1,First time ever here and last Ive never had a fish filet taste so bad
24147,1,Rude staff  Slow food delivery  Kiosk may save the owner money but it is slow and convoluted  Not sure why you take a number for table side service and then have to go to counter to pick it up   Food quality is poor
6577,1,They messed up my order And they are slow And alot of loud mouth drug addicts was in there making noise
28305,1,Worse McDonalds Ive ever been to Twice Ive been there and both times I had to sit there and wait almost 15 mins to get my food The second time the staff was there in the kitchen taking pictures while my food was getting cold Never again
24149,1,Waited to long at drive thru while other line was moving App code for deal canceled out and I had to wait for the code to appear again Crew not helpful at drive thru or inside
6581,1,This establishment is disgusting when it comes receiving a request from the customer ant getting the customer order wrong or incomplete or not having food offered on the menus every single time its one or the other when it come to this place it cant just be me
24150,1,Staff stole 250 out of a bag that my little sister had brought absolutely devastated never go here such cheeky and careless staff I am so angry do not go to this McDonald

6560,1,Shittyy slow service
28314,1,Slowest McDonalds Ive ever visited  Checked in on a pickup order for Uber  Waited 15 minutes and they were so backed up that they hadnt even started on the order yet  Will not be returning to this location
6539,1,Wayyyyyyy to busy for me as a tourist just to get chicken nuggets for a Toddler butttttttt then again it was a Saturday night lol
28318,1,Cash only drive through after waiting 30 minutes
6542,1,Very in consistent  salad contains rotting lettuce  noone ever answers the phone to call and complain wet spots all over the floor dirty and unorganized
6543,1,The night crew is the worst slowest staff ever in the history of Shitdonalds 25mins to take orders from 5 people
6545,1,Nothing has changed with McDonalds I didnt even order food I ordered a latte and they couldnt even get my order correctly Smh
6546,1,Terrible service Not very clean place Can often feel unsafe after hours
28316,1,Building is completely locked so cant use bathroom even after waiting for curbside
24135,1,I visited this location 55 at 507 pm The 2 young ladies black and Hispanic that was handling the food was very rude and rounding their eyes when I asked for fresh fires When she handled me the fries with an attitude here you go First and last time visiting this location Smh customer service training needed asap
24120,1,This place sucks 
13603,1,Overall great place to just look just look The pizza was not the disappointment but the decision in ordering the pizza If anyone wants to eat nasty pizza I recommend buying frozen pizza It takes 30 mins to get the pizza upon ordering it It has no cheese and the toppings were underwhelming The frozen pizza in your local grocery might be a better option
6552,1,Terrible I have ordered my food and after 15 mins the security came on me saying that I should finish and leave soon because I cant occupy the chair for too long
24131,1,We were inside a Walmart McDonalds My granddaughter has food allergies to egg  dairy So there are only a few things that she can have We had ordered her a kids happy meal with apple slices but they gave us french fries instead The beef frying oil has dairy in it so she can not have the french fries and they were all out of apple slices Next we ordered apple juice They were all out of apple juice as well The girl employee that was trying to help us did not believe me that the french fries had dairy in it A happy meal hamburger and apple slices is all she can have here Was not happy with the service here The food and service times are not the same as it used to be
28315,1,the service was horrible I was very very disappointed they dont give you the right food that dont take that order correctly thenmanager I dont know why they do on their time because you ask for manager and takes forever to come and assist you I will never go there again
6555,1,Worst mc donalds ever Poor customer service and they mess up your orders  Every time
24133,1,Inside counter served all takeout orders before any dine in customers Watching customers that ordered over 10mins after myself get theirs first After getting the food the fries and Big Mac were both ever under cooked This place shouldnt even be open
6557,1,Hell nofirst if you get your food cuz the wait is ridiculous This location is a mess 
24122,1,"Disappointing McDonalds is my standby for fast food Normally I get consistent food with decent sometimes amazing service I know its not going to the gourmet but better than waiting at an untested restaurant for more expensive and worse food

Shrinkflation at its best  Half filled fries Soda with no refills Seriously Especially now that a combo meal costs 9

At first I thought it was because the restaurant was newer but after looking at these review"
24007,1,Dirty tables no lids for the cups
13687,1,"Growing up in Orlando I visited this location as a child and knew the Oerther family Decided to take my child here for her first visit and sadly was left pretty infuriated

First I timed it and it took 25 minutes for us to receive our order We had to stop and ask an employee what the hold up was When they finally brought our order out to us my daughter was missing her drink which you can clearly see on the receipt is there Tea  Lemonade I asked another employee about it he took my receipt and never came back So I had to leave my hot food and go stand at the front for a good 58 minutes just to ask a third person for the drink How hard is it just to give me a cup that I clearly didnt receive and I will just make it myself at a machine

They gave me a card to come back for a free meal and apologized but it was beyond frustrating for a 25 McDonalds meal

The peanut butter cake was delicious and it looks like the ack in service"
13691,1,"Its a great location if you want to wait 30 minutes for extremely subpar food Fries are stale food is bland as hell and in pretty sure there is mold on one of my sandwiches

Also come here so the kid could burn off energy but the playplace was closed

Annnyyyyyways Probably wont return"
6412,1,Worst mc Donald in America They have lots homeless people inside the place very dirty not well coordinated even thought its in a good location for business The management have to do something about it
23926,1,Not good waited to long for food and then the order was wrong
28400,1,Ordered a regular big mac with large fries They gave me the Bigmac Bacon it was cold Fries were cold
6416,1,Too many homeless people in this establishment cant enjoy a meal without being bothered by one
6417,1,Theyre not open right now take the lady j
28394,1,Very dirty  Cold food  Somebody peed in the play area  Management was informed but nobody cleaned it up
13765,1,"Where should I start Service was exceptional BAD I was missing half of my order and had to go down stairs and bring the rest of my order they was missing back upstairs which was alot of hassle to do Also wouldve been very helpful if there was a refill station upstairs

The atmosphere was way too overcrowded I dont really fault McDonalds for this but it didnt make the experience pleasant

Overall I would skip this place if I see a parking lot full of cars"
6410,1,Horrible service They got my order wrong so many times like i order a customize sandwich and they made it with things i said no tosmh the mc donalds is very humid like there is no working air condioning
13764,1,The biggest waste of time and money Way to packed Unorganized There was barely a line when we got to McDonalds yet we still waited over an hour for 2 bacon mcdoubles a big Mac a bacon chicken ranch they forgot the bacon when its literally IN THE TITLE and 4 medium fries Everything and I mean EVERYTHING was cold and disgusting Spent way more money than it should have been Will NOT be going back there The kids didnt even want to play in the play area because they ended up getting hurt Poorly set up and no security or anything They were being pushed and shoved by other children and no one was doing anything about it
6423,1,This McDonalds does not support the troops
6424,1,The service was terrible They only focused on food orders and drink orders were left behind the counter piling up and untouched
6425,1,Kia machine you pay for your order and then you wait about 1520 minutes before the McDonald people give you your order you ordered sits up there and wait until the McDonald staff person give you your food great great modern technology
6426,1,My mobile order was missing and the crew refused to help They said there
6427,1,dirty placenot hygienicstaff don t take correcty order prefers talking with other people aroundone cashier opened for more ten people waiting and boss opened a cashier especially for his friend and close itand leftso no respect for the customers and not fair at all finally a place to avoid
6429,1,Bad service Food got me sick This is day 4 and I
6430,1,The new layouttechnology is a disaster Rough crowd  most just hanging around and not eating  Left with my meal due to the number of times I was solicited for cash and food  Wouldnt hurry back
6422,1,Female patrons enter this McDonalds at your own risk There is a female heroin addict hanging in the females bathroom trying to assault and Rob female patrons in the womens bathroom I advise you to not go to that mcdonalds
13759,1,"With a 6 year old we visit McDonalds every so oftenthis place was just awful

Ordered 20 regular mcnuggets a large fries couple drinks and a happy meal

45 min wait  17 spicy nuggets in the boxes no sauces despite the machine asking what sauces we want Drinks are just cups despite the machine asking what we want  self service downstairs with no instructions on how to get the milkshake we ordered as only soda fountains at the stations etc

Nuggets were over cooked Like properly crunchyjerky texture

Fries were literally stone cold not even warm

Our kid loved the play centre but this isnt worth paying twice the price of a regular McDonalds for just plain terrible food and no service at all"
6408,1,This McDonalds Im not sorry to say is full of homeless people begging while people are standing in line with their families ordering Also drug addicts in the bathroom using drugs while customers are waiting to use it Very poor upkeep of this location
6406,1,this is my 2nd order Uber is great but my drinks were not delivered I did not say anything the first time but it happened again and when I tried to call the phone is not in service
13795,1,This was a horrible experience and a waste of 4 hours and almost 100 The place was terribly overcrowded and dirty There was standing room only shoulder to shoulder We stood in line for 20 minutes at a kiosk to order then after we ordered it said there was an error and we had to wait another 40 minutes in the line at the register anyway to order All of the workers were super rude I was even on the elevator with 2 workers talking about a customer saying I have no obligation to answer your questions or do anything for these people and then talking about how gross a customer was and saying she would point her out to the other employee Nobody was at all helpful and even seemed to be angry when we asked for anything  My daughter tried to fill her cup with sweet tea and the older lady standing at the drink station didnt let her fill it up all the way The only nice person was the old guy emptying the trash on the 2nd floor We spent over 60 for my kids to play the arcade games then they shut and locked the prize counter A while later we had to ask someone to open it so they could redeem their tickets and 3 employees tried over the course of the next hour and no one could get it back open I tried talking to a manager about it but she gave me about 10 seconds of her time just to tell me there was nothing she could do but send someone up to the ticket counter for us she didnt even listen to us explain that it others had tried before she just walked away We are from out of state and my kids were so excited to see this place but we all left miserable At least the sandwiches were warm though the fries were soggy
13794,1,Fries were cold nuggets were soft the burgers were gross the upstairs smelled sweaty and gross ordered food and the place was busy and my child needed to use the bathroom so I took the card with our number to the bathroom because I didnt want them leaving my food alone at the table and they came over and yelled at us for moving around the mcdonalds honestly 110 do not recommend It is not worth it Go find a  regular McDonalds and a park close by
13793,1,Absolute free for all inside A automated factory that completely doesnt work People waiting over 45 min for their food nearly every order was wrong and staff just literally ignoring the countless customers complaining The manager had no control over his staff who blatantly ignored him to the point he was telling customers their names to report This place simply doesnt work and is utter chaos 40 almost an hour and wrong food with no one to care
23904,1,Save yourself the trouble
23905,1,Always somethi wrong with my food I hot a soda instead of juice and my food was cold
13787,1,Worst McDonalds experience I have had in all my life Place was chaotic from the moment we walked in but for some reason that didnt put us off Waited for ages to receive our food and when it did arrive half of it wasnt there and some of it was cold Tried to find a helpful member of staff  were still looking Went to get some drinks all of which were horrible as quoted by another customer even the water tasted like sewage We ended up leaving with what we had and wondering how long the symptoms of cholera take to set in So safe to say we wouldnt recommend and would 100 not return Horrible
6392,1,Regular Macdonalds but it was forbidden to finein even though many restaurants are reopening their indoor spaces and it was also impossible to go to the restrooms
13774,1,My friends and I decided to visit the worlds largest McDonalds tonight while on our holiday to Orlando The visit was absolutely abysmal We got table service which took over 35 minutes to come 3 drinks a cheese burger and McNuggets and once we received our order only  of it was there When we ask staff about the rest of our order they just walked away and were no help at all So I went to the front desk and had to wait for a further 10 minutes to be seen I eventually got the rest of the order but by which time the food was now cold By far the worst experie
13784,1,1010 not recommended Waited for our food for over 45 minutes Didnt even receive what we ordered Parking is a nightmare not worth it just because they have pizza You c
13783,1,Our Worlds Biggest McDonalds adventure started with an appetizeran appetizer consisting of the smile and excitement of my McDonalds loving younger brother Then came the 1st coursethe tears of my girlfriend as she gazed upon her small serving of 12 pasta while her fingers felt the stone cold chill of her fries Our meal ended with the return of my absolutely revolting Chicken Alfredo which led the the main course of a Big Maca Big Mac has never failed me until today With the measliest of beef patties and sauce on the side yes they missed the burger I was astonished by the lack of quality this McDonalds provided Also my brothers Pizza took an hour to be served and then he was argued with 110 would not recommend fire everybody
6398,1,They charged a price to replace coffee with orange juice in the breakfast thats almost the price to just buy a separate juice didnt notify me and gave me someone elses receipt when I asked for it When I came back in 5 minutes to buy the 199 2burritos I only got one and she refused to give me the receipt
6399,1,"I would never go  back  there
It  was dirty and saw several drug deals while eating my food
Never Again"
28402,1,"The bread is cold meat are dry bad taste 
Ruin Mc Donald"
13781,1,Worst place to visit My kids love McDonalds so we wanted to try the largest McDonalds This was the worse idea ever We waited over an hour to get our food The food was wrong We ha
6402,1,I wont be visiting my local MacDonalds again after finding out about the awful conditions that their chickens endure They are bread to grow so large that they are crippled under their own weight and live a life of pain and suffering ImNotLovinIt
6403,1,Your staff put their hands on me while their friends are late night In McDonald
6395,1,STOP EATING MCDONALDSPERIOD
23747,1,It says theyre open 247 but when I got to the drive through at 1 am they said theyre closed
13758,1,Unfortunately its not got any better The first time visiting this trip and they got my order wrong I didnt have much faith to begin with to be honest The attention to detail here is lacking And 5 for a latte is unreal Tourist trap central Cross the road to checkers and get good food at a low price
28390,1,TerribleAn Employee name Andrea has the worse Customer service ever My order was wrong and they still was giving me a hard time to fix itBAD SERVICE
6462,1,At one time this was the best place to eat I eat here often years ago just came to see what has change and I can say its the worst while its clean not a good or safe place to be any more
6464,1,Worst McDonalds Ive ever been to Just awful customer service We did go in after 10pm but it took 20 minutes to get the meal Staff were busy joking around and messed up so many peoples orders
13716,1,Nope just nope Stay away Not worth your sanity at all First its packed So very packed When I went the game room up stairs with the huge play ground the air wasnt working half of the games were broken they are so short staffed there is no employee to redeem your tickets The play area wasnt well cleaned at all and the bathrooms werent kept up Im sure do to the fact they are so very busy and short staffed The pizza was good and the peanut butter cake was good But not worth the hype especially with all the craziness that was going among many other issues
28374,1,Took 29 minutes in the drive thru for 2 McDoubles and a happy meal At 7pm
13712,1,One of the worst McDonalds Ive ev
28373,1,Bad experience taking too long with the orders
28372,1,My son got a vanilla shake there it didnt look right it was soupy he tasted it and his stomach was upset all that day
13723,1,This location fed me raw chicken I ordered spaghetti with McCrispy and half way through the McCrispy it turns out raw
23975,1,Horrible most likely not stopping by this location again
6474,1,"Dirty and unkempt Limited staff around so tables not cleaned
Seems to be a popular place for the homeless to visit"
6475,1,Very poor management if they be open at the time they say theyre supposed to open it says 24 hours and I was hoping to stop by and get a quick breakfast before going to work but then they are closed but why even say youre open 24 hours if youre closed not only that there are always homeless people infested at the doors here so I wouldnt recommend anyone going here
23990,1,Probably the worst McDonalds Ive ever been in
28367,1,Tried 3 of the kiosk to order my food Never completed an order on a kiosk something different wasnt available on each one Busy as hell took a long time to get my food Never again
6478,1,We went at 2am and even though there were less than 5 other people in the restaurant we waited 25 minutes for our food with no explanation Food was fine but the wait was horrible
28366,1,Manager doesnt know how to put his name tag on right side up How can he run a restaurant
23993,1,Ice cream machine broken on the 4th of july
28370,1,Increible how the drivethru work here waiting the outside line more than 5 mins and see how the inside lo e pass 7 cars already unacceptable
28391,1,Me and my family were there at 1015 pm on a Sunday and they would not let us inwe were not happy at allwat to soon to be locking doors
6460,1,Dirty on the inside Tables were filthy Typical McDonalds with all types of sketchy people roaming it Dangerous as well due to the drug induced people inside causing  commotion
28380,1,It was a crappy McDonalds They lie about their hours I went around 930 for food and they were closed When they clearly say that they are 24hours Dont waste your time with this place Worst McDonalds ever
23948,1,Food is yucky greasy fake but  if you get the fries wo salt you have a  winner
28387,1,Slow service And we were the only ones in there  Found hair in my food If I could give no stars I would never comming back
6441,1,This place does not have any regard for their kiosk orders
6442,1,First day in NY Maybe things are different here but the experience was terrible
28386,1,Terrible service Left the drive thru after barely moving for 10 minutes Not prepared for late night customers
13742,1,The Worlds Largest McDonalds turns out to also be the worlds noisiest Aside from the fact that 1 our order wasnt fully delivered to our table and 2 our order was wrong the 2nd floor is a chaotic thrum of children
23951,1,Bread was  hard meet was cold looks like a old sandwich
23959,1,Unprofessional staff and clearly showing poor care about customers
28384,1,If I could give it zero stars I would we went here 3 times recently and they mess up every time and they are just rude people I would recommend staying away from this location theres a checkers across the street I would recommend over them
6450,1,Too Many drugdealershomeless people standing in front of the store and inside the store The staffs are very rude and sanitation is below average
28383,1,Gave order in the drive thru lady wasnt paying attention on what I wanted mind you I only ordered 3 things had to repeat myself 3 more times at the window then they still get my order wrong never again
13735,1,We waited 50min for 3 burgers and 4 chicken nuggets   Everything was cold  I asked for hot food so they put everything in the trash and I waited another 7min to get my order  1h00 to have my order in this Fast Food  No one apologized  I do not recommend going there if you are in a hurry  All the tables around us waited at least 40min
6453,1,avoid going in the morning before 7 am you cannot even go in or out of the door with out stomping into a homeless person  cashiers not ready and mobile order system down cannot even get my order and the workers walk around like you dont even exist in the line
23956,1,I always have problems with my food
28381,1,Tortillas stale and why ask if I want sauce if you arent going to give any Lol
6456,1,Dirty Strange people inside
6449,1,"This location is a dangerous place with a dark history Avoid it if you can If you decide to go keep your wallet and pocket book close and stay alert
They have a makeshift memorial on one of the tables with candles and flowers"
23746,1,Says 1020 minute delivery yet for the past year it
28499,1,Rude managers profiled me Had my life threaten by Corp Worst fast food ever
28500,1,Poor costumer service  Slow and cold food  The manager didnt care about my order had me waiting for over 30 minutes
28662,1,3 times asked for sauce for nuggets got home no sauce
28661,1,Bad service  Im very disappointed this place has awful customer service 
5950,1,From a disabled stand point this would not be an ideal dining experience  There isnt any designated areas for wheelchair customers Staff are not equipped to handle a wheelchair customers The one area where someone with a wheelchair chair could sit is next to the entrance the bathroom and the order kiscos and quite popular waiting area set up for customers waiting for their order
14162,1,I like the food here but I can not stand that manager Franklin Ive gotten a degree in psychology and he displays so many abusive traits He was so badgering to a few of his workers Also a male and female worker were hugging and being unprofessional I could only read the females name tag and it was Stacy Please be careful with who you promote as manager I wont come back unless I hear about a change in management
5952,1,On May 62018  I ordered my coffee by using online app at 630 am  I went to this location to pick up my order at 645 am  and then one employee at cashier who did not want to give me my order  because he didnt see it on screen  I showed him see my online receipt include the number of order that I paid it by using my bank account  I asked him to help me to check on the system for make sure  but he did not want to help me  After waited for 5 mins it showed off on the screen
14161,1,Not to be mean but Id say this is Probably up there with one of the top 5 worst McDonalds Ive gone to and I find that funny because its a McDonalds my standards really are not that high I
14160,1,Just had the worst meal Fries were limp and very cold Chicken nuggets tasted like cardboard my kids wouldnt even eat them The lettuce on my chicken sandwich was unrecognizable and brown Utterly disgusted doesnt even cover it
28657,1,Order food here and wait 30 mins for your order no fast food here
14159,1,Not only does this location routinely forget items we paid for tonight they served us a RAW burger and also forgot food and I
14158,1,This McDonalds is a hot mess   I live near it and regret coming here every time I do    Always out of something or a machine is down     Tonight I sat in the drive through for 15 min just sitting here watch the drive thru guy freak out over his computer not workingonly to be told a machine is out   Get it together
23627,1,I came here at around 11pm last night I ordered a spicy mcchicken medium meal 2 cheeseburgers and I asked for the fries fresh I usually never have an issue when I go to other McDonalds I order the same thing Well its not fresh its called to order I had to wait  no issues with that if you want fresh food you typically have to wait for it to be made  I got my food 8 minutes later and drove off so I could get the food to the house Almost home I look in the bag and grab a fry because mcdonalds fries fresh are freaking delicious Yeah no I bit 5 fries all at once and they were soggy and unsalted Highly disappointed I tried to call and the phone just rang I was no longer close to the mcdonalds so I just ordered the same thing at another mcdonalds closer to my destination in winter park They actually gave me a discount and apologized for my troubles at this mcdonalds They said they understood I wont be coming back to this mcdonalds
23628,1,The worst place to eat Go there only if you have 3 hours of leisure time  you dont mind waiting 45 minutes to an hr to be taken care of Only one manager  too many rookies are uncapable too supply the high demand
14155,1,Why would you ask me when im ordering if i want any condiment if ur just going to forget them Fries are raw and my sandwich patty was hard but yet they still some how managed to smush the sandwich in half Atlest they wore able to get the drink right
5961,1,"THERES NO CODE FOR THE BATHROOM Just walk up to the second floor

Horrible customer service rudest people ever"
14154,1,Just trash service just waited 40 minutes in a drive thru after paying just walk in and grab my own food and barely get a im sorry they tried to bring me the wrong order took my receipt and NEVER came back I walked in to get my own food  Absolute worst experience ordering food in a drive thru NEVER AGAIN
14163,1,The staff was slow getting orders out that were taken in the lobby and they got at least 3 peoples orders wrong while I was there waiting for my 2 breakfast combo for literally 15 minutes
5946,1,While the map said that this place is open 24 hours we came to find the doors locked with a bunch of people casually hanging outeatingdrinking inside at 1am The staff told us theyre closed even though they were not supposed to be
14164,1,Fries were cold and I ordered a Large size 280tax that was only filled half way I asked them if they could please fill them up and she literally put just a few more on top and when I stood it up it was just a little over half way now They wouldnt even pass the edge of the front part When I showed it to her she got annoyed and closed the window Very rude employees
14165,1,I get about half a box of fries every time i go Its really frustrating how stingy they can be with french fries I order a large and get less than a small Also Im very upset with the price changes of already overpriced trash
5927,1,Beware they are not 24 hours Ive stopped here several time in the early am hours and the door was locked The workers were inside and wouldnt even come to the door They yelled 6 oclock So much for 24 hours When it is open it surrounded by homeless people inside and out They might as well turn it into a homeless shelter
14177,1,I ordered a double quarter pounder with cheese meal the fries were good but I took one bit out of the burger only to discover the patties were not fully cooked
14176,1,"I have been here a handful of times as I live in the area every single time the food is old and cold Drive to the RIM if you have time I keep trying again bc the location is convenient but never again
I will say the servers are very nice but what you"
5930,1,I ordered a 6 piece chicken nuggets and when I get to my room I open the box to only find 4 They rip you off check before you leave Also employees may follow you outside while saying insults towards you even if you patiently wait
28675,1,Not only was the speed of service poor I waited in line for just under 20 mins to receive my food thrown inside of a bag I did not eat either the 14 pounder or the nuggets They really need to shut this restaurant down because for the love of god they dont hire decent staff this has been going on for years Im not eating food with strands of hair or food thats hanging out of a bag such ill preparation
14175,1,Stop Abort Do not drive thru No liewe got there and there was a line One car at the speaker another car and then us Many cars came after us 25 minutes we got to the speaker We were trapped in line By that time one of us went inside placed our order and came back just after we reached the speaker We were seriously going to go over the curb thru the lava rocks and leave when the 3 cars behind us started backing out Not even exaggerating There were 7 cars behind us 5 in front of us Never has a McDonalds been this slow
5933,1,The cashier successfully scammed my change Well I guess she needed the money It is not about the meager change but the idea that they would scam a paying customer I will never come back here ever again worst experience ever
5963,1,Its hard to give them any stars because we didnt get to eat there For what is advertised as open 24 hrs they were closed all 3 x I tried to go there this weekend  Very dissatisfied
5934,1,Awful place to visit in ugly new York City waste of time
5936,1,They was so unpleasant at pickup
23623,1,Today visit was the worse  Other stops they forgot things or wrong in my orders forgetting hashbrowns  wrong  items drinks made wrong But today it took the cake The work took a couple of minutes to take are order  Then when we got are order my wife check it all the items where there  But only 2 ideam that where right was the hash browns and a sweet tea  Order a 3  Bacon egg and cheese biscuit or hash Browns and sweet tea 2nd order was a sausage egg mcmuffin with a hot chocolate We got a sausage muffin with cheese and a sausage muffin with a hot chocolate that my wife said it was not drinkable  If you ask why didnt we take it back  We dont have time drop the wife off at work then i get on the road to go to work  Dont think we be going back to this McDonalds its becoming more of a disappointment then a enjoyment
14172,1,"Was not very impressed with this location service was awful 2 people in line ahead of me wife used restroom took my place in line I used the restroom came back waited close to ten more minutes for our order to be taken mind you only three customers we ordered two 20 piece nuggets frys and drinks CHECK YOUR ORDERS HERE We got a fish sandwichfry and a big mc ours was not only order messed up they had perfect scores 3for3 wrong then when we dig get the nuggets they were still frozen inside and had to take them back staff just want to draw a paycheck but not do anything and have how dare you attitude when you bring things to their attention never did get my food finally had enough and walked out

I will make this "
14170,1,It doesnt seem to matter what time of the day you go here it is always going to be a 1520 minute wait to get your food and that is after you have ordered Its another 510 minutes to wait to order It seems that they focus solely on the drivethru versus the counter
23625,1,I felt really sick after eating the fish fillet sandwich They made me wait a long time at curbside for my sandwich and fries I assumed it will all be fresh How wrong was I Disgusting sandwich and stale fries Never returning to this location again
23626,1,I ordered a kids meal that took 14 minutes to receive  they claim hash browns are not a lunch time item even though its on the all day breakfast menu claiming it took 12 minutes to cook a hash brown worst location ever
14166,1,Just left  was hu gry  got home and my quarter pounder is raw  The nuggets were old and cold  really Had tojust throw out and make a sandwich  My 6 year old wasnt happy  she wants all week for her nuggets  She gets a 6 piece and shares the 20bpiece with me
14174,1,When I was there a manager named Franklin was very unhelpful and rude and I wish I could just give him 0 stars He was even humiliating his workers As a person of virtue I can not allow this to go unnoticed All other services was ok but it was just the manager who was the problem at this establishment
14152,1,Friday night 1045 pm Dining room still closed There are about 67 cars in line behind the person who just ordered when an employee comes out and tells us SORRY WE STOPPED TAKING ORDERS BECAUSE WE CLOSE AT 11
14151,1,This is the 3rd time in a month that we have ordered food from this store and have not received even close to what we have ordered Would avoid this location at all cost from here on out Continually going down hill and poor and slow service
23630,1,Terrible service Charged me 798 for 2 snack size McFlurries when that is the price for 2 regular size Asked for a meal and only gave me the burger Full of dumb people that can
14138,1,"Food tastes gross been eating healthy too long figured I would try them out it has been probably 10 years since I had McDonalds chicken products It was either old or they figured out how to Nuke girl Chicken in about 30 seconds either way slightly concerning LOL

this is only a review of the food quality the service at this location seem great and if we could rate businesses categorically then they would have received five stars for customer service and speed"
23637,1,Miyra is extremely rude and slow Acts like she hates her job Took 30 minutes to get an egg McMuffin and hash brown
5992,1,Place used to be great Now they have beggars  the homeless have taken over almost the entire 2nd floor Place smells horrid The employees are rude food takes so long
28628,1,Terrible restaurant very dirty I do not understand how Mac DOnal let have this disgusting restaurant
14134,1,Went through the drivethrough and at 1059am was told only serving breakfast and that Id have to circle back around to the back of the line since lunch doesnt start until 1100am
5995,1,Very bad service even when its slow The machines never work
23638,1,Horrible McDonalds I had visited this McDonalds in the late evening and I was getting cussed out by a employee mopping the floor How would I supposed to know what area are you mopping without a sign or just tell me politely to watch my step I wouldve kept coming to this McDonalds but if someone is mopping the floor and cussing customers out for walking on the wet floor needs to be fired
14139,1,Update  If I could give this location zero stars I would I have given them multiple chances and every time it just gets worse  Do not mobile order and expect it to be timely nor correct Do not expect any friendly customer service here from anyone including the managers They all need a lesson in management and customer service
5998,1,"Do not eat from hereif you do shame on youbut take it homedont even eat inside this mcdonald
Ive never seen a mcdonald homelesa shelter thats right i said ithow can you eat if theres homeless people camping out upstairs in the dining area like its their home  And btw it reeks of piss upstairs too"
23640,1,Today at approximately 220 I asked for a happy meal and asked for the extra french fries in the order and the lady of the dri thru told me give it to me  give it to me now in a high tone of voice give me the bag and I pack very reluctantly she was really rude at the time of serving me simply for asking for some fries now if you could give me a feedback because it really is not the way to serve the customer
14130,1,Tried their new Crispy Chicken sandwich Came wirh pickles only no mayo or any other condiments And the guy on the intercom couldnt talk articultely ie as if he was on drugs or half asleep
14128,1,The McDonalds at Fair Oaks has got to be the slowest location with the rudest people Seriously there are two other locations in either direction  at the Rim and in Boerne so go to one of those unless you love to wait forever for subpar lukewarm food andor be slapped around with someones bad attitude
28624,1,Service very slow on all 3 visits and they get the order wrong  Very very poor
14127,1,"This location refuses to serve truck drivers
Tried to walk through the drive thru but was told that they couldnt serve me if I wasnt in a car
Sounds like discrimination against oversized vehicles to me
If they can get sued for burning someone with hot coffee you better believe ill have a suit filed before Monday"
6006,1,All Employee not polite and they not speaking English so rude to costumer Manager and gm are not help for costumer
6007,1,Popped in for a drink to pass some time between appointments and charge my phone Nothing works and homeless people were skattered everywhere eating ketchup packets Pass
5999,1,Its a sad state of affairs when you buy an ice cream sundae to get access to the McDonalds bathroom and not only is the sundae prepared wrong the hot fudge isnt supposed to just get dumped on top of the ice cream thats gotta be like day 1 of McDonalds training but the bathroom clearly hasnt been cleaned in weeks
23622,1,yall need to step it work I know its stressful but ppl at the window need to look in the bag know its the right thing and repeat it back  Im happy I dont work there nor do I ever want to if I had to but everytime our order is wrong  and you pay for not what you get its sad we cant afford to pay for sonthing we want and get ripped off lets do better guys if you dont like ur job or have an additide towards ppl just leave it at home or find another job 
5987,1,I gave this a one star just because it doesnt have zero star not sure how this place have a 3 star i will never step in there again the most nasty place ever first time going to china town and had to really used the br but also wanted food thank god i used the rest room first that place looked like hasnt been cleaned in years i bet rats leaves there after that i cant picture how their food is not sure how this is still open People before you order dnt look at the Br yall will regret eating
28638,1,always making mistakes and errors with orders or dont have the employees to service customers
28652,1,Worst place ever very bad customer serviceif i could put  stars i would
23631,1,Worst McDonalds in the area After waiting in line over 20 minutes I finally get to the window for them to inform me that they were closed Mind you this was at 112 am Saturday morning The store hours for this location reads closes at 3 am not 112 am Clearly management didnt want to serve any more customers due to high volume not because they were closed or closing Will never go back to this location
28650,1,The manager was really mean with the employeeif them have a problem with the employee they must take them to the back
14148,1,"You all need to step up the game My order is almost always wrong especially the kids meals for some reasonjust like todayI asked for apples and of course didnt get them Shocker
Girl at the 1st window in a camo jacket was rude and generally unhappy sounding
Terrible
Updatewe ALSO got a toy in the happy meal with a coupon for a ticket to six flags that expired in 2017"
5971,1,I was forced to buy something just because I had to use the restroom SMH I understand that some business do that but really  No thank you plus manager was rushing everyone
23632,1,I live close so I frequent this location They almost always get my very simple order wrong and they cant even use the most basic forms of respect such as speaking to a customer They just take the card hand it backmost of the times without the receipt and at the next window hand you your incorrect order without so much as a word Head a few miles down A1A and get much better service with a friendlier staff
28645,1,Fries were cold and they did not like the fact I asked for fresh ones
23635,1,This has been one of the worst McDonalds I have been too Not only where the to drive through lines extremely long but then when we get to the window the person was confused with our order We drive up to get our food and the person was pleasant enough The food now left a lot to be desired French fries were not fresh They had zero salt We ordered a 10 piece of chicken nuggets and got eight pieces Then on top of that theyre old and stale and cold Needless to say we will never be going there again
14146,1,Manager was very rude and unprofessional staff was disrupted by her disrespect for customers She was in too much of a rush to speed cars along that i was unable to purchase more food Bad business practice in my opinion DT 1130 am Thursday June25
5976,1,"The worst McDonalds ever in the worldHaving already spended 12 dollars in coffees i was waiting for a friend for foodThe manager insulted me and told me to go outside because i wasnt consuming My friend came at that time so he made us the favour to let us eat there
We spended 50 more dollars and after 1 hour he told us to go out again because you can eat only 30 minutesThe whole time the shop was half emptyAt the next table a guy was eating duck from home having only a coka cola and no one told him anythingDONT GO THERE"
5978,1,Its cleanbut they dont have fountain drinks only bottles which is a ripoff I dont like this one
5979,1,Never gave me the drinks I ordered Gave me the wrong ones and never bothered to rectify my complaint Very disorganized The woman who I complained to was very bad mannered didnt have good customer service skills
28642,1,Dirty place very unclean and big wait for cold food
5982,1,when I was here it was during a rainstorm and the inside was very wet and dirty It was also very crowded as a lot of tourists and other people come here to try to use the bathroom for free It was impossible to find a place to sit to eat my snack
14143,1,Ordered food at 820 got there at 830 put my parking number into the app made sure it was the right location waited 30 minutes No food went in mad because Ive been waiting they tell me that my order was never in the system I showed them the app showing that it was this location and that the order was placed I placed an online order yesterday and with th
23633,1,The last in a string of bad experiences I only received half my order and it was still wrong Genuinely impressive how almost every experience at this location is terrible Wont be returning
5975,1,This garbage for 391 imagine
28677,1,Attention owner do you even care Worst drivethrough in all of Florida S L O W Fire everyone including your manager you got the 3 stooges working in there It is NEVER okay to sit in a drive thru for 20 minutes Get it together or close your doors
14180,1,Slowest service ever Didnt realize fast food took 45 minutes If we werent stuck in a line we should have exited a long time ago
28678,1,Cant change mobile order once placed I wanted light chocolate in my coffee instead of 6 obese size pumps that drowns the actual taste of coffee and makes it taste extremely sweet Asked at speaker window 1 window 2 and the person that made it Cant do it And they forgot the hot sauce to my burrito But this is McDonalds standard
28716,1,Seriously this place is gone to the dogs Imagine sitting in line at a fast food restaurant for over 25 minutes to get a burger and fries Only to receive said Burger and half of the large fry you ordered Cold limp fries inside of a large container which could have easily fit in a medium container Im so sick of these restaurants Fast food is no longer fast food the service is subpar and the food is not even as advertised Im literally getting jipped on my food while also waiting for almost 30 minutes to get it
5859,1,The supervisor and manager there was very rude to me and my friends this morning I treated them to coffee there they treated us as if we were homeless and rushed us outsaying there is only a 20 minute wait But had no sign in sight stating that I started to buy something else but instead Il just pray for them instead we just left I would never spend anything else there at that location
28715,1,Very slow customer service 2nd day in a row that they are out of orange juice Not up to standards
5861,1,I know its hard to work in the service industry but they seem to need education about customers  Because looking at his tone and actions he felt like he was forced to work even though he didnt want to work  Customers must continue to keep this store open and keep their jobs
5863,1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE FOOD DRY NUGGETS NOT FRESH FRIES COLD PULLED UP AND WAITED 15 MINUTES FOR FRESH NUGGETS IM STILL IN LINE WAITING
14213,1,Bad service i know we go in to this pandemic and it is rug timeswe need to be aware that there is people traveling and one stop for food be more polite to costumers dont make us fill bad for our food we are working and try to help busyness dont be rude to us
5865,1,The service of a terrible McDonalds is so bad that I can only call her that Im not racist but when I meet this kind of executive manager I think the executives of this company will come out to manage it and never go again
5857,1,Unless theyve changed their preparation process our burgers should not be this undercooked Kiosk ordering is limiting
5866,1,the attention in this place is horrible  the serving staff is really rude and unfriendly  I do not recommend going to this branch of mc donald  Your experience will be stressful
28712,1,1217 Late Saturday and No one is working at this McDonalds  Its supposed to be 24 hours  Poorly managed like most McDonalds  GM should be canned
14211,1,I went to McDonalds for only a drink 33016  940 pm and the young guy at the drive thru was a TOTAL JERK I wasnt even being mean or anything just wanted a drink In a one minute conversation he was so rude I told him what an a hole he was being and drove away Another reason why I dont go to McDonalds at I10Leon Spring
23610,1,I never ever go here because its the most incompetent McDonalds Ive ever seen operate I ran the drive thru in NYC when I was 17 so I know a thing or two about the process and how its really not rocket science but somehow they cant ever get it right Unfortunately for me my husband picked up dinner for me from there and I very Unfortunately didnt specify which one to go to although this one is closest to home I will drive all the way to Altamonte to avoid it and the way gas prices are that should tell you all you all need to know Tonight it was missing fries we ordered a total of 6 whole items so I can see how that was overwhelming to this bunch and freezing cold fries which I have no idea how you can even do since even if it been under the warmer for a while stone cold fries I wouldnt put it past them they kept them on a counter somewhere instead though And on top of that I made the mistake of asking for extra pickles on my big mac which Im sure put this kitchen in a frenzy so they just threw all the ingredients in the box so I can do my own assembling of it which was probably for the best because who knows what chaos it would cause for them to assemble it I would be embarrassed to own this place Dont go here I know its fast food and we shouldnt expect much but Altamonte Mcds never dissapoints Trust me its worth the drive
14207,1,"They are always closed and no sweet tea after 10pmand they always say due to maintenance issuesif your having problems just close up
I wont be back"
28709,1,Not only does this location take forever to give you the wrong food they also give you undercooked food We had to wait over 10 minutes for our order and this chicken sandwich was still pink
5873,1,"I dont expect much when I visit a McDonalds but this location certainly is one of the worst Ive visited in the city
The employees are incredibly rude the failed to get either of my orders correct and there seems to be a consistent encampment of homeless near the entrance that the staff dont seem to care about"
14206,1,This location is ALWAYS slow My order is constantly wrong The line takes FOREVER Avoid and go some place else
28713,1,I have never seen such a slow mc donasl in my life
5876,1,This place smells HORRIBLE I bought french fries with hot tea OMG couldnt eat the french fries bec

5849,1,Stopped for some food and a bathroom break after being on the road for 8 hours After I got back from the bathroom it was my girlfriends turn and they refused to allow her until I began raising my voice Its not closed I just went I said  Customers only they tried telling me  so I showed them my unopened food and said give me my money back for this  then They let her use the BR Apparently they play games with the bathroom because theres so many homeless people around One even asked me for money inside the mcdonalds as we were leaving
23606,1,Im not one to just say only something negative but for the life of me I cant find anything positive This branch is the slowest I have ever been to  It never gets my order right  no matter how simple I made it The burgers condiments were all wrong  The frys were old as hell and the unsweet tea tasted old and sour  Definitely no going there again no matter how desperate

14217,1,Just picked up my order of a basket of fries 
14221,1,girl at cash register taking orders did not know how to do anything let alone help customers she said next  so I walk up to the register told her what i wanted and she walk off then helped a person that walk up to counter then walk back to the register and said next customer when I was standing right in front of her and never said sorry for at what can I get you somebody needs to train better
14126,1,Check your order We live nearby and so its very convenient Unfortunately we cant rely on them getting the order correct and its not worth the hassle of going back in and waiting for the thing they forgot Once we got a Happy Meal with no nuggets next time it was a combo with no fries and then a combo with no burger Were done Not worth the hassle This isnt a McDonalds issue its just this location
28708,1,Slowest drive thru ever Takes over 30 minutes for anything
14204,1,Almost bit into this bug Come on McDonalds really
14188,1,This is the worst establishment Ive ever been in Everyone is scrambling around like they are doing something yet nothing is getting done Stood at the counter for about 8 minutes and no one took my order or even acknowledged me for that matter HORRIBLE
23617,1,Very unsatisfied order was wrong Management correct my order Just gave me an extra fry and dismissed me Will not be returning My money is just as good at burger King I understand that you are shorthanded but that should never compromise customer service
28690,1,I hate this McDonalds in the morning The drive through workers are undertrained and snappy  there is a difference between a sausage egg mcmuffin and a sausage mcmuffin I was overcharged the manager Tim had me pull up for whatever reason  I assumed for my overcharge and never came out the door I go in after 15 minutes and he acts unresponsive to the guy calling his name thats how I know what it is very unprofessional and I will be reaching out to their corporate headquarters about this matter
23618,1,When I approached the window the gentleman cashier just looked at me I said Hello and he did not speak I handed him my card and he took it as if he were frustrated When he handed the card back to me I said Thank you and he said nothing back Im not one to usually make a big deal about things I try not to be that person however the way he acted was so unnecessary Maybe I reminded him of someone I do not know and never will know I just refuse to go to this location again 
23619,1,Went there tonight around 1115 and the drive thru worker didnt have his headphone mic off and just kept cursing saying this is bull and kept on I go to order my food and he tells me the milkshake machine is down No problem but when I politely ask if theres a certain time it
5911,1,This place is the absolute pits I have never experienced such poor management The space can not hold the patrons We were definitely at capacity and then some Theyre three floors and yet my dad and autistic daughter had to eat in the corner like slaves You see my daughter is very routine so she is use to getting her happy meal and then sitting down to eat At this location no one is
28686,1,The amount of times I come to this location and the system is down is embarrassing  I work in food I know when people don
5903,1,Bad service and their ATM machine is a fraud be aware of that Has a chip in the card reader slot to scan your card and bank info
28685,1,I was light headed I figured let me stop at this McDonalds seeing that its on my way home and close by I was surprised the shake machine was up and running I ordered large fries and a Strawberry milkshake I paid to much money for a little nit of food My fries had way too much salt on them Because they mixed fresh fries with fries that wrre sitting out basically old kinda stale The milkshake had vanilla at the bottom with Strawberry on top But that nits what kinda upset me it was the size of the shake I was asked what size I wanted Of course I was confused I guess all McDonalds are not the same I said small But the cup I received was a cup size you order off the dollar menu And I was charged like 5 bucks for it Smh Never again I thought shake size was only small or large  Not a baby cup size
28683,1,Says 247 Mobile app allows for drive through order Lights are all on and drive through speaker is active But nobody is working Location is closed no sign no disabling online orders nothing
28681,1,This is the second time Ive came to this McDonalds and they are closed How you 24 hours but closed They very rude Last time they told me they open at 7am in the drive thru then this morning I was told 630am I come to this one because its so close to my house But it seems Im going have to find another one This McDonalds need a manager and someone who can be in charge and know how to handle a restaurant When I come to this McDonalds I always spend 40 or better Get yall stuff together
5918,1,I entered to the restaurant and immediately a black guy with black clothes told me with a rude attitude that I need to buy something I tell him thats ok then I start watching the Menu and 3 minutes later the same guy with a rude attitude again and raising his voice told me that if I do not buy anything right away I need to leave the building By far the worst experience in a fast food at my Life
14181,1,"Ordered 3 double cheese burger fries combos all were coldthe cheese wasnt even melted Fries were burned and i ordered a 10piece nugget asked for sauce at drive thru and at window when i get home nothingplus plus i ordered 2 fish Sandwiches also asked no tarter sauce
Cause i cant stand itthey added it on both sandwiches
Usually yall dont fail me but IDK what happen this time"
5920,1,Service sucks Customer service needs to definitely improve with the workers Tables dirty I asked a worker to wipe the table off so my family and I could eat he told me No Therefore I went and got napkins to clean the table while he stood around First and last visit not to mention Im a visitor from another state
28680,1,constantly miss items it baffles me I work fast food items pop up on a screen you put them in the bag its very simple half the time they put ice in the drink when I ask for no ice which again a drink pops up on a screen and underneath it will say no ice Im not really sure if yall just dont care or if this is really that hard

14199,1,Just like the rim location this place has closed early without any posted signs  This is becoming almost an everyday thing and the 24hrs is not being followed  Try whataburger or taco cabana across the highway instead  Very disappointing to see this over and over again
28692,1,This isnt the first time it happens but its definitely the one that bothered me the most Went for lunch did a mobile order to make  it quick and spent 20 minutes of my 30 minute lunch waiting for my food Had to walk in and ask for it No napkins or st

5897,1,Very poor security at this location Its impossible to go in without being harassed by people asking for money and the staff dont even try to ask them to leave
14189,1,They redesigned the inside and its Extremely Loud and noisy because the childrens area is wide open to the area where adults would be sitting and you cant even hear the TVs its so loud from the kids I will not be eating inside of this McDonalds ever again Also felt PUSHED to use a Kiosk instead of the 2 girls at the COUNTER why have ANYBODY UP FRONT IF US AARP PPL cant use their services Never again
28695,1,Always takes longer than any other drivethru Advertises that the drivethru is open 24 hours both online and with signage at the store but it isnt

14124,1,"Its McDonalds I never expect anything to much
But I do expect the servers to be nice to customers and each other But sadly that is not true at this location My server showed no interest or seemed not to care that he has to work
Sadly this is not the first time I experienced this type of service from this location

If you want a quick lunch snack or dinner It is worth the drive to go to the Rim location At least the servers say hi and are friendly"
6133,1,I was there this morning 3 24 2023 6am Trying to order a biscuit and hashbrown Like every day today this lady lost her mind told me to use the big screen to order and get receipts She was doing nothing but standing there she dont want to take my order and keep telling me use the screen and refuse to help mei verbally confronted her there I left without my breakfast If people like her keep working for your well known establishment you loose and get defame your good name because people like her Teach her some manners how to behave with people ho come to your restaurant to have good time She act like I was a homeless person I hope you can do something about this incident  Have a good day  But I will not have good day because I will continue thinking about  what happened this morning with me at your place
6134,1,Customer service wasnt good and there were big rats outside
6136,1,I had an awful experience at this location with one member of the security staff they hire to keep customers and employees 
6137,1,A Disgusting place a bunch of crack heads inside fighting and yelling I ordered a coffee and it was not drinkable

6141,1,Rude staff they talk to each other without paying attention to the work  they always get the sandwiches wrong  dirty place   It should be closed
23707,1,I went to this MC Donalds because it is the closest to my home The food was well below standard My fish was cold and so were the fries From now on I will go to another MC Donalds This one sucks And it wasnt the first time
6147,1,Very poor service I was anxious to go to the toilet but I was asked by the security to provide a receipt first otherwise I would not be allowed to go to the toilet The security attitude was bad I do nt know if it was racial discrimination I wanted to buy two burgers an
23709,1,2nd attempt at this location for dessert didnt have the cinnamon rolls or chocolate drizzle for my mocha frappe 
23710,1,I went up to fern park McDonaldss today and the manager kasey was extremely rude gave me a sassy attitude all because I was missin
23712,1,Waited in line for 10mins to get stale cold hard fries My burger was cold greasy so greasy the bread was soggy I mean What did I wait for Pretty much good on this location
6152,1,Very rude workers dont even let you go to the toilet
23714,1,Went to grab some breakfast here since Chik Fila looked closed Placed order for 2 BaconEggCheese Biscuits and 3 showed up on the screen and the female on the intercom was quite inconvenienced to correct my order Waited a minute but when the items didnt appear on the screen I said Maam and her response was YEA in a condescending scathing tone I said never mind and got out of there Heifer needs a reality check
23715,1,Went with Dad to get milkshakes drive thru and they were actually out of milkshakes  This is not the first time this branch is out of 
13996,1,Its a great place if you want to wait an hour for your food
6132,1,"The male cashier was lazy and rude and tried to charge me the higher prices The 2 hamburgers I ordered were cold  COLD  Worse they did not contain the extra pickles I requested 3 times Yes 3 x The 2 Apple pies were not only cold but worse had been clearly sitting out all day and were so over cooked  I just  spit them out and into the garbage  less than 1 bite
The chicken sandwich was not hot either  and worse  it was waaaay overly smeared  with unhealthy  mayo which  I threw away so as to not suffer food poisoning It was by far the worst fast food restaurant experience ever in my life and it cost me a whopping  9 dollars and 93 cents I WANT A REFUND PLEASE

FINALLY this crowded McDonalds  was the filthiest and dirtiest one Ive ever been in

So very very sad and disappointed

23700,1,"Two employees preparing the food simply didnt wear a mask I am highly dissatisfied with the effort put into enforcing the wearing of a mask Why during this pandemic which has not settled in the least have you not have had a keen eye on employees in order to safeguard the wellbeing of your customers Its unacceptable to have this lack of care while thousands of healthcare workers are having to work day in and out With a mask on To save lives Consider this message before you enter this McDonalds Or any restaurant really because the meal you get can very well be the deciding factor on whether or not you live in weeks time
And the fries were luke warm"
6130,1,Employees make many mistakes and its patrons that hang out there many are addicts
28536,1,Place is dirty I dont recommend no one to stop at this place the drinking fountain is dirty workers have a attitude drive thru takes least 25 min to a car to move
28550,1,took 30 minutes for our food to come out walked past us once forgot the sauces and forgot the drinks along with a very negative attitude
6109,1,Very rude security I came to buy a coffee and use a restroom I prefer to use a restroom first They yelled at me and put a flash lighter directly in my face that I have to buy coffee first But i dont prefer to go to the restroom with coffee or leave it on the table and expecting that someone spit in it 
28549,1,Terrible I ordered my food at 840 AM it is currently 901 and my food is still not here
23688,1,Worst McDonalds you can possibly find in Florida If I could give 0 stars that would be more suitable  They mess up orders theyre the only McDonalds in 10 miles that charges extra after 2 pumps of sugar They dont understand what light ice means and youre going to have problems if you are trying to use their app for coupons Please do not allow this McDonalds to ruin your experience and take your money any McDonalds within 5 miles of this location will provide you the proper service McDonalds is iconic for Take it from a local stay far away from this location unless you like waiting ridiculous wait times and feeling cheated out of your money I have visited this location enough times to understand they are literally the worst location I have been to This is coming from someone who has been all around central Florida Please do yourself a favor and go to any other McDonalds to get the experience you deserve
14033,1,The WORST We use drivethrucurbside pickup because we have busy lives Weve sat at both for over 25min When the manager Nathan picked up the phone he sounded upset because I was calling He said he would look into my order because he was currently busy getting orders
6114,1,Managersecurity gard working on 0212  was extremely unpleasant and screamed at us Store was dirty and a health hazard Dont go there
14032,1,"The low score is for the Maroon Shirt Manager on 4323 who took the phone off the hook and still allowed the app to sell curbside orders that would never be delivered due to the phone being off the hook Then making people sit in the lobby and ignore them while she sat and responded to surveys Well maam  here is one for you since apparently surveys take president over service

It took the Blue Shirt Manager realizing nothing was being done up front to get anything done She realized the Maroon Shirt Manager had the phone off the hook for 4 hours apologizing correcting issues and holding people accountable to get anything going  To her I am sorry that this is a low scoring survey She deserves better than that"
6156,1,Apparently theres a bouncer for
23689,1,Cashier Jamesha mocking customers laughing in their face Moving very slow At her own beat Very rude If I were apart of the Wright family she would definitely not be apart of my family business I was in drive thru for 25 minutes before parking and coming inside all to witness the foolery which has the line backed up in the first place However Jamesha is the only one who had a name tag on Everyone looked over worked and under paid Very slow Also as Im writing this review waiting my order its been 35 minutes here total The manager sets the tone and she is even slower Her walk expresses shes lazy
23691,1,This location was awful today They rang up our order wrong then gave it to us still wrong Took over 15 min to get our order and we had to ask for our drink cups so we could at least get our drinks while waiting As we stood there we saw almost every person have a problem with their orders The person at the register was messing up every order and the back kept making the wrong things Worst visit ever
23692,1,Horrible service Drive thru speaker was not lit upbroken and when I pulled up to order I was greeted rudely I asked if I could order at the window and the lady said i guess so My order was also wrong and the bacon burger came with no bacon BAD place to visit during a 3rd shift

6192,1,Supervisor is a mean person that every time she has a argument somebody get hurt is really incompetent and if Im lying look for all there latest news And you will find tha the first with her and a client and it end security harming people I am so sorry to say this I was a suing manager in McDonalds when I was younger and there are better ways to handle situations
6193,1,Payment Warning The nonAmerican foreigners who run this restaurant is the only McDonalds in United States that do not accept Discover Card for payment
28502,1,Well lets see it took me 27 minutes to go through their bullship drivethrough for 2 mcdoubles holy shedding this a joke
23745,1,Worst McDonalds The girl at the window had no idea what she was doing She got an attitude and got her manager because she couldnt handle why we were asking for the new garlic white cheddar burger Every worker here makes it obvious they dont want to work
6197,1,If I could give zero stars I would This place is supposed to be open 24 hours but they tell you at midnight their closed and tie the doors shut with what looks like a sweater after youve placed an order T
6198,1,Worst service I ever experienced I ordered one thing but cashier decided to sell me double of what he thought was better When I asked for my money back Angel the shift manager was very rude verbally and physically I will never be going to that establishment again
23742,1,The person who took our order charged us for a large meal and then rang in a small drink When I questioned the girl giving us our items she got defensive and accused the drink machine She argued with us the entire time she was fixing the problems Never again
23685,1,3rd visit in 3 weeks to the one  simeron in Apopka near hunt club  first time was slow service the second visit I was told at the drive thru they couldnt take anymore orders because the staff didnt show up but yet took orders in the other lane and todays visit again super slow and after we left the drive thru realized the sweet tea was not sweet Im so done with this location
6179,1,very very dirty and broken tables and benches
28511,1,Horrible customer service Avoid this restaurant if at all possible
23719,1,Boy this place is really going down Th He tubes I ordered a fish sandwich and there was a 14 piece of unmelted cheese It was cold and looked like it was run over by a truck Whats up Golden Arches
6161,1,Ive been more than patient with this place I understand this is a tough area to work because I work near this restaurant At this point closing so early randomly is unacceptable Its like you are gambling with the little time you have for break And the site says 24 hours and still no dining They have security so dodging the seedy types should not be an issue here
6162,1,I have never seen such a disgraceful service in my life workers are very rude That woman at the cash register shouldnt be standing there should get out of work You cant treat customers like dogs who are you 
23720,1,This is the most run down mcdonalds I think there is in existence What happen all the new models they have everywhere else in Orlando and the country Came here when I first moved to the area and was given literally rotten lettuce on my quarter pounder that I paid 30 cents extra for I bit into the rotten lettuce and thats how discovered it I had to talk to the manager and he though making me a new one was fair Eventually after threatening to rep
6164,1,"
Despite the fact that its front sign explicitly says Open 247 they unethically keep the doors tide shut from the inside based on a madeup rule that you have to show proof of an order from your  phone Even if your phone is dead in the middle of the night and youre starving they still wont let you simply walk inside to order like everyone else in America This is place is bad for business DONT bother"
28520,1,They didnt have apple slices and toy for the Happy meal
6166,1,Terrible experience  Filthy  No soda at all  Staff could not have been ruder if they tried
23729,1,Loud speaker at drive thru Due to technical difficulties were closed Yet someone is getting served right in front of me Theres a reason yall are called crackdonalds and nobody goes to yall anymore  Thought with WAWA opening up across the street this would change  guess i was wrong for trying
28519,1,Cant ever get order right Had to walk into the back to find someone to wait on me
28517,1,No customer service skills not even the managers always getting orders  wrong and give u attitude bc u said something
23723,1,Sick an tired of ordering food and finding out its wrong when you get home and open it up I ordered fish with extra sauce  The box was marked properly so I left with it Got home and it was about 1 tablespoon
23727,1,I go very often but today is the last timeYou guys never pay attention  i think a good 65 of the time i go  ive gotten the wrong order in the morning  Take a little bit more pride in your work pay attention to detail and care a bit
6173,1,Security worker said we could not eat our food inside and was very disrespectful started taking a video of us and making rude comments while doing so Made us go outside during a severe thunderstorm after purchasing our food No sign saying anything about no eating inside the restaurant Guy just had a power trip and probably upset how his life sucks
28515,1,Super slow service  sloppy wrapped cheese burgers not so friendly staff some of them not all staff what more can i say

14041,1,Got wrong order twice Day 1 missing a Double Cheeseburger went in to tell them and was ignored until they saw I wasnt leaving Next day ordered a Sausage McGriddle drive thru and got a Sausage and Egg McMuffin How hard is it to get a simple order right Seriously
14093,1,Horrible experience First the person taking order sounded rushed I barely mention my first item and you just constantly get What else what else what else before Im even done talking Second I asked for my fries to be WELL DONE I got nasty undercooked fries Either that or they were old fries I get to the window and present a coupon for a discount The guy looks for the numbers instead of just scanning the QR Code pops his head back out the window and tell me the same total What happened with the coupon Did it not take Hi
28599,1,The food tastes like microwaved meat with barley any flavor
6042,1,Went here and got a quarter pounder and it was red in the middle said not to be a pain but can i get another burger get the other burger and the guy threw it in the grease trap  to cook it  horrible  i couldnt eat it   will not be going here again
23654,1,If I could give it zero stars I would Your MANAGER is RUDE Someone ordered breakfast at 1050am she said no more breakfast I said there is no more breakfast She said out loud in front of customers ends at 1030 EVERYONE KNOWS THAT No everyone DOESNT know that some serve it 247 She continued to berate me
14090,1,Dont ever try ordering online for pickup here If you do you had better bring the device you ordered on They dont care If thats a phone tablet or desktop computer they expect it to be here before they will release the food to you My wife ordered pur food so that she didnt have to relay everyones orders over the phone to me Got to the restaurant and they literally wanted me to drive home and get my wifes phone for security reasons They also took no responsibility saying its our falt for not being normal and brining the device like everone else and wouldnt offer any solutions We ended up canceling the order and going to ChickfilA who by the way my wife ordered online and they let me pick up without needing the device I called corporate and they said in this situation the staff at this location should have just asked for the order number and brought me the order
6046,1,so I called them up and was going to order when all of a sudden I hear SHUT UP into the phone several times Then I tried calling them up again to tell them what had happened and they hung up not even caring
14089,1,Lobby still closed even though Whataburger and everyone else has opened up  So you get to spend 20 to 30 minutes waiting in the drive through line to place an order that half the time they screw up  Happened again today  A simple 1 meal with a coke  Got only the Big Mac and nothing else  Pointed it out to the lady and handed her the bag back  She disappeared for few minutes and when she returned with my order shoved it at me and rudely turned away like it was all my fault  This is probably the worst run McDonalds in the area   Dont recommend it at all
14098,1,"I had revise my earlier review left underneath this new one

Just had the most bizarre experience The lady who took my money at the first window seemed to have a problem with me wanting my change back She FOLLOWED me to the other window and started harassing me BETWEEN the barriers meant to stop the spread of Covid 19 Multiple times she stuck her face between the windows to berate me She asked me what else I was waiting for after I got my drink As I had just given her my money she shouldnt be handling my food at all much less trying to talk to me and knew I had a burger She then closed the window and started throwing a coniption that I couldnt hear The then reopened the windows stuck her face between the barriers and told me she knew what I had ordered I told her I didnt understand and she shoved her face further out and repeated she knew what my order was again closer and more loudly I dont get it Ive been here many times and gotten my food without any problems This young lady not only made the food leave a bad taste in my mouth but she is exposing people to the potential life threatening virus for no reason Very very poor attitude and dangerous actions because I wanted my change

Great they have really turned things around in the last couple years The service used to be slow and highly inconsistent These days despite all the challenges the restaurant industry has faced they overcame whatever had been stopping them from providing the McDonalds Standard fast food with correct orders Not sure if they got new management training or equipment but these guys have brought back the Gold Arch Standard Great job team"
28596,1,It
14086,1,Drive to the next McDonalds This place is robbing people French fries are ALWAYS old and cold There will be something missing or wrong with your order 95 of the time They served me old expired pies Im convinced there is no management and the owners do not keep track of whats going on in their own restaurant Once they have messed up your order there
6051,1,I came in to place an order for a number 2 meal tonight and the cashier spoke very rude to me called me papi I was really offended by her tone Frankly I will never dine at this establishment
6052,1,This place is awful All workers had a attitude and the food made my 5 year old cousin throw up 5 times and my friends  I stomach her  caused both of to have diarrhea
14084,1,Worst McDonalds Ive ever been too The disrespectful teenager that brought my food to my car was slow and never spoke a word 
28592,1,Everything is trash at the McDonalds there 
14080,1,Working for doordash in that area and everytime I go to pick up a order  I wait over 30 minutes atleast  People are just standing around and doing nothing  I even asked who the manager is and the lady pointed to the guy sitting down eating  This hasnt just happened once it has happened every time  I dont like to accept orders from McDonald because of this but I have to make money  This place needs to get their stuff in gear  Its a busy place and not really any competition
14079,1,If I could put no starts I would First off the girl working the drive through got our order wrong So then when we pulled up to the second window the boy was giving us a ton of attitude We get our food and the fries are burnt and old and theres no salt on them so they taste old and bland
14087,1,There is no way to rate your establishment very  disheartening due to we were on the road and needed to sit and rest before getting back on also need to use the restroom Food was great but cant really give proper rating cause of this I enjoy McDonalds but I getting a bit feed up with the dining closure everywhere Please do not reply due to pandemic and safety due to other establishment being open I travel a lot on the road and soon will be passing up every McDonalds due to this I stop because of the Kids Disheartening once again
6060,1,Insanely rude and terrible customer service
14101,1,I previously had great service with the last McDonalds leadership team  They were prompt and efficient  This current team lacks the standards of the previous one  Car lines were backup and missing items ordered in the bag over 20 minutes for a hot apple pie unacceptable I thoug
14106,1,Been understaffed for over a month You expect McDonalds to be there for your midnight cravings I remember a group of people were told that McDonalds was not taking their order due to being understaffed yet there were 3 people in the back It only takes 2 people to run things back there What do you do during the day when youre understaffed Lose out on the incoming money If 2 people cant function in the back then you shouldnt be working there to begin with Simple as that
14123,1,Ordered their all day breakfast around 9pm after work and had 2 hash browns and a sausage biscuit The biscuit was so hard that I could not bite through it and I even made a hole in the top when I was just trying to bend it to see if it would move and obviously it was very old I was inside so I took it back and asked for a new one and  I  even apologized for causing them trouble I waited about 10 minutes and when they brought what was supposed to be a new one out to me it was the same one It was smashed so they had probably tried to see if I was lying about the texture and smashed it when they saw how hard it was They had reheated it and gave it back to me with the hole on the top biscion to not do so Imagine what they are giving you 
23643,1,im honestly only leaving one star because i have to staff was rude as can be i went through the drive thru and ordered a 9 the 2 cheeseburger meal and an extra cheeseburger with a small fry and at the window checked the food and the employee was rude asked if we got a problem and rolled her eyes well the order was wrong so good thing i checked went inside the store and finally got my cheeseburgers after standing there for 15 minutes and complained to the manager and she walked away with no response Finally got my food and opened it up and there was A HAIR IN MY FOOD the entire order was wrong the first time around Never will i ever go back to this restaurant again  terrible service i just ended up going bac
14120,1,There were only 3 people ahead of us in the order line  It took 15 minutes before we could order  It took another 15 minutes for our food to come  We were missing parts of our order and everything we ordered was cold  McDonalds corporate needs to visit this location and review service cleanliness and food product5
14119,1,Dining room is closed and the drive thru line is always long Ordering on the app for curbside took over 30 minutes to get our food brought out to us I would recommend waiting out the drive thru if you must have McDonalds
14118,1,Worst McDonalds ever Sorry I usually love all McDonalds
23644,1,They mess with your food here
28617,1,Forgot our food twice Went back and they act like we were lying about it
14105,1,Online says they open at  6 am but staff showing up late and didn
23645,1,I left in fear I was treated so rude Sat at drive through for 20 minutes Was yelled at walking up to window to ask why they are not taking my order Did nothing wrong but was treated like a criminal And then the comment  Dont worry we will take special care of your order in that tone  I WILL NEVER FEEL SAFE EATING AT MY MCDONALDS AGAIN
23646,1,I am done with this Mcdonalds  I have been going there almost every morning and get a double biscuit and gravy How hard is it to get a order correctThey charge me for it but I dont get it It seems when a certain crew is working i get the worst service or no service I have been told they have no gravy no biscuits best one of all at 4 am they do not service breakfast due to corona But waffle house does
14112,1,The service is incredibly slow and the staff clearly couldnt care less about customer service Cashier smelt like a fresh ash tray Make sure you check your bag before driving off I know its fastfood but they could have some standards
6026,1,They didn
14110,1,Pure trash Worst experience on multiple occasions Card swiped and charged twice Took and act of Congress to get it reversed Paid at the first window drove to the second window and employee says You didnt pay for your food Show the receipt and no apology or remorse just oh Hands food to me Last episode shortchanged 20 of a 100 Bill GM says next we checked everything except what was actually take from the register and denies error in the transaction but say Ill give you a free meal and dessert I cant wait to see that location shut down for good Shame on the franchise owner and the corporation for the service at that location Filing a police report and BBB complaint
14109,1,It always takes forever to get somebody to help you
28606,1,Wait for almost an hour for the order The delivery lady missed our table and send our food to another table Worst M store ever
14108,1,Horrible experience There was a long line for the drive thru so I pulled out of line thinking that a curbside order would be faster After 15 minutes I keep seeing employees come in and out but not bringing food to the curbside orders and the line for the drive thru kept moving  Even the car that pulled next to me gestured for me what is going on I called the number on the sign and no one answered I hung up and called again because at this point I was upset and couldnt cancel my order through the app Finally someone answered and I told I had been waiting 20 minutes at this point for my food to come out and I was to cancel my order She said that I had to do it on the app I told her no I already tried and I need the manager to refund me my money She said she was the manager and I had to cancel on the app I asked her how do you do it because I didnnl be out soon with my refund An employee comes out to deliver the car next to me their order I then had to shout over to him where my refund is and he said they were still working on it  Horrible customer service Now I

28583,1,Why 14 minutes for 2 Apple pies Order wss placed 23 minutes before that
6087,1,Apparently people are not permitted to go to the washroom  clean up and reset prior to ordering   I like my food hot and dont agree with this store policy  The manager wouldnt acknowledge me beyond a smirk  I asked for permission  she said nothing but a worker from behind the counter restated the policy  A quartermile away my preferred sequence worked golden  Literally  a STUPID policy implemented by that store and manager
6088,1,Security was nice and open the door for my sister and I to enter I got on the line to make a purchase and my sister went to use the bathroom She informed me of a worker or manager sitting down harassing her for a receipt just to use the bathroom All the workers are hard at work and this lady is sitting down asking for a receipt If theres a customer only restroom why not
6089,1,One of the dirtiest worst McDonalds in the city Absolutely abysmal wait times overworkedunderstaffed workers HORRIBLE manager This particular manager I think shes Ecuadorian needs to be replaced or fired as she is rude  doesn
6090,1,My girlfriend and her friends visited this establishment on 041623 at around 1250AM An African American worker in a grey shirt Male with braided hair was incredibly racist to her and her friends using an Asian accent when talking to them He was originally on the side and took over the register from one of his coworkers on purpose with the intent of being completely racist to them He spoke with an Asian accent ridiculing their race and telling them he can serve them for an extra 500 While this was happening all of the other employees laughed and egged him on My girlfriend and her friends felt very unsafe especially late at night We will try filing a police report today with the local precinct and hope this employee faces consequences
28567,1,Female Mnager day shift wi
6092,1,Most of the ordering machines were broken There was only one cashier so the line moved incredibly slow They refused to refill my ice tea even though the other drinks were refillable through the machine Prices were expensive

23674,1,Just wondering why if the hours on the door say theyre open for Dinein unti
14048,1,Good lord these people cant McDonalds 
6096,1,We went there during NYE just prior to the ball drop The surprising thing was there was homeless folks inside the store walking and smoking next to us when we were preparing to eat The homeless guy was even asking for food to someone next to us It felt very much like a 3rd world countrys experience The tables were dirty as well  maybe they need to hire more people for cleaning in between customers The French fries were cold as well as if they were probably heated long time ago Also the store associates should provide a tray for customers who are going to be sittingeating inside the store instead of paper packets for takeouts
14043,1,ordered a double quarter pounder and received a big mac there was hardly any line for drive thru Yet they cant get the order right
6098,1,Horrible customer service Especially the managment treat everyone as if theyre lower than them no consideration whatsoever Ive been waiting 10 mi
14042,1,if I could give 0 stars I would just off this experience I had tonight Im usually not your typical Karen but when you mess up the same order 3 times in the same night practically in the same hour i will be a Karen So first off I came all the way from boerne because this is the closest Mc Donalds too us  so we get there order our food I ordered 2 10 piece nuggets med fry  large fry and a quarter ponder and happy meal we get our food and sadly we dont bother to check the bag we get all the way back to our house IN BOERNE  we only have our quarter ponder and happy meal and the fry with the quarter ponder meal  I call the McDonalds and tell them what went wrong the lady tells me sbelief
6100,1,Horrible People around food coughing I got a refund asap Im not getting sick for no one How you giving out the food in the front coughing without covering your mouth Cough just spreading You can not make this up Make it make sense What sad is that people need to do better If this was my business it is no way I would want anyone in my establishments like this Whats the point of having a mask on if it is on your chin Than you have the other woman she had her mask on but she kept coughing every other minute Sounding like she coughing up a lung All I wa
6101,1,The worst experience of McDonalds Very rude security and a LOT of homeless people I was worried about myself and my family because I didn
6102,1,Employees have a disgustingly rude attitude literally EVERY TIMEand I havent been there often It was purely out of convience ie on my way to my job and I need to eat or grab a terrible cup of coffee Basically desperation smh on my part So Ill digress theyre all rude they make mistakes and then they basically have an oh well not my problem attitude very stingy with sugarsweetener they also serve  cold food or buns without the beef smh
23682,1,Worst place ever took 16 minutes in the drive thru to get my order it should take no more than 4 min or less to get food out
23657,1,Super rude Suppose to be 24 hrs and they acted like how dare i eat here at like 2am The worker never even spoke to me just took my card and shut the door on me didnt even get a chance to ask for ketchup
6085,1,"I dont know if I could give a start less than 1

The security of this establishment is a rude  non friendly  and a cruel person

I felt completely unsafe with this person around me he heckled me and acted as if seats were reserved in this establishment he was singing and tapping his foot like a mad man

It is safe to avoid this restaurant if you dont want to suffer a racist encounter Deeply disappointed that an establishment like McDonalds would hire people like this guy"
23673,1,1st time I came they said they were closed Its a 24 hr McDonalds Second time I came at 430 am still had to wait more than 15 min in Drive thru for order Only 3 cars ahead of me Ridiculous
23658,1,They never ever give me the amount of cream and sugar I ask for in my coffee The super lazy ones tell me their cream and sugar dispensers are broken at least one to two times a week  been visiting the one and extra mile away in Casselberry just bc they make my coffee how I want This location used to get a LOT of my hard earned dollars but as of late I been choosing other location
6065,1,Its a disgusting place those bathrooms were overflowing they dont take care of the place Dont even want to guess whats going on in the kitchen
23661,1,"My order  was 1471 Simple order Big breakfast with extra sausage
No utensils no syrup no extra sausage
So I call Nina said she was the manager But transferred me to Bri Told Bri what happened and she said she would talk to the crew So I explained that does not help me I still dont have what I paid for She asked how she could help I asked her to hang on while I answered another phone Instead she hung up Few minutes later I called back Now no one will answ"
14070,1,"Long wait at drive thru despite one car in front of me 15 minutes to get a fish sandwich and drink Sandwich was disgusting and wound up throwing it
Out Staff seemed confused as my order sat on the counter with workers waking past it many times before they finally gave it to me"
6069,1,Poor service very bad place
23664,1,Has to be THE most depressing McDonalds in the area Ran by a bunch of immature rude and miserable workers I go there because its the closest to me but wont be going back
14066,1,"Mobile ordered food and waiting about 30 minutes before going in and asking The young man who helped me was very nice but the other man who was working the counter was AWFUL He called a mans order once and while said man was getting up to go to the counter the worker said Oh Not here This is trash then And threw the order away It had net even been 30 seconds since he called out the order When the young man who was working on my order stepped away to grab something the man grabbed my bag and asked what it was and why it was sitting there and started to throw it away Luckily the one helping me stoped him and finished my order While I understand they were busy but that is no way to act This is by far the worst experience Ive ever had at this location Thinking it 
But today I will never order here again and will be in contacting corporate about their behavior After 40 minutes of waiting I go inside and ask for my food and a refund They argued with me that I hadnt ordered when you can see of the app the exact time my order was placed My food was sitting on the counter to be taken out Instead of giving me my food the girl "
14052,1,If I could leave 0 stars I would I have checked in on app and called the store just like they asked twice and Ive been waiting 20 mins for 1 burger and a sprite At 21 mins  they answer and say they are almost ready for it and still waiting I get workers are short and I also get waits but at least hav
23665,1,I bought some sundaes and I requested some napkins but they refused to provide them to me Too miserable for a multinational company If they dont provide napkins what can we expect for the food
6075,1,Always incomplete order when u order cream and equal with your order they never give and when u ask for it they just ignore you
14061,1,"Ive been to this McDonalds twice now and its never been faster than 30 minutes Even with a simple order like fries and a drink
Ordered mobile and it took over 30 minutes for my order and I watched everyone standing in line to order get ignored for 20 minutes at a time Which after reading reviews seems like it is the norm to wait 30 minutes for a single mcgriddle
After I waited over 30 minutes for my order they forgot my drinks which I waited at the counter for another 5 minutes before anyone even asked what I needed and my order was wrong But I wasnt about to sit another half hour for them to remake a different sandwich Not a big deal
Not the employees fault necessarily just seems like theyre EXTREMELY  understaffed
Shame on upper management for allowing this to happen I wouldnt want to work in that environment either"
23669,1,DO NOT EAT HERE Me and 2 friends work right near this McDonalds We all have each gotten sick twice on completely different occasions each time we eat here Im pretty sure they cook these burgers on the floor Dont go here unless you like upset stomachs or puking
6079,1,Extremely rude staff but dont think much of it the people seem to be totally exploited by their horrible Hong Kong boss Pity
28570,1,Worst McDonalds Ive been to
14057,1,I dont know what it is about this particular McDonalds The line is always extremely long and takes forever to get through Its been that way for years and the other day I went through for the 1st time in 4 years and had the exact same result since I lived in the neighborhood adjacent to this McDonalds Nothing has changed in 4 years that has to bad thing right
23671,1,Serivce was horrible i walked in there asked for my drinks serveral times and the workers when lost and confused so i walked in a made my own ice tea then i appertantly caused a distrubance by doing that never going back here
14062,1,Ordered curbside to go sat in spot 3 for 20 min and never received my food Had to take my sleeping child inside Food was prepared but never brought to the car by the time i got home it was all cold Do not recommended this location
27462,1,This McDonalds screws up 96 of the time Tonight was the last straw My husband ordered 2 large fries 2 PLAIN McChickens and 2 large drinksThe drinks were greatthe rest was not even what he ordered and OLD In the bag was a fillet o fish which to my surprise was the only fresh thing 2 medium 5 year old fries and 2 10 year old cheeseburgersseriously the cheeseburgers were so old the cheese was crusting Where is the quality They dont care if people are upset andor get food poisoning Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving but he didnt think to not surprised I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries but an extra sandwich but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrongmeat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it Way to go McDonalds for providing POOR SERVICE yet again
8001,1,The manager is super rude took my receipt out of my hands with out my consent and yell at us trying to get us out of the line Very disappointed
27461,1,I used to go to this McDonalds every morning for breakfast The customer service has gone to hell and they havent gotten my order correct in the drive thru for 8 days in a row No one speaks English well enough to complain they just look at you and smile
26157,1,Long waits even on drivethrough Not the friendliest staff eitherWasup McDonaldsstep it up on your customer serviceyour fries can only keep me coming back for so long
11223,1,This is the only McDonald franchise that charges CHOCOLATE MILK that is supposed to be included in the happy meal Their manager told me that they only give SODA When did kids start to drink soda
26155,1,Take to long and they dont get your order right  employees to slow and on there phone joking and laughing
11222,1,They used to take EBT here and now they dont  If they got the EBT machine back in there Id probably bump the review up to 3 stars but they also got my order wrong today and Ive seen them treat local transients pretty poorly  Even one guy who said he offered to buy a homeless man food without being prompted and stated that the staff kicked the homeless guy out because they thought he asked the man for the food and he said that he left and refuses to go back
26153,1,Super slow Many items not available disgusting customer service Staff did not care at all
26152,1,The manager the works  black her in the morning thinks that treating bad people is good Her service is totally rude And as a manager sucks
26149,1,If you want to stand in front of the register for half an hour and be ignored and end up not ordering this is the place for you
26148,1,This location takes cash only No cards accepted
11221,1,Rip off pricing I seen this first mc Donald try to charge 3 dollar for plain biscuit and they said they dont have egg biscuit key person try to rip off people by saying it depend on owner how they charge Is this Mc Donald They might have to change name Rip off Donald
11220,1,This was the worst place that I have ever been to McDonalds is a joke I remember when this place actually care about what they make and since when did they take the pickles off the Hamburger
11219,1,"This is not a 24 hour establishment
They allow you to place an order via the app and then you show up to pick up your coffee and they come to the window just to tell you they are closed and to dispute the charge with the app Poor service and false business hours advertising"
11217,1,"I use the drive through and I order 2 meals No politeness from any of the 2 people inside I asked for barbecue sauce the girl throw one at me and she really throws it and then told me that if I want more its 25 cents for every barbecue sauce I want Yall should go to the other Macdonald on misson bay they are sweet and respectful and dont ask you to pay for barbecue sauce Its free over there Dont lose your time and money with those people it just does not worth it
Service She throw sauce at me
Atmosphere No politeness

Respectfully"
25585,1,Horrible  received a cheese burger with literally 7 slices of cheese on it When we came back to change it we sat in the drive thru for 5 minutes while the cashier talked to her friend in the drive thru
25586,1,Cashier and staff made us feel very unwelcome Unfriendly staff Very rude and disrespectful Needless to say we didnt stay
11214,1,"worst macdonalds i have been to

i walked in and ordered mac nuggets i payed with quarters because i had to get rid of mine change  the lady walked off out of nowhere and came back and said you haven"
26158,1,Quite possibly the worst McDonalds on this plan
26159,1,They said is 24 hours but do not come to this place at 330 am they said is close  Is not right I drive 15 min to come here and they said is close  Worse ever

11233,1,Terrible at the night Staff is unfriendly and sometimes rude when after 40 minutes of waiting I asked where my order was a guy named Gustavo just turned away and left  They say that they have a lot of orders and few people  Firstly at least two people there only did what they went back and forth but they could help other employees to speed up the process  But my god why should the service suffer from this  Hire more people for the weekend  Or did you not guess that people come to you on Saturday night Supervisors need to conduct trainings for staff otherwise they forgot how to communicate with customers and how the company makes money  And in the end where is your smile  Or are the good old days of smiling gone
26169,1,Mornings after 6 system down therefore no food to be served Or they sorry were closed When you have 24hr service and nothing is ready
11232,1,Probably the worst McDonalds in the area The crew is always slow The service is never fast The restrooms and dining are are sometimes dirty but thats because of the customers Thank goodness they have kiosks to order food I recommend ordering through the mobile app if possible Theyre always busy Theyd get more stars if they improved their service first
26142,1,Be aware of cashier at drive thrue not providing costumer with card  receipt  charging in excess

11231,1,If you like waiting an hour for your food this is the spot for you
26139,1,Did the mobile order arrived to pick up my order they didnt see my order I became combative and argumentative because when I ask to speak with an manager she did not attempt to come to the window yes I was a bit more upset but as a supervisor you try to deescalate the situation and you failed to do that
25587,1,I had to wait 15 minutes for a Happy Meal and Mc Chicken sandwich The person bringing your order had  no mask on
11212,1,If I can give zero Stars I would I went in in front of the very beginning she didnt want to take my code for the app then they literally gave me just the buns that were burnt and burnt chicken and when I asked for my money back they didnt want to give me the rest just the burger and I said thats fine but I need my fries and she threw my fries away in front of me and literally said that there was nothing there So basically theyre pathological liars and like to take advantage of others I also believe theyre all family members working there
26119,1,Worst macdonalds in the area rude employees and very slow service dont come hereedit no mask or gloves where being properly worn ether

I know its McDonalds and you cant expect exceptional service but dont make it so obvious that youre being rude on purpose"
11277,1,Physically waited in line for a hour while the drive thru and uber eats received seniority Most had already walked away after placing an order with random folks taking what they can get unchecked as the attendants stopped caring after the first 10 minutes Please close this location as it is no longer viable
11299,1,Hands down the worst McDonalds Ive ever been to The staff
9809,1,A misery no hot coffee no fruit juice and almost nothing in breakfast Terrible when you come for lunch And the sanitary facilities open with a room The greatest anything from Mac Do Never seen

11255,1,Slowest fast food ever
11254,1,Lobby closed early and would not take our order in the drive through even though we were paying customers clearly displaying their classism as we did not have a car Encouraged two inebriated individuals in front of us to come back with in car recommended getting a DUI
26192,1,Horrible service 30 minutes for chicken nuggets that should never happen management is definitely a must
26190,1,Garbage service In the drive thru line for 30 minutes No exaggeration Place should be shut down
11252,1,This is the most disorganized Mc Donalds I have been to in my life They are the slowest most unprofessional and disrespectful one that I have ever seen I live at the corner so I did not have a single experience It was multiple ones and it is always the same terrible service Once I had to wait 30 minutes for a simple and should be quick coffee But the last time I went there was the worst I stayed around 20 minutes in the counter and nobody was capable to ask me if was in need of something I was picking an order up which took me almost 1 hour 20 minutes until somebody talked to me  30 minutes waiting for the food They are just always so messy that from now on every time I want to eat a burger I consider first going to Wendys or Jack in the Box or another Mc Donalds store not this one anymore
11250,1,Location a bit of an inconvenience service could have been better Cashier was slow did not ring up my order  correctly had on gloves and was touching his hat money pulled his phone out of his pocket several times and was handling food this is not sanitary Not happy at the fact that we waited for 15 minutes for 3 large fries as we watched the drive thru serve 8 other orders before ours and we were the only customers inside at the time Having worked for mcdonalds in the past I know for a FACT it takes just a little over 2 minutes to fry a full basket of fries which leads 3 large fries And if they had 3 baskets down at once which they did then there should be no reason to have had us wait for so long Will not return to this location
11249,1,Twice I ordered iced coffee from this location Both times the iced coffee tasted horrible Thats my last time going to that place They really need to get t

11246,1,Seriously this McDonalds is the WORST Ive ever seen Advertise themselves as being 247 but are always closed when I go at night The staff is rude and Im always waiting for what seems like forever usually 20 minutes The worst part about this place is that they consistently screw up EVERY order Hell half my order will be missing like it was just now and theyll flat out REFUSE to fix it
11245,1,Long waits I guess is not a drive thru anymore Faster service if you walk inside
26178,1,"Food is disgusting like any McDonalds

11248,1,"Unbelievable that everyone else has the same complaint as methey never get the order right

Tonight I realized that they forgot an item after coming home with food for the family I first tried to call just to get reimbursedbut no one answered the phone

Then I decided to drive back for a refund while the rest of my food went cold on my dining room table When I got to the drive thru I politely asked for a refund for the item they forgot

Having worked in the food industry myself in the past the service was awful For the sheer inconvenience they should have refunded me and at least offered the missing item to me free of charge However all that was given was a refundnot even an apology to go along with it

Terrible service along with the terrible cold food that I then had to go eat at home thanks to my having to drive back for a refund

Mistakes can happen but not as often as they happen here Do yourselves a favor and avoid this location"

11271,1,I have traveled all across the worldI have eaten at McDonalds in the UK Japan Mexico and across America The McDonalds at 1121 Garnet Ave in Pacific Beach has to be the very worst Mcdonalds ever This reflects on the managers and poorly trained staff The staff is very rude and incompetent I now travel to the other Mcdonalds on 4711 Mission Bay Dr The staff are polite well trained and food is always hot fresh and up to Mcdonalds standard quality
11270,1,Ive lived next to this McDonalds for over 10 years and never go in because of the overwhelming number of vagrants in and around the building  I have two kids now and they of course like McDonalds  They recently renovated it so I was optimistic and took them in there for breakfast  Right away there was a bum outside the door yelling to himself and when we walked in there was another one lying on the ground next to the tables  I went back a month later for happy meals and the kids wanted to eat there  All the tables and floors were dirty and they still had bums outside and in  While we were waiting for the food a homeless guy wanted to use the bathroom but there was a lock on it When he asked a worker they said it was for customers only and the homeless guy started  only a block from my house
26211,1,Terrible service My fries were cold and soggy chicken nuggets were burnt and old and even my soda was flat
11266,1,"Been to this location 5 times now and have NEVER had a good experience The first two times I waited 30 minutes with only a couple of cars in front of me the first time and NONE in front of me the 2nd The first time was so bad that the whole line of cars were honking and going over the curbs to get out of line These people take FOREVER and are rude as hell Not sure if they need new management or a whole new workforce but this place is AWFUL

10092,1,This location consistently neglects basics like including sauce utensils and will substitute your desert side for whatever else they feel like  If you order a coffee with extras 45 times they wont put them in I like any normal person loathe paying for things I dont get This happens often but today something egregious happened I ordered a 3 pack of cookies Checked the bag there were only 2 inside So I asked for the 3rd a woman working there snatched the cookies from me and darted back i assumed to grab the missing item she returned empty handed and said more cookies are coming I wasnt willing to wait and asked for my 2 cookies back but She wouldn

10047,1,I had recently ordered a chicken sandwich combo  3 weeks back mind you I havent had it in 7 years because I knew any and All fast food is bad for the body But baybeeee the day I opened my meal the chicken looked like a soggy wet pad with extra mayo  some green grass that looked like lettuce  but was soggy as well The only thing I got to enjoy were my fries I should have told them to run me my money back with a free ice cream but we all know they machines stay broke d

10033,1,The worst McDonalds Ive ever seen The service is incredibly unpleasant and unwilling You enter a locator at the kiosk but you still have to go to the counter for your order Find out they havent a cappuccino You ask what others can they offer you  without an answer You talk about coffee with milk and you get something disgusting that doesnt even remotely resemble coffee Without apology with unpleasant looks and even with a rude comment among the employees Terrible customer service
10034,1,You have never experienced a food establishment like this one before Probably because theyve all been shut down Ive been reluctantly stopping in this place while shopping in Macys for many many years and its the same experience everytime At this point I do it for the entertainment The kiosk and ordering setup is a recipe for disaster just for starters But you will usually wait 3045 minutes just to be told that all the food and everything you ordered is sold out If youre lucky enough to get your food and it seems edible theres 0 chance the dining room will be open With all that said its not even the worst part The staff are the craziest rudest nastiest human beings you will ever experience They have zero filter They scream and curse at eachother and the customers One time I got yelled at for asking for sweet and sour sauce and they then proceeded to gather and talk about me asking for sweet and sour sauce as if theres something wrong with that After ignoring the request I asked again and she made an over exaggerated movement while rolling her eyes and putting her hand out telling me it was 1 For 1 sauce It was the best entertainment Ive ever received for the money

25441,1,"Went today after the zoo it was a very bad experience to say the least
We were given over seasoned  fries one straw for three drinks and the drinks were all bad
I thought how do you mess up a drink
It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee
She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction
It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits I mean really sour
The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries
When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids
Will not ever return"
9454,1,Its a nice place with good taste of Burger but the associates attitude is just so rude Poor customers service

11595,1,This place has horrible accuracy and dont care to answer the phone EVER
26528,1,"Good morning Please tell me if this matters or if Im being to sensitive or petty or overly concerned Maybe because I didnt have my coffee this morning

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning This morning I forgot my wallet I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than 500 breakfast tomorrow They said so sorry No I pleaded with this new manager that Id never seen before I asked for the manager that Id spoken with on several occasions
She refused to see me and he stated that her response would be the same I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us He said it would be discarded

Seriously I asked So I said that youd rather throw it away then let me have it a faithful customerSo my lesson is now Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson McDonalds doesnt care about my patronizing their establishment and Im going to seriously break my coffee habit No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me
A lesson well learned can you believe my feeling was hurt when he said that my breakfast was to be discarded"

11550,1,Waited at front for 5 minutes not greeted even though employee was there running around
25458,1,"Be careful with young children here We had a women approach our booth and asked personal questions about my young niece while my brother was getting the food We tried to dismiss her and did not answer her questions but she just sat herself in our booth uninvited We asked her to leave several times because it was very uncomfortable She just continued to sit and stare at my neice We made it clear we were having a private lunch and would like her to leave
Then the womens boyfriend called her back to his table she left us and then they walked out shortly after
Another patron approached us after the women left our table because she believed the women was planning to abduct my niece She noticed the women staring at my niece and told us to be safe When we left they were parked next to our truck as well We will definitely not be going back there"
9505,1,Horrible place to eat Felt like I was in a homeless shelter kitchen restroom are filthy 
25459,1,Dirty Dirty Dirty We saw previous customers coming back to get their orders fixed Every table in the play place was awful Ours had spilled milk The employee took one trash can out but didnt pick up the trays and didnt clean up the busted bbq sauce on the floor What was also bad was that we moved to another table and the floor was covered with napk

26332,1,On Nov 2221 I went to use the mens restroom and it was so filthy and because this is a place where a lot people visit the attention to the restrooms should be made more often

But I got a crispy chicken that was chicken and bread Nothing else A chicken in a dry bun"
26349,1,So overall they usually have one of the fastest services especially when it comes to McDonalds in regards to what Im doing doordash Only problem being at this location is a hub for intoxicated panhandling homeless people
11374,1,If I could give it zero stars I would waited an hour for my meal in the drivethrough

Instead of making sure its done correct She proceeded to go help another customer which took her about 4 to 5 minutes when she knew I come first but she didnt care I asked her again when she returned to her post where is my food and She got quickly defensive with me and refuse to get me a hot free fries since I had to wait too long for my order
I throw away my cold fries and just proceeded to get the hell out of there
I am done arguing with these black or not black l management fault They just hire any one for the job and they dont pay attention to what goes on in thei"

25553,1,Did not provide a receipt and didnt give us the chocolate milk in happy meal Rude service Shame on this location 
11317,1,Disgusting there was a customer who walked up to the counter and said his big mac was cold The manager traded the burger with another and put the one the customer brought BACK in the hot warmer to resell An employee asked her if she should throw it away the manager told her no its ok GROSS
11314,1,McDonalds generally sucks out loud This one is even worse I dont think the drive thru has ever gotten an order correct Theyre constantly running out of staple items ie they dont have fries at the ready or the shake machine is busted If thats not bad enough its a hang out for the local homeless And not decent homelessthe methed out violent type
11313,1,Absolutely garbage was rushed while placing the order then the girl at the window was talking with someone for 10 minutes who cut in line at the drive through and they didnt even order anything without a mask on whi

11312,1,stuck in the drive thru over 25 minutes cars in front and behind us and they had no drinks available put a huge damper on the vacation employees were clearly irritated and rude by far the worst McDonalds experience ever
25554,1,Terrible food and terrible service While waiting at the window someone started yelling at the employee in which he stopped to yell back and call her a bit and tell her that someone named bebe wont be in till 5 Highly inappropriate and I felt I should have drove off which would have been the better decision No one should ever go here and they should rethink the staff
9789,1,Run away

11306,1,Manager on duty Ignacio extremely hostile and rude I am an Uber driver and I have visited this location two weekends in a row It is a very busy location on Saturday evenings On my first visit I went to the drivethru and ordered 10 worth of food and then parked and ran inside to ask to use the restroom he told me I had to pay a quarter I then explain to him that I just had come through the drivethru and I was a customer he said oh well you have to pay a quarter On my second visit one week later I walked in ordered a coffee and politely asked him for a token for the restroom Ignacio appeared to become upset by my request so much so that he actually tossed it at me hard enough for it to bounce off the counter and land on the floor He did not apologizehe just walked offI feel he should be reprimanded for his blatant disrespect and rude Behavior towards paying customers If this location is too much for him to handle maybe he should transfer somewhere else I will never return to this McDonalds again as long as the manager Ignacio is in charge
25555,1,Doesnt deserve a single star My burger was slopply made and half sticking out of the box Way to much pepper poured on the chicken and gave us a drink instead of a shake that I ordered By far the worse mcdonalds in Texas area Would never come back and rather drive out of Dallas to order my food at another Mcdonalds
26266,1,My daughter her friends and i was at this particular McDonalds while visiting the boardwalk out of town visitors There was roaches all over the place and they were big The place was not clean Homeless people surrounded the place  I will never go back and i have already told a lot of people that were headed that way
11310,1,"Chips were not hot and staff seemed too busy to talk when I tried to get condiments There was a few customers but the bag was basically thrown at you and then you were never looked at again

Edit Ive since been back and my friend had to wait 10minutes for a Coke They then tried to claim theyd called it when they had clearly forgotten about it as it was sitting on the drinks machine with no lid Not sure what the management of the place is like but theyd want to change something Staff are awful and rude"
26354,1,Too many homeless people that kept walking in and out of this location we couldnt eat comfortably because they smelled so bad as they passed by I understand they cant help it due to their situation but if you have a hard time tolerating body odor of various homeless people walking back and forth in this McDonalds location then you should definitely avoid this location
11326,1,Food slow and inaccurate often A lot of homelessriffraff hanging out front Inside and Outside seating Low food quality Okay for a late night snack but not good for Monday morning rush hour

26395,1,Go anywhere else Not here Beyond the counter this place is never clean  Glorified truck stop  Too many other options next door and nearby that are more deserving of your business Especially since the dining room is no longer open 24 hours  No drive through Sad Literally steps from the pier The collective grime of all of Santa Monica resides on this location surrounding sidewalks The homeless arent the issue  It is the mentally disturbed  the hustlers  and questionable addicts This is not a family friendly location  Wisely most families recognize this and steer clear  These truths sometimes slip pass the trained smiles of the cashiers and you see the weariness and defeat  No other business has these issues  Not one  Food  No problems
9649,1,does not open 24 hours
11420,1,Ive been in drive through line for 45 minutes Line is not that long  but very very very slow

10877,1,A Restaurant without a Restroom  In the Pandemic  And no Sanitizer With  capacity of over 100 seats In South beach  Miami Possibly coz the profit is not good to pay a cleaner    You should say Mcdonalds  partners coz the customers use the surrounding restaurants and streets to wash their hands or to pee Still Unique coz you cant find this in suburbans of Delhi or Khartoum  Shame

25842,1,"For workers like her big companies name are ashamed

What a horrific experience I just had  this lady you see in the picture for telling her she was giving me a wrong item and not the one I paid for she started a big drama and spilt my sons smoothie and started singing a vulgar songlyrics as per offending me through that and not directly addressed to me All that in front of the manager 

Besides that waiting time was ridiculous long with a lot of customers not satisfied and even a uber eats guy had to cancel in front of  me because they didnt make his order in more than 20 min that I was there 

Another lady in the back was not using the yellow paper that sandwiches have she was placing the  bunsbread directly on the table as she was preparing food for dogs She saw me and start acting like nothing happened

This place is a completely mess

JUST STAY AWAY"

I dont have 4 hands i take orders after i finished serving all the orders Im not gonna get a stroke
Come one man You are working in a Mc Donalds you have to be fast and take orders while serving That job is not for that guy There are a lot of good workers out there who needs a job and that guy dont appreciate that I hear him saying to another employee change your face because if you dont like it you can quit

25833,1,Its McDonalds so I dont expect much if anything but the people running this one dont have a care in the world Staff walking around in the back wearing scruffy old pyjamas looking street wear ie not the uniform and not even clean looking personal clothes No hairnets Kiosks not working Slow service at the counter and long wait for food Missing items I could go on
25832,1,i am a tourist here  i came in the prices were already higher but that was fine the problem was the employees i ordered a rootbeer  but cashier didnt speak enough english to tell me he kept saying no ice i stood there for 5 min waiting just a simple drink until another worker came over and explained they didnt have the drink and if id like to change which i did pls retrain your employees and have someone with proper understanding at register so that theres no problem
25834,1,"The worst McDonalds I have ever been to First we waited in one of the drive through lane for over 15 minutes just to find out it was out our order No signs and no one notifying the customers The other lane was long so I parked and ordered online for curbside pick up After waiting for a while no one deliver my food so went inside believing maybe they were short staffed but the employees were chatting and wondering around order
Even more disappointing fries were cold and soggy What happened to the tomato lettuce and mayo in "
10873,1,This McDonalds serves as the poster child to why they should fully automated The service is terrible 9pm on a Saturday night and youd think theyve never served humans before More employees standing around doing nothing while the line stretches to the back of the store  Half the items in the menu arent even available One employee endlessly walks around the dinning area sweeping up nothing Food arrivesfrench fries literary have no seasoning at all I ask for salt may as well be asking for solid gold
10651,1,Saturday April 1st  Its suppose to be 24 hrs for Google as google appear And they close at 500 am  What the manager is doing So poor management  Employee told me funking drunk Im wrong I dont know because I drive depending on hours on Google

I went to the 7eleven down the street and bought pizza and a drink instead"
10755,1,Be careful Rude sketchy employeesThey will try to tell you at certain times of nite every order has to be upsized to a large Food was cold and horrible after a long wait Then you still will be  GROSSLY OVERCHARGED Crooks USE THE APP TO BE CHARGED CORRECTLY
10756,1,the worst attention you can receive is here attention 99 Service 99 ask for salt they give you sugar the staff is extremely contemptuous they almost throw the food at you and the chicken burnt if you want to lose your money this is the ideal place
10836,1,There are plenty of comments about poor service not enough about poor quality of food Not only did they mess up multiple orders the chicken was undercooked and not eatable Go eat somewhere else this location wont meet even your lowest expectations of this brand
10835,1,God I swear everytime I come here what a disaster The most incompetent employees Theres a thousand employees and service is super slow Place is always packed and full of homeless people inside and outside the store I dont even get food usually I come in for a iced tea and have to wait 10 min never again

10834,1,If you do anything today Please tell each and everyone of the people that works here they suck From the guy who cant answer the phone and correct an order to the manager that clearly has not one shred of managerial integrity Im sure someone here is worth saving I just never came across them mcdontatall

Food lukewarm so they obviously  not waiting for it to be cooked No point sending it back to wait another 20 minutesNo one giving leadership Ray Kroc will be turning in his grave A disgrace if posssible 0 stars"
10765,1,That McDonald is the worst McDonald ever the purpose of mobile ordering is so you dont have to wait in the store for so long I place a mobile order and there is no parking in that area my car almost got tow that
10766,1,Wow  To say that we had a bad experience would be a compliment  The food was cold they ran out of ice and carbonationyes no carbonation for the sodasand they still kept serving themwe counted at least 10 returned drinks in a10 minute spam  Worst of all the manager offered no apologies  Run dont just walk away from this place

25685,1,Very bad customer service i didnt even get a thank you They  made me way long time for my order
25703,1,They messed up my order and did not want to fix it
10839,1,Terrible experience to say the least Workers didnt care  they were rude Took 15 minutes literally to make a baconegg  cheese biscuit I would never go to this place unless you were starving and only had a couple bucks to your name
10840,1,same as all the other reviews slow only 6 items on the menu employees are on their phones more than their helping customers in front of them Employees also trash talk customers in front of other customers Wasnt even worth the head ache of receiving subpar food for
10733,1,I seen restaurants with a drive thru move faster then this and they dont have a drive thru I been waiting for my doordash order for 15 mins and it took me 4 mins to arrive and still not ready it
10734,1,I was waiting 20 mins for a order that been ready im in the front for like 15mins I never heard my order called up and the guys says that they been called my order like they dont do their job right and they want to lie to my face
25708,1,Never get your order right And when let them know they got your order wrong They get mad smh
10736,1,Worst McDonalds Ive ever been to the people do not speak English a good majority of them and so they will not even try to answer your question they just walk away and ignore you they are not open 24 hours that is a lie it says confirmed by the company but that is not true as they were closed at 600 am and said they dont open till 700 am although their door says open 24 hours thats a lie and if you knock on the door they just ignore you the most ignorant McDonalds employees I have ever encountered
25707,1,It would be nice place if you could enjoy your meal without people asking for money the whole time
10843,1,This McDonalds is an embarrassment to the well known franchise I have never experienced such poor customer service from a fast food restaurant I was making a delivery for postmates and the cashier refused to take the order saying that they didnt sell small fries mocha lattes and that their ice cream machine was broken I wondered why on earth are they open if they dont have a
10842,1,WORST MCDONALDS EVER Considering is in a very important location in town staff is rude lack of service lack of cleanliness Im EXTREMELY impressed of how the staff DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH Zero I speak spanish so I don
10769,1,"Absolutely disgusted with discriminatory management at this location As Im charging my phone in back making an order on app because I didnt have my card The manager Nancy request their security to kick me out I did absolutely nothing wrong other than charge my phone to make an order

Not only did their security guard get rude with me they didnt even have the professionalism to let me know its against rules to charge phone to make an order Only was charging to phone to make order thru app Then after getting kicked out they wouldnt give me a refund or my food said to call number

Me being black I deal with this a lot But I hope reviews like this can help wake people up and hold people accountable for discriminatory behavior

Still want my refund"
10740,1,Should be Minus star   Except for the manager otherwise  Totally shocking staff you would double check if you are in the United States The serving girls treat people as unwanted guests in their own house not serving people they would fight with 12 of the customers sending for police 2 or 3 times daily Slow service and bad manners you  would feel like a kid getting his food from his angry mother with some cursing whispers that you dont understand  in Spanish  Totally crazy
10742,1,Ordered on Uber Eats 4 different delivery person took the order but they all canceled since the food was never ready They never finished my order after waiting for 2 hours This is highly unacceptable such a poor service for the location of the place I expected something better from being one of the only McDonald
10743,1,Absolutely without pause the WORST excuse for a McDonalds Ive seen No coffee No chicken sandwiches No restroom No seating Dirty Rude people wearing McDonalds uniformnormally their titles would be employeeworkers That may suggest they earned their wage
10744,1,Really poor mcdonalds  service is fast but they normally get the order wrong and arent as friendly as in new york restaurants
10745,1,Almost all tables were dirty bathrooms were gross there was a pair of dirty socks on the floor Food was good though but they need to improve on the cleanliness of their restaurant
10746,1,Came to Miami for vacation being here just wanted something quick They took forever to give us our food the dinning area was filthy and around 950pm I went back to order something else and the cashier was being rude and unprofessional denying me the service saying they were already closed and couldnt take anymore orders I would understand if I was outside but I was already inside and expending money W
10747,1,I feel bad writing this review  The workers seemed very confused one lady in the 15 minutes I spent in the location stood by the soda machine in a daze She wasnt even the one who gave us our drinks I would really like to find out what her purpose was The food came out cold with exception of fries The manager looked so frustrated I hesitated to return the order Terrible
10748,1,No restrooms The employees use them though so only customers cant Is that even legal to operate without restroom Most employee are rude and ignore you when you ask for ketchup or anything
10741,1,Bad experience bad grade thats the game The ordering machine does not issue a ticket to justify his order but especially his payment
10770,1,I cant give it less than 1 star otherwise I would have The staff have no idea what theyre doing they walk around gaumlessly offering no help The counter is like a mosh pit Nothing works Avoid if you can or hope its not busy at all otherwise youre in for a long wait with the wrong order by the end of it
10771,1,"My only visit to this shop and I witnessed these 1 There were two lines but suddenly one of the staff members stopped taking orders and closed the pointofsales machine  Those customers on that line were told to go at the back of the other line
2 I understand that some staff are new but the supervisor or senior staff are rude to the new staff and do not help train them  I dont understand the yelling probably because they are in Spanish
3 Majority of staff speak Spanish and announce numbers in Spanish  Expect some misunderstanding when they are taking your order too  One of the staff put in hot coffee when I ordered hot coffee
4 Be prepared to wait in a long line and always check your order before you leave the pick up counter  It was my fault that I did not checkrealize my Big Mac and South West salad dressing are missing when I felt

TLDR just dons will always be a bad decision anyway"
25697,1,They was loud and had attudes and hanging all out the window my food was cold this was a bad place to eat at
10794,1,Place was not noticeable based on the Google maps direction I ended up looking for a while for it because it is missing the iconic double arches people know I was looking within the mall area because of the map description and wished I was across the street as it would have been easier to see When I entered to place an order one of the cashiers had an upset look or scowling face towards most customers and unfriendly look I didnt like her look so I stepped to the next cashier and I ordered it was fast I ordered a Happy Meal and was asked if this is for a boy or girl assuming a toy choice here I get the order no toy And asked all they said was no toy sorry I left Im not surprised by the lower than usual reviews here Also when eating my food I ordered triple cheese burger but got doubles instead at least I was charged for double only
10822,1,Customer service sucks walk to counter to order my meal the Male cashier with 2inch painted fake finger nails was rude said something rude in spanish i dont care to repeat and walked away before i could place my order as if I wasnt good enough for him to take my order However he did have time to come into the lobby and joke around with other Hispanic guests I had to place my order with another cashier  who was sufficient My food was thrown into a bag and shoved at me by another crew member All of the food was cold and the sweet tea tasted of coffee grounds All of the tables were dirty and sticky Having dined in and watched this gross misconduct happen to several guest Having been a former Manager of a McDonalds it was a duty to share this experience with your company To be honest if this store was in any other location it would go out of business for extremely horrible customer service and filthy establishment If i had been a serect shopper or health inspector this location would have failed 
10796,1,I dont know where to start OMG This is the slowest MCDs restaurant in the world Staff act like if they were on vacation You can see in their faces that they hate working here and are just looking forward to the end of their shift Manager came out after a while and there was no improvement in performance The automated order system was not working so I waited in line for 10 mins just to order and pay From this point it was exactly 27 mins until my order was ready All that was was a bottle of water and a mocha coffee And I had to ask them otherwise it would have been more than half hour I reckon staff must really ask themselves whether they want to work here There may be other better places where they could find job satisfaction Here theyre just turning a bunch of people into unhappy customers
10821,1,"Seriously replace the entire staff or give them a training We had to wait for about 45 minutes for our order which was incomplete

 wrong drinks
 cold food
 no sauces
 no napkins alsno not available at the selfservice part
 employees arguing with each other
 employees are juist having conversations with Friends who are at the desk
 no structure in kitchen or frontdesk
 homeless people are sleeping inside the restaurant"
10798,1,Waited one hour for a 4 piece chicken nugget happy meal Disorganized unapologetic and zero customer service The kiosk machine for fast service was anything but that They lost my order and the manager didnt want to step up to admit so
10799,1,If I couldnt give a star I would because the service over there is poorly I order a salad and they did not give me a fork so I asked for 4 for one I was standing there for 3 minutes and then I asked her again for it and she told me no Worst service ever
10819,1,HORRIBLE SERVICE All employees look like they hate their jobs Most with headphones taking to whoever on them Cashier swearing at their coworkers and whoever they supposedly have on the phone Claim they are not talking to the customers but the people in their phones Took forever for just large fries and large sprite dirty interior No one is doing their job
10793,1,"AVOID The biggest disappointment about this restaurant is the total lack of servicemindedness of the staff They got our order wrong we ordered a dubble cheese burger and got a regular cheese burger instead and their solution was to take said burger and simply slap another patty in it before giving it back They also forgot to include items in our order like sauces and such and they couldnt give us a reciept after our purchase

When my friend asked one staff member for the sauces he ordered she only spoke spanish to him even though he made it clear that he didnt understand her After some time and finally getting the sauces the staff laughed as he left

At least the place was some what clean Seriously avoid there are a lot of better food places nearby"
10801,1,Absolutely the worst customer service Ive experienced in my 46 years I was in line waiting to order mind you the line was so long you would have thought they were giving food away and just as I get to the front of the line the cashier just walks away and says nothing  I wait about 5 minutes and ask is he returning to take orders and was told no we only have one line now The employees were rude the lines were unbelievably long and it took about 40 minutes to order and receive your foodTheMcDonaldsfromHELL
10804,1,The food is average here like all McDonalds nothing so bad like cold food or anything the bad part about this location is that it somewhat seems to be a safe haven for bums and schizophrenic drug addicts Everytime I have ever went here I am approached by someone asking for money or food  its ridiculous its like they all hide in there and come out to beg when a new customer enters Last time I was there a bum with an injured leg was high on crack or something and scratching his open wound with the gauze removed completely disgusting miami filthy 
10816,1,45 minutes waiting for a coffee they serve me the wrong one then the manager Marina came totally rude and aggresive to discuss that was what I ordered  I show how wrong she was but anyway she still rude and unprofessional  Bad  bad bad the worse place in South Beach
10815,1,50 cents for a water Screw that Rude employees and slow service Never had such a bad experience at a mcdonalds before It takes 45 min to get an ice cream cone They either need to get better employees or a bigger establishment
10807,1,This McDonalds is extremely busy and the service is terrible After waiting for over 10 minutes for my sundae I finally flagged down an employee and complained Then she made it Just a couple of hours previously I watched someone fill my drink order and put it on a counter where it was subsequently ignored by the other employees who were handing out orders for 5 minutes They have a computer system just like other McDonald
10808,1,Shocking the worst McDonalds ever The staff were dressed in their own clothes leant on the till ignoring customers and looked put out when having to serve They moved the slowest Ive ever seen a human move the were lethargic and made it clear they couldnt care less All of them Out of two orders they got both wrong Its a testament to McDonalds that their general standards are so high across the world in my experience that this terrible restaurant stands out as an exception Whoever does their quality audits needs sacking or spend more time there
10809,1,Rudest employees Ive seen anywhere Ive been Whomever is the manager and allows employees to act like this needs to be fired or maybe thats why they are stuck at McDonalds
10810,1,I walked away from my table and when I returned someone had drunk my coffee Straight outta the cupwhat a nerve While the cleaning lady was right there
10803,1,Fantastic service Came in around breakfast time and My wife was told that McDonalds doesnt have fries and continually asked if they would ever have fries and was told no fries Legit this was better than the comedy show I saw in the cruise before stopping by here Must see during yorr trip to Miami
10732,1,This place is RACIST They do what they want to do in there  The food is never fresh and the workers are very rude to the customers and when you have a problem with your food they tell you to leave and dont come back All the works and the managers are all 
10792,1,The service was terrible my order it wasnt complete and when we talk with the Manager he yell at us and touch our french fries with his dirty hands Thanks to the cuban lady who change our fres Dont Come to this place you 
10824,1,Great foodgreat locationentertaining rude employees and clothing is optionalFood works like a tasty laxativeyou are sure to go within two hoursCuban employee screams out the numbers in spanish while pregnant employee says Customer should turn gay because he is not picking Up  any of the female employeesAnother employee has a nasty cold and was mixing a lemon with hot waterAnother Customer was told by pregnant comedic employee  if he did not like their Service he should go eat on Ocean Drive
25695,1,I asked for a side of Big Mac sauce a did not receive any also I ask for large fries and got a small instead and to top if they assumed I spoke Spanish how rude
10774,1,This is the most horrible place I have been to A guy walked out as we walked complaining he had waited 10 minutes for a soda The guy on the register was so rude Very under staffed Homeless sleeping on the chairs We ordered 2 coffees and 2 frappes  and waited so long to get them all at different times I worked at one in NZ  and we would be fired for this kind of thing straight away
10775,1,If I could give this place 0 stars believe me I would By far the worst McDonalds I have EVER been to in the world I came in to buy a bottle of water would never even consider eating here given the lack of cleanliness I waited about five minutes until someone finally told me that they do not have any bottles left I told them a large fountain water was fine with ice Keep in mind  MAYBE 2 people at this McDonalds speak English Luckily this woman understood me when I communicated what I wanted I watched her get the cup fill it with ice and place it beside the machine For someone that is just waiting for a drink pour it and hand it to the customer There were maybe a dozen people waiting for their orders I did not have any other items to wait for  just the water I waited another 5 minutes to see if someone would just hand me the cup No one did I pushed my way through to the front and got my cup It was absolute chaos in there a brutally unorganized establishment The cashier could have simply turned around gotten me the bottle of water or in this case tell me there are none and pour me a fountain drink and be on my way Wasted 1015 minutes in this place
10831,1,Server got my order wrong and made no effort to correct it Said next and dismissed me very rudely Tried to talk to another server who barely spoke English and got the same service as the first The order that I did get was not at all fresh Overall worst McDonalds experience Ive had Not impressed and would not come back because of the rude workers
10777,1,So many crazy homeless people come into this establishment just to sit lounge and disturb customers McDonald
10828,1,Not one person working spoke hardly any English inquired about Santas Enchanted Forest coupons which was posted on the door no one could even answer me and said the didnt speak English I said how you have a job in the United States and not even be able to speak English and they just laugh at me It took at least 30 min to get a sweet tea this place is Seriously Screwed Up I will Definitely be calling customer service about my issues at this McDonalds
25687,1,Food was terrible My friend and I both threw up after a few bites  Ordered a coke and got a dr pepper
10791,1,When you want one of the main items on the list and they dont have it sock juice is better than the service in this location  How are these people even allowed to work here Plants are nicer I have been to McDonalds in 54 different countries and CONGRATULATIONS you are the WORST
10781,1,This was hands down the SLOWEST McDonalds I have ever been to in the whole world The kitchen was full of employees so Im not sure why they didnt have their act together
10783,1,I ordered a latte from the Miami Beach Lincoln road branch and waited for my drink I saw my number flash up on the screen but no one called me I went up and asked the woman short reddish hair who was calling out the order numbers if my number had been called The answer was no I kept waiting and still nothing I asked her again but I was rudely ignored due to her having a chat with her friend I asked several different people working there about my latte but they all said its coming and moved on The staff were either rude indifferent and just no longer interested in me after I had paid People came and went with their orders and I was left waiting for my one latte I said to one woman how long does it take to make a latte She looked at my ticket and of course no one had even started making it I was disgusted with the truly terrible customer service If u want good service do not go to this mcdonalds
10784,1,Went here for a late night snack stop on Uber back to hotel Shows 247 hours but the place was closed Ended up having to get two Ubers and pay twice as much as a result
10826,1,"Selfservice order is chaotic Only received 10 Nuggets instead of 20 Ordered sauces have been compeltely forgotten now for the second time we had to remind them Toilets were not clean
However food was as expected from McDonalds"
10786,1,Horrible service Ridiculous wait time Waited such a long time for an ice cream cone They have over 10 people working and yet theyre slow They have someone who prepares all drinks but by the time you get your food the ice in your drink has melted since it has become warmed
10787,1,Employees are rude service is terrible took half an hour for me to get my meal Supervisor was yelling at customers about putting trash in the bins I asked for a cup of water and the girl said we dont have water but I can give you ice Is ice what I asked for If you dont have water how are you washing dishes How are you washing your hands
10788,1,If I could give less starts I would do so Service is awful waited for the order for 30 mins  2 cheeseburger and coffee and finally got the food cold Can you image it Management team must be fired and new staff should be well trained prior starting working
10825,1,I went there two times with bad experiences Both time the automatic cashier was out of paper You are calling assistance to have your number of order and they dont care They serve your coffee black even of you asked to add cream in the order Looks
10782,1,"Hope you have a lot of time because the wait here is unbelievable placing an order alone took  me 15 minutes I work nearby and 5 out of 5 times Ive been here in the overnight time they
Werent serving coffee  any items on the value menu or any grilled items Not to mention how filthy it is Also always understaffed Horrible experience I dont usually eat McDonalds but working as an overnight around the area is one of the only places open has been like this for as long as I could remember Reason for this review is because its unacceptable that they dont have coffee or value menu items available at nighttime when they should Wish I could give it stars"
10731,1,Im really sorry that I don
10730,1,No interest in this location No testing foods
10844,1,THE DIDNT HAVE MY HONEY MUSTARD  SO THEY GAVE ME MUSTARD INSTEAD
10860,1,"Filthiest McDonalds Ive ever been to We visited twice at different times and it really is disgusting Not surprising though since its literally filled with homeless people sleeping Its like a shelter in here
Police came in and kicked several out but not all of them"
10674,1,The dirtiest McDonold I have ever been Waited for 8 mins with no one to serve even though 2 staffs were standing there and see me waiting The place is so dirty and I am not sure how they pass hygiene They do not allow to order medium only large at night One of my order was not in the bag When I checked the receipt I noticed they have placed a wrong order I told them about it they said they dont have the item and refused to give refunds when I told them I do not want the wrong order No apology and lie about I ever placed order they put in  Very rude and ignorant She did not speak English but deny about putting wrong order and accused me of placing order that I would never have placed Food was cold and bread was hard as burn Horrible experience with them and wish McD franchiser will take their license away It is a disgrace to the brand The management is so bad and I find the whole experience to be unbelievable Readck your order but best advice is NOT to go there at all
10675,1,Literally locked the door on my face I never write reviews but this was so strange Was attempting to purchase breakfast and there was an employee who physically pushed me out and locked the door Completely unwarranted given my calm demeanor Very bizarre
10676,1,"Hygiene is very bad  The cleaning lady  afroamerican women  today at 1415 was slow and unpleasant
The food looked like it was from the day before  Terrible dirt in the toilets  The macchiato was too hot  poorly frothed milk
Dirty place"
10677,1,The gentleman at the counter Said we dont have decafe I spoke to manager after 5 minutes of arguing and having been told I walked a long distance just for their Decafe they realized they have it and that the machine works what a way to start the morning 
10678,1,They do not know how to make a simple sandwich Avoid this place and spend a few more dollars somewhere else This is supposed to be a deluxe chicken sandwich but this is how it came
10679,1,Slow service Being ignored by tid crew when i tried to ask for some sugar they forgot to put in my coffee at one on my visits Very slow experience in 4 out of 5 visits
10672,1,Absolutely no employees speak English  We waited over 20 minutes on our food and had to utilize Google Translator for the employees to understand we had not received our order
10859,1,Staff are incompetent and the place is chaos No one knows where to go or stand  All the empty tables were dirty Food was rank as well Go and enjoy the local food like I should have
10682,1,They say theyre open 24 hours but theyre not I just d

10685,1,I was buying my breakfast and my phone was taking a while to download a promotion  in the app  I decided to order without a coupon then my phone downloaded the Promotion and I asked him to delete that order that I was going to order with a coupon he replied that he could not change anything and that he did not have time to change the order in a rude way and insulting me he took me out of the store
10686,1,Must invest in security staff hassled multiple times by persons not patrons of the restaurant to buy things Staff dont care and turn a blind eye to it
10687,1,This location is the worse The staff is not friendly  The quality control is lacking The place just smells like homelessness you can almost taste it in the air Ive brought my concerns to the attention of the management staff and no changes no one seems to care Today is my last day eating here which makes me sad because I love a good sweet tea and fries 31 rating is way to high dont believe me Read the comments below
10688,1,I cant seriously believe this place is still in business AND is supposed to represent brand McDonaldsI experienced one of the worst services ever from a restaurant whilst dining here  The staff basically are not interested in serving you they dont want to work Manager is not interested and rest rooms are permanently closedis this even legal It is telling that none of the staff wear their name badges I visited the premises on 5th July 2018 at 845am Seriously McDonaldsyou need to close this branch downyou cannot continue to offer service this bad under your company logo Service with a smile you sure dont get that here as one customer acknowledgedand on that note all the customers agreed I rest my case
10858,1,"No one speaks English here And the employees dont like people who speak only English obviously How is this place still in business I tried the selfservice order machine and theres no pager at all The counter ended up giving me the wrong order and charged me twice the money over the machine

Ahhh"
25734,1,They keep serving stale food and when you request fresh food they put your food in the microwave and reheat your fries I saw it with my own eyes
10861,1,Manager refused to refill my coffee Overall restaurant team members are rude I recommend going elsewhere I think manager has poor customer service skills Very disappointed at this location
25737,1,Got hit up by a beggar with 30 seconds of parking  Beggar then proceeded to move inside to converse with employees
10653,1,If I could  give them a 0 I would Were out of literally everything didnt add anything I asked to be added to my chicken sandwich noth
10654,1,Absolutely terrible quality control How anyone thinks this is ok to send to paying customers is mind blowing
10871,1,The staff doesnt speak english I used the kiosk and they were supposed to bring the food to our table that didnt happen My food was cold and stale i complained and was ignored for 5 min mainly because they didnt speak english No Good i would understand if the menu was in spanish but its in english dont you think that they people that aere serving you should understand the language the menu is in
10656,1,"Came on 06032023 at 10pm So many things were out of stock including Happy Meals McChicken and HotSpicy McChicken smaller portion of nuggets only from 10pieces large fries but no medium etc Why  Lack of packaging 

Came there with a toddler Pretty sad

But the worse to come Never ever be disappointed with the taste of the fries Ok Those can be sometimes old McDonalds products are fresh for 10 minutes only Fries were mushy and the taste was nasty Same nasty taste on the nuggets"
10657,1,Rude customer service Some people should get fired They make threats And put spit in the food I had a traumatized experience here they put spit in my food and sent people to follow me all the way back to my hotel room saying theyll put spit in my food again Worst place to eat at
10658,1,Stayed downtown stopped for sandwich and coke Coke machine was broken homeless all over the lobby bathrooms had homeless in and out with obvious drug use Employee was too worried about the bathroom door lock and messed up a 2 sandwhich order Manager quickly fixed Typical big city overpriced trashy fast food place Felt like I was back in New York City
10870,1,"I would give it 5 if I could
Total DISGRACE to McD brand
We placed an order and paid at the selfserve kiosk Receipt did not print out Took our order  in vain hope of seeing the food No such luck You need to push yourself through the crowd at checkout counter to wait for order to come out After 10 minutes we heard quatro screamed out by an employee  That could have been our order except it was missing few pieces and none of the employees at food handout desk spoke any English to understand what I was telling them NONE  And my Spanish was not good enough to get the point t across either
I went back in line waited another 10mins to speak to a woman taking orders manually who had to ask for an English speaking manager to troubleshoot our order  Eventually order was remedied handout employee was instructed in Spanish how to fix our order which she did finally handing food to us with a farewell message of go cuno
You can lookup what that means or avoid our mistake and NEVER go to this McD at all costs"
10863,1,Very bad service too long to wait for your order 15 minutes for 1 latte really guys Almost no customers but dirty tables and restroom which has no soup and hand dryer isnt working Both of them Shame

THEY ALWAYS FORGET OR CONFUSE PUTTING SAUCES IN YOUR FOOD

Yesterday we went there ordering the 40 McNuggets with 2 fries deal We selected four different sauces When we unpacked the stuff at the beach we found they gave us only 2 instead of 4 sauces And these were 2 ranch while we ordered different sauces Also we got just 1 instead of 2 fries Next day we ordered a happy mal and again the nuggets sauce was missing as well as the ketchup I cant wrap my head around how employees can be so incompetent The guys responsible for packing the sauces should be taught a lesson"

10714,1,"Hello

I hope this email finds you to inform you that your staff needs to be engaged in coaching due to the lack of attention to a female and I needing to use the restrooms after multiple attempts to utilize them I was ignored by the first female and was given a puzzled look that they cant be opened After I went around to seek attention from the other staff she rudely stated both bathrooms are not available after I asked why she said  they just are  I asked to see what would cause them to be unusable but could only feel discriminated as she added no urgency to the issue She then asked if I was management to even request to see the inside of the bathrooms As a LONG TIME CUSTOMER I suggest to keep your client based loyal to address this issue as it leaves a bad image on the franchise I left feeling I didnt have it my way  And thats just a bowl movement Thank you for your time and I hope this matter has been addressed the next time I pass by the store as I will try to obtain pictures of the staff reluctant to assist

Best regards

10712,1,"McDonalds excels at friendly service and inexpensive but good quality food This franchise has none of that The staff was efficient enough but distant and surly I had two meals there Both times my food was too cold to eat

One problem may be the groups of loud and rude teenagers that hang out there The backs from a long banquette are missing leaving wood laths that poke the back

All of that is unfortunate because this franchise has a perfect location to shine"
25713,1,Stop by here February 16 in the morning at 600 am I waited 20 minutes and they gave me the wrong order in the end they have no service and I asked for sauces for my food and they didnt have what kind of store is this
10722,1,Terrible service I put in curbside pickup for the mobile order Waiting for nearly half an hour A staff walked out and said I cannot park here for more than 15 minutes and this is for curbside pickup only I explained and showed the receipt that I put in as curbside pickup She still did not look and proceeded to tell me I am wrong Terrible service
10723,1,The restaurant was very dirty the order was incomplete and my daughter was sad because she didnt receive her Happy Meals toy Additionally we ate as fast as possible because there was a homeless intimidating the guests and the employees didnt do anything We felt very insecure eating there

10728,1,The worst McDonalds to go tothe Fries look like they just heated them up and servednot even cool throughlysuper lazy peopleand have a lot of attitudedo not go here
10845,1,I had a security guy who works at this McDonalds ask me to leave as I was enjoying my egg McMuffin coffee and reading  The idiot said youve been here more than 30 minutes and need to leave  I told him to not be rude and to pound sand he didnt like that  Never in my life have I been treated like that or spoken to like that while sitting in any restaurant after paying let alone a crummy disgusting and badly staffed McDonalds with rude employees  To top it all off my order was messed up and so was this elderly mans order  A disgrace of a McDonalds should be shut down IMMEDIATELY
10856,1,"The food was cold we never got our drinks or ice creem the manager was so rude he thought u got u drinks after your food but we did not get our drinks at all even after waiting about a hour This place sucks do not EVER go hear un less u like bad service and terrible food

10711,1,How can they have about 20 employees behind the counter and run into stock issues Everything is sold out Poor management I say
10709,1,"A horrible McDonalds restaurant Its dirty service was bad strange people walk in and out all the time overall the place looks out dated It seemed that they blocked some of the cheaper items from the menu around diner time for example they did not serve the Happy meal with 4 pieces of chicken nuggets That one was out of stock although the did sell the Happy meal with 6 pieces chicken nugget What a joke
If you look for a nice place to eat with your kids go somewhere else"

Again missing the sauce for the Mc nuggets  Not only I am paying for them as they are part of my menu and the mc nuggets are pretty disgusting with no sauce whatsoever Since this is a recurrent missing item at each order I have a question
Is it the food cost monitoring or a real operation issue 
May be have them put by the person packaging the mc nuggets instead of the cashier"
25862,1,Horrible service Alot of items on menu not available for 24hr drive through

10258,1,What a rippoff  I order a quarter pounder  There was no lettuce  Looked like a small cheese burguer   Ugly French fries  In Canada I could eat a better meal than this
10259,1,If i could give them 0 starts i would they messed up my order and then when i took it back it took them another 10 min to re do it Plus i was waiting for my order the first time for like 610 min it was thru drive thru Not satisfied at all
25621,1,this is my second time going through drive thru in the same person gave me my food with an attitude if u do not like your job dont work on 3292019 0730pm
11083,1,Take for ever to bring you food slow services Im not recommend this restaurant
10262,1,"Fries under cooked
Chicken nuggets over cooked  always messing up my order and this us 4th time never coming back just horrible service"
10246,1,Homeless people harass you while at the drive thru to buy them food Very sad situation
10245,1,"If I could I wouldnt even give one star to this location  employees are very rude and disrespectful I dont understand how they get away by not getting discipline 
They need a huge training on customers satisfaction skills otherwise they should look for a different kind of work where they dont have to be seen to avoid their behavioral issues at the workplace"
11089,1,I overheard the man standing at the window outside because it wouldnt open the door for people to eat inside to say if the people out there
11090,1,The place was very slow Tables not cleaned Recycled unused ketchup pouches instead of throwing away
25991,1,This is the worst Mc Donalds that I have ever visited Sadly this is the only one which is near my home and sometimes I dont have options to chose another one but today was the last straw I made an order through the app and selected the pickup at the Drive Thru but when I got to the screen where we should order the girl who was there didnt know what to do with my Order Code and when I got to the window and ask for it they didnt know anything neither and they pretended that I went inside because they do not dispatch mobile order by there Also told me that the payment had not come through and I requested to cancel the order but 3 minutes later I was charged with the order that I never got so Im  making this complain because I am pretty upset and disappointed because I always eat in Mc Donalds but in this store is always the same disgusting and poor service at all time or unless when I have gone mornings and nights Also I disputed the charge you made to my credit card because as you noticed I never got it
10226,1,Do not go to this McD so nasty I dont understand how anyone can eat inside this place it smelled like rotten fish We paid 25c to get in the restroom which its fine because there are some many homeless out side they want to keep them from using them even though they were also dirty they did not smell  as bad as the  dinning So we went in used rr n leftgross Outside this guy chased us to our car asking for money
25990,1,The worst experience  Staff and management ignored the customers Talked to each other  Took 10 minutes to order  Then 10 minutes to get my food  No apology  Management watched and said nothing during this whole ordeal  Total rude and unprofessional
10228,1,Sad to say the slightest customer service I got here was from the security guard food here is horrible servercashier need to be fired get ignore for the talk to among their selves than act like working but just standing aroundIve gave better customer service when Ive worked at a McDonalds beforeThis just my experience nothing can change my mind to ever to come back to this location again
25988,1,I placed my mobile order they made me wait 30 minutes in the drive thru before I could get my food this is a dump Always a ht show there
25987,1,What a joke Parking is awkward went and asked for breakfast  they were out of muffins Okay asked me to wait a few minutes theyll start lunch at 1030 Come up there at 1030 on the dot  they tell me they wont serve lunch until 10451050 because they still have breakfast food left I didnt know the cashiers decide when to serve lunch now
11096,1,Workers  very sloppy in serving  food to customers  they walking around  while the  food sit there getting COLD and act like  we are bothering them for serving  us  all these attitudes workers  need  to give up the job to someone   who have better  customer service representation
10264,1,Im giving it a 1 star because i bought a lot of burgers and fries and they only gave me 2 ketchups I asked for more ketchup the worker said they cant give more it was  mcdonalds  rules  MCdonalds is making it hard to enjoy these burgers and fries with no ketchup
10232,1,I do not like this place me and my two grandchildren went to eat and  we asked if we can please get the table clean and they took 10min to 25min just to clean the tables we kept asking them but they did not clean the tables we asked for it to go because they were working slow than we get the fries bured we said hey can we get fries the are cooked 100 they said sorry all we have is burned fries we had wait even more longer to get our fresh fries
11095,1,By far the worst McDonalds Ive ever been to  Food was gross and the place is dirty  Save yourself and dont come here
25985,1,Never again clueless manager with no management skills or understanding that you aid where your employees lack because she just stood there during the holdup Never again
10236,1,The absolute worst McDonalds Ive ever been to And Im not one to complain Every time Ive been through the drivethru Ive had to wait nearly 30 minutes for my food And every time Im speaking into the drive thru window the person taking my order needs to repeat my order to me several times due to the language barrier On top of that I attempted to go eat instore about 20 minutes ago and found that the lobby was already closed The lobby was not to be closed until 9 pm and they closed it about 30 minutes prior I have not had any positive experiences at this particular McDonalds Corporate needs to do something about this location
10237,1,Worst service ever Took 35 minutes to get through the drive through and both window 1 guy  window 2 girl gave me attitude Window 1 couldnt get my order right and their drive through screen didnt display my simple order And then Window 2 lady gave me the wrong sauce EVEN AFTER CONFIRMING WHAT I ASKED FOR WITH HER Fire all of them shut down this location and board up the building Do it now
11093,1,Worst McDonalds Ive ever been to Service is horrible and the food was worst I dont recommend it theres other fast food restaurants in the area
10240,1,They got my whole order wrong even after we corrected them they still purposely messed up the order leaving out some ingredients One of the employees told me that everyone was mad because they have to go to another store to pick up their checks Don
25983,1,Customer service here always at its worse I get that they probably dont get paid enoughbut they dont seem to realize that theyre not giving good customer service You get what you give 
10233,1,"Worst McDonalds Ive ever been to Every time I go there I Feel as though I am being judged because I decide ro walk to it after I get out or work after 10pm They are very rude and never plesejt nor fonthey saybtyank you or have manora what so ever I was flat out refused service one time because I walked to this place and needed to go through the drive through
I have a perfectly working car but use that time to exercise by walking down there
Im also asked at least twice before and twice after I get my food for money every single time I to there by people asking for a hand outs Its very uncomfortable That is not an exaggeration either Cant the security who work there try protecting your customers from being harassed instead of being on their cell phone all the time
You guys are literally my last option when it comes to getting some thing to eat around where I live because of how uncomfortable it is to go there Theres a lot of people who avoid this place for those reasons too Im defiantly not the only one"
25623,1,I used to not have issues with the location I went to last night but in recent months they have been giving me the wrong order or not giving me my whole order amd when I went last night the night employees came off like they hated their job and didnt care about customers
11080,1,came here after a road trip at about 11pm the food was GROSS

25962,1,I live 150 feet away and waited an hour to place an order This is supposed to be fast food Never had a more disappointed experience with McDonald
25961,1,They have the worst manger ever One of them have a lack of speaking which is Arlene Ledesma She doesnt know what is being said to her You cant get your point across because she wont understand  Cant handle the  customers and shes very disrespectful
25959,1,no stars this is the worst ever service i have ever encountered 28 minutes in the drivethru I asked for a refund and the managers name and they refunded me my money and decline to give me the food I ask the manager for her name and she walks away at the end i got my food for free but perhaps a better management team needs to come in and train cus these young women that were there yesterday 623 around 2pm were exchanging snapchat videos and chitchatting like they didnt have 810 cars in the drive thru
25958,1,This McDonalds needs to close Ive ordered 15 times in 6 months and had 1 correct order Dont order delivery go yourself and check the bag before you leave
10295,1,Horrible order on mobile app and it charged my card when  ho too pick up General Manager says they never got the order then I cancel it and reorder it does the same then never got anything if I can give then a no star I would
10296,1,I assume you need a high school diploma to work at McDonalds But this place never gets the order right Asked for two iced coffees One with sugar and the other without I got 2 coffees with no sugar And top it off no straws Thanks McDonalds for making it harder for us so you can get your 15 an hour Geeesh Loouuiiies you guys should ve getting paid 8 an hour No questions asked

11064,1,Food was cold and of course the milkshake machine was brokenagain
25950,1,Do NOT go to this McDonalds if youre in a hurry We were just picking up a drink so it wasnt a problem but ordering was chaos and there was a guy beside us who had seriously been waiting 35 min for his chicken sandwich He showed us the receipt showing when he ordered and was trying to ask the staff what was happening and they were quite rude and just said man you can see we busy Also note that this was the only McDonalds we encountered in Florida that doesnt offer 1 any size soft drinks
11062,1,The worse Mc Donald Ive ever been Under staffed and confusion to get your food right Far away from companys minimum standard
25957,1,Drive thru cashier completely got my order wrong  She order what she saw on register and not what I wanted  Then look surprised when I told her  The manager should not let her work drive thru Which explains why the line was so long  Im sure Im not the only order she screwed up Dont normally post these comments  but its becoming more of the norm these days

11077,1,Ordered over the app Came here while it was raining and they were closed
25964,1,"Biscayne Blvd and 35th Street
Based upon what I observed and experienced at the drivethru window with 4 employees one who couldnt even understand or speak English I made a complaint to McDonalds yesterday and will wait to hear from someone with the franchise owners organization  The owner needs to know how poorly managed this restaurant is and how inadequately the employees are trained to do their jobs  I also have contacted and submitted a written complaint to Chris Kempczinski CEO of McDonalds as well as Steve Easterbrook who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of McDonalds in Chicago  They need to understand why McDonalds is doing so poorly afterall when they have to communicate to their Board members and investors about a drop in multiple quarterly revenues and earnings over the past year maybe then they will take a look at how poorly they select train and manage their employees to create a positive customer experience with stellar service I will not be going to this or any other McDonalds again  It was that bad  McDonalds corporation needs to do a thorough investigation of how this restaurant is NOT being properly managed by the franchise owner and managers  The owner clearly must put numbers before people  Horrible horrible experience  Will stick with Wendys instead  They have much better food and service

04052021  As a followup to my complaint to McDonalds 1800 and the CEO I did receive a written response and phone call  Kathy was very appreciative of the feedback received and thorough in her explanation of actions taken as a result of a completed investigation  I was also compensated for the experience I had at this McDonalds  I will add that although I had been to this McDonald"
25965,1,For the third time in the morning this is happened to me the drivethrough lady does not answer I drove around the front this morning and they had about four employees there looking at me  One of them gave me a thumbs up to go back to the drivethrough which I did and it was the same result the lady did not answer and finally I decided I would leave and right before I left she answered by saying one moment please so I waited hey moment and she still was not ready so I just left  There have been two vehicles in the drivethrough before me that had also left and I did not understand why until my experience I believe the employees are slacking off in the morning which is difficult for me because if I dont have breakfast then I have to wait 6 12 hours at work before they allow me to go eat 
10277,1,I sat in the dining room before ordering any food for 5 minutes to catch my breath after walking 5 miles Security guy approached me saying  hey man  if you want to sit in here you need to buy something right now if not u need to go back the way you just came Guess what Im the one who decides what when and where do I buy something

11074,1,Worst McDonalds in South Beach asked for some water and she said we don

25993,1,"The self service kiosks need to go CUSTOMER SERVICE is lacking because of them When you prefer to speak to a live person its as if youve inconvenienced them They do not listen while your ordering and have to repeat your order like 3x I asked for an iced caramel macchiato and was asked if I wanted it hot or cold ICED then was asked what flavor CARAMEL

10171,1,Hate having to come to this place the staff is quick but they allow people to aggressively beg for money food anything they can say the drive thru sign and all throughout the parking lot of you dont roll down your window which u have to eventually bc is a drive thru They will come to your car and they will knock on your window as is you might not be able to hear them or know they are there already should not be allowed   At all

10161,1,If you ever order at from location to go check that you received everything you ordered This is the closest location to where I live so we order often from here and its always the same problem missing items from our order I guess the best way to get everything youre paying for is to dine in maybe that way you can tell them right away that they forgot the items you paid for

I spent an hour in the drivethru and when I got to the window it took 10 minutes before anyone even came to the window and when they did they had no idea what I had ordered

I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest  in what they were doing It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion it was a sight to see

Then when I finally did get my food the order it was of course not correct But the weird thing is they didnt short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries

I am just visiting and will never go there again anyways but "

25918,1,Was basically out of half the menu Then we had them repeat back our 56 dollar order to us twice and once we got back to our hotel 2 sandwiches were missing While paying with my card through the drive thru the cashier said I had to give her my pin number because the pad didnt reach out the window Ive NEVER had something like that happen to me anywhere in my life Not a single employee had on a uniform Just a total messed up experience

25921,1,If you like to have your order messed up having people mumbling at you and dont care about getting any sauce with your nuggets this place is for you The crack heads hanging out in the drive through is also a nice touch although based on my experience those might just be workers on their break Oh and the fries  so old and stale they would make a great

11027,1,Its supposed to be a fastfood place but after 10 min not one food order has been served  The employees are standing around not doing anything while many many people are waiting for their orders One customer asked if any food at all will come out soon and did not even receive an answer Don
25919,1,We wait in the line for over 20 min When we arrive 2 employees were outside the store speaking The worst drive thru service ever
25922,1,Terrible In line for over an hour and my whole order was messed up First they told me over the drive thru intercom that they dont do the coupon on the app then told me to pull around after taking my order Make matters worse was the one worker kept scratching her hair her hoody on her head then take it off and scratch hair again Not once did she wash her hands but had the nerve to be mad at me because your coworker didnt ring up the order correctly Definitely will not be coming back to this one Im glad Im on my way back home to Texas so I can get some Southern Hospitality
14979,1,They are super slow around this time of day Avoid
26559,1,Ehhhhhhhhh
9434,1,"Sorry Old fryoil gave the nuggets a bad taste The level of  chlorine in the water made the Coke taste bad tasted chlorine  and the cheeseburger were cold a soft
The only good was the french fries"
26998,1,Food was terrible and it seems every homeless person in LA was in the parking lot or in the restroom
24875,1,I received a red raw Quarter Pounder at this location on 6292022  The order taker did not understand me when I said I had a mobile order code   Though the contents of my order were accurate my burger tasted weird and when I looked I observed it to be actually raw  The photo below is unfiltered and unretouched  Its upside down because I tossed it that way in my plate   It was terrifying   I called immediately  and was requested to come back with my receipt which the manager did refund JUST the burger part of my order   I really cant get over it  Just a word of warning before you go to this particular location  It was disgusting and disastrous
12323,1,Just dont like McDonalds
8485,1,Worst McDonalds experience to date  Attempted to use drivethru code at time of order and was refused Placed our order that would include the discount when code was applied Pulled up to the window to a frumpy redheaded clown of an employee that promptly slammed the card reader through my window with nigh a word I asked to have our discount code applied and he begrudgingly got his scanner out to read the QR code but he had wrung the order up incorrectly so the discount was not applying He requested assistance from his manager and their solution was to add a second premium drink to the order at an up charge All staff came across dower and melancholy Even when I commented that I was concerned about the accuracy and that this had been a terrible experience I was ignored I dont know if they beat their employees on a regular basis to keep sll ever go back to this location again
8486,1,Bathrooms were absolutely disgusting tampons on the ground before you walk into the building just really dirty
24878,1,Order for mobile pick up Checked in and waited at the pick up spot for 15 mins Went inside and food was sitting there without delivering
8489,1,Can not even order food they were not even incompetent enough to make an order
8490,1,I dont know if they all hate their job but this was probably THE worst location Ive been to One they didnt have my order correctly after telling them we were missing items they looked at me as if I was stupid Second their frie

8496,1,I didnt get a chance to try it Went to pick up some McDonalds from this 24hour location at 300 am but no one would respond at the drivethru speaker When I drove up to the window the two gentlemen inside acted like they couldnt see me I honked and waved my arms and it was clear that they could see me but they would not acknowledge my presence Totally unacceptable and unprofessional If youre under staffed or closed put a sign on the door or at the drivethru
8498,1,If you order at the desk you feel like theyre bothered They dont display any type of customer service at all When I get a mcflurry they dont mix it or even fill it anywhere near the top Steer clear

8478,1,The truth is that I feel offended by the Mananger he yelled at me as if I were his employee  I really dont understand I just asked him a question about an order that is already prepared and ready  and he doesnt deliver it to me because he doesnt feel like it I work as a delivery person for DoorDash Its ridiculous to have to stand in line at the drive thru to get something thats already done really 0 star  I work every night at that site and I have never had a problem with any of the cographers everyone is friendly and professional
8477,1,Expect to wait 1520 min for drive thru Recieved our sweet teas at the window and it had a bit of coffee taste The person at the window sampled the tea and said it tastes like tea NOT to us Seemed very frustrated She asked us what we would like I told her Dr pepper and before I could tell her the rest of the drink order she rushes off and gets us 3 dr peppers Then when we corrected her she said we asjed for 3 dr peppers This is my burger without onions and pickles What you see on my fingers is grease from the burger Good luck getting your food here

8463,1,The store was filthy Employees were using profanities in the back where customers upfront could hear Two female employees were playing on there phone What a horrible experience
24870,1,Manager stops doing uber eats after 4am so he wasted my time and gas that I wont be getting back Dont do eats here youll be disappointed
8465,1,"Went to pick up a mobile order at 345AM Only option was to go through drive thru I arrived and the drive through staff said they were closed despite the app and website saying they are a 247 location

I paid in full through the app and they said I wouldnt receive a refund for an hour I asked for the refund immediately and the clerk ignored me Upset that they"
8501,1,This has to be the worst McDonalds The food is never hot and never fresh  I went there again tonight since its the only place open   The fries were warm and tasted like they had been cooked in an air frier and the burger was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for hours   This places stays pretty busy so there is no excuse for poor quality of food imo   Avoid unless its your only option
8466,1,Lobby Hours 8 am whenever they feel like locking the doors I showed up at 710 pm FIFTY MINUTES BEFORE SCHEDULED CLOSING TO ALL THE DOORS LOCKED I am on foot because Im staying at a nearby hotel WALKED THROUGH FREEZING RAIN In hopes of just getting something quick and going back to my hotel THANKS FOR WASTING MY TIME

8474,1,literally didnt give me my order then made me wait over 40 minutes to fix it
8475,1,This is the worst McDonalds Ive ever experienced Your late night manager literally slammed the door in my face and locked 
8467,1,I was at this location on 2523 Went through the drivethru and the lady taking order was a little rude  I drove off and went inside Omg the expo person was standing there drinking a soda as shes bagging  food One of the cooks had so much hair even  though  he had on a hat he needed a hair net as well Went to get my drink and I quickly changed my mind to a bottle of water The drink station sickened me I dared not get ice or a drink from there Wont  be back Im sure you dont care Most disgusting
8502,1,Next time Ill just tell them to suprises me they never get my order right anyway 
12313,1,Cold food long waits
8504,1,Says its 24 hours and was turned away at about 3 am Dont say you are 24 hours if you are not a 24 hour location What do you not understand about being a 247 location
24891,1,Cashier couldnt understand me and when asking about an item they had on the board she said they didnt have that No please no thank you Order was not quite right as it often isnt Nobody follows instructions Please retrain staff
24892,1,Worse mcdonalds ive been to in a very long time You guys are lucky a lot of customers are looking for a cheap meal on vacation otherwise you would be out of business
24894,1,1 hour ago at 11pm we had 4 people came to the restaurant but all doors were locked We rang the bell and one of the staffs pointed his hand to show us to the drive thru We came there to wait about 15 minutes and no one answered us even though no one were in front of us and couples cars behind in line We let a car behind came before us and she got no response too Terrible service
26980,1,"Bed service very bad manager
He"
8532,1,Well earlier today I placed 2 separate orders but when I arrived there doors were locked there was no letter or any sort of notice explaining why but what confuses me more is they had people inside ordering and sitting down inside not happy with that location
8533,1,OK I guess I need to stop going to ANY Mcdonalds  Was in a hurry and ordered a double cheese and a small order of fries  They have two pickup windows and I watched both windows handing out food  So when the line moved up I drove to the furthest window  and sat and sat and watched 4 other cars pick up their food at the window behind me   a good 5 minutes passed and I backed up to the window where the food was being handed out and the person basically THREW the food at me without a word  10 steps 10 steps to bring me my food or something but nothing  And then  the fries were cold and the bun on the burger was stale   You get what you pay for and you get what you deserve if you go to a Salt Lake McDonalds
24896,1,Did the drive thru today 08222020 approx 1115 am the drive through attendant who I can only describe as a heftier young man was rude when I asked for a burger in my daughter happy meal Not to mention I specifically asked for no onions Not paying attention to my order on the screen I drove up only to find the lady trying to hand me 4 large ice teas in addition to my regular order Confirmed on the receipt that I was charged I was not willing to wait for further fumbling about for 4 I said dont worry about it dont want the teas and dont care about the 4 I get home AND MY DAUGHTERS HAMBURGER IS OVERFLOWING WITH ONIONS Terrible customer service terrible attention to detail terrible experience
8526,1,Worst experience ever First the cashier gave me attitude about using the app for the 1 large fries he sighed when I showed it to him Then said in a rude tone that I need to show him the bar code in the past I just show them the number and they type it in Then literally rolled his eyes when I told him it was Apple Pay and said whatever Then stared at me after taking the Apple Pay so I figured I would get the receipt at the next window I pulled up to the next window and they told me the other guy has thrown the receipt away Got home looked to see how much I was charged and he did not apply the app discount to the fries  My fries that I had ordered well done  both large and medium were cold and soft I live a block away the nuggets were old and the cheeseburger bun was not soft I was there today a Sunday at 6 pm  dinner time things shor charged for cold not fresh food
8535,1,I ordered on mobile Came to the McDonalds to pick up 50 minutes in the drive through By the time I got my food it was all cold Wasted my money They told me the wait was so l

8543,1,This restaurant is advertised as 24 hours I waited over 10 minutes in the drive through with at least 5 other cars only to have no response from the speaker Then they shut the lights off and still no communication Staff was seen inside working but no attempt was made to tell waiting customers that they were refusing to serve them
8544,1,Only the drive through is open 24 hrs Walk in only open until 8 pm
8545,1,Was missing the hash browns from my meals which made my 12 hr drive back to Canada v v sad

8507,1,They have the worse customer service and there food is never fresh Even if you ask for fresh food they still give you non fresh food and they have the ugliest attitude
8508,1,If you going to close the lobby despite being listed as open 24 hours at least dont ignore people walking up to order at the drive thru on foot

24888,1,"I ordered and CLEARLY STATED that I wanted two sandwiches four hash browns and two ice coffees They only put me for one coffee I told them I ordered two so they charge me for the other coffee
I ask for my extra coffee they were confused and said that they ordered me an extra sandwich so they had to fix that and refund me and gave me my 2nd coffee I finally thought It was fixed so when I left and got to my destination I realize this INUTILE a cashier only ordered me one hash brown instead of four Moral of the story McDonalds either train your cashiers right or buy new equipment because a simple order shouldnt have taken me more that 10 minutes of my day

24772,1,I am so tired of these franchises ripping off customers and upscaling the prices on items that are supposed to be a dollar McDonalds just needs to take down this 1 2 3 deal It seems as if every McDonalds I go into now is ran by either Hoodrats or Morons that are unable to perform their job duties
24807,1,Epic McDonalds on International dr Is lacking customer service  Had the coupon for free Happy Meal from Visit Florida  They didnt want to give it to us because we downloaded from site and printed not from tourist booklet  Then said it was not actually for a happy meal  Just drink fries and burgernuggets  No box toy yoghurt or toy  even though the coupon stated HAPPY MEAL  no small print  Girl at drive thru wasnt nice  Prices at epic McDonalds are quite a bit higher than the other locations and no 123 menu

I do not recommend this place at all rather they should close it I have gone several times at 2am to place my orders and they simply say that the menu they have is for breakfast and they never want to take out my order when I go at that time and likewise with Uber eats orders This place is really not worth it very disappointed in the services of all the McDonalds staff who work there they shouldnt have people like that"
24842,1,Fine in the morning go at night and the staff were terrible  rude unhelpful lots of food not available  I really thought the lady serving us was on some sort of go slow medication  if we hadnt already paid for the food and the kids were moaning that were hungry the server would have been wearing the food

8425,1,The worst Mac Donald I have ever visited in my life the treatment of the staff towards the customers is totally despicable you practically have to get the words out of it why they look at you and talk to you with contempt the food took 34 minutes exactly when the food finally arrived it was completely cold they didnt give me glasses they didnt put napkins they didnt put sauce Not to mention the workers inside yelling at each other A I almost forgot a client returned some hamburgers because it was not as he had ordered them they opened them they took out the vegetables and returned it to him that is not allowed

8665,1,We went on Friday night around 1130 and it was slow We waited in like for 20 minutes then waited for our order and even to get to the window for thirty minutes The people on the window and intercom were beyond rude like i understand youre busy but you DO NOT need to be rude to your customers reguardless how busy you are
26920,1,Night service suck and manger has an attitude During the day No problems
26917,1,Avoid it if you can The service is terrible some employees need to go back to training to enhance their costumer service skills
8670,1,This place is slloowwwwww
26915,1,Long line in drivethru Machine not working for atm or credit card Very sad for such a huge company
8675,1,They forget everything and charge you for it
24995,1,Manager is no good fire him
8677,1,"Called to confirm I could order using the app and walk up to pick up my order as I am staying at a hotel nearby Other McDonalds just bring it to you outside the door when the lobby is closed

They just hung up on me and kept the phone off the hook Wow  now thats customer service they won"
8678,1,They mixed up my order in the drive thru with someone elses and gave me the wrong food I guess thats what I get for not checking my bag until I drove 20 minutes home and for eating at McDonalds in the first place
26913,1,Very very slow took a long time be completed  unorganized but were very nice employees
8680,1,Do not go here My family came here on Christmas Eve and had the worst experience We stayed at a hotel and wanted some nice hot chocolate and cookies and the cookies were hard as a rock and the hot chocolate was disgusting It was hot water with peppermint On top of it the customer service was awful They refuse to take your order and make you do it on their machines If u have questions too bad We went back three times and they still got it wrong Just save your time and do not go here
8681,1,"PLAN TO BE UNWELCOMED 15 Mar 2020 pm
I expect to be treated with basic common courtesynothing moreand especially nothing less

I have had customer service issues with this McDs franchise before and have taken issues  to the managersTonight I became livid
I
parked my rented scooter along the side of the building like Ive done for the last year with no problemTonight a large black security guard got out of his car and yelled across the lot that I couldnreep moving on he had gone inside by this timeIt was not the words though gruffly spat but his tone and his pompous condescending attitude towards me
I continued to the front parked the scooter AGAIN and went straight to the manager to vent my complaint about the treatment I had receivedInitially the complaint was well and openly received by a young demur manager on duty and she apologized for the treatmentI also explained that I lived in the area frequented this McDs and that I would rather inconvenience myself and go an additional mile and a half to Burger King than spend one dime at this McDive change in their employees or the DistrictCorporate BigWigs are allowing this to happenThe lack of customer service and concern is appallingespecially for a name like McDonaldsI stormed out and left in disgust

AdviceDont expect to be treated like a valued customer"
8684,1,Was craving a breakfast sandwich but they stopped selling those all day Then I shifted to a chicken sandwich but they only sell the spicy version now Sadly I drove away with no food
12172,1,Received wrong food and waited 20 minutes in drive thru line
8663,1,This McDonalds is a joke What they fail to mention on their hours of operation is at Midnight is that they are not able to take any Orders because their system is updating for at least 45min Never heard of any other McDonalds closing down just to update It would be nice if they stated that on google so people dont waste their time and gas for nothing
12188,1,Service was ok but place smelled like sewage
8661,1,Im sorry But half the people working here dont have a clue whats going on 98 of the time I come here they forget something Its unbelievable No other fast food chain has as many issues as any McDonalds does Blows my mind And these people want raises Learn how to do your job if you want a raise
8659,1,I was staying next door at the hotel and decided to stop in for breakfast sandwich and the sandwich was nasty wasnt cooked But my 1 reason for the one star is the way the manager spoke to her worker in front of customers this was on 9232019 I was like WOW really Talk to people the way you would want to be spoken to If you want to be rude talk to the person in the back But otherwise learn to be a better manager that was unacceptable
8642,1,Went to eat there tonight and no one was there It says that you guys are open 24 hours drive thru only but no one was there at the kiosk or at the windows So please update your business hours
8643,1,Man This Location Sucks So Bad
8644,1,Honestly idk who runs this place But the turnaround time is patheticcccc Like I get is McDonalds The expectations are low But this place routinely has the longest wait time I
8645,1,"Since I work graveyards I unfortunately have to rely on McDonalds for food sometimes I recently started trying to come here since the 7th east location is no  longer open 24 hours Every time theyve been closed for cleaning If youre going to close update your hours so I dont waste my time driving all the way to you only to have to drive all the way to 2100 south

Maybe you should stop paying starvation wages and youd be able to hire an extra hand to help clean lol"
26926,1,Could barely get through the line to park spaces are way to small and waited 22 minutes to get two coffees
8647,1,Order mcdoubles and chicken nuggets and fries for my kids Burgers were dry like they had been under heat or light for too long I mean sand dry Fries were stale not freshly prepared Was beyond disappointed you work hard to make money twenty something dollars wasted on bad quality food beyond disappointed is an understatement I wont be coming back to this location
8648,1,Watch out for the homeless people in the drive through Shirtless guy will walk right up to your window and tell you to go F yourself if you dont buy him food
12171,1,Very slow  Order 3 things took 20 minutes
12206,1,Food was bad  we got sick  the oil was bad 
8652,1,Tried to order before hitting the airport they asked us to wait a few minutes We left after 20 without hearing another word
8653,1,They charged me for a medium drink for my nieces happy meal didnt ask for a medium drink The guy who handed me my food barely acknowledged we were there at the window He practically threw our food in our window while not even looking Almost dropped our drinks He was just shoving our food and drinks out his window blindly I asked him why we had a medium drink he said he didnt know because it was all automatic The cashier didnt give us our receipt so I asked him if I could get a copy of my receipt He stormed off and comes back about a minute later shoves the receipt in my face and tells me if I want a copy of my receipt I need to ask at the first window I just wanted to know about the medium drink otherwise I wouldnt have needed a copy of my receipt or if the cashier would have given me one I wouldnt have had to ask Worst McDonalds I have ever been to Never making that mistake again
8654,1,Service was quick but the person taking my order was completely unprofessional and not accommodating at all Horrible service When asked for my drink I stated half coke the lady cut me off and aggressively said 
12199,1,Pay for a large iced latte for it to be half full  Really eerks me 
12198,1,This McDonalds is disgusting Leaking sealing gross bathrooms and creepy staff Should be avoided
12192,1,Overpriced bad service and not clean Avoid this place
8658,1,After a few unsuccessful visits I have the impression youll be served if the staff happen to feel like it
8650,1,I love nothing more than McDonalds fries Its hard to imagine that anyone comes to McDonalds
25006,1,Avoid this place  Food is terrible here
26910,1,They forgot put gogur and SOS in happy mealand today did not put toy
26909,1,I had to wait for a coffee 30 minutes    not a good experience I
12151,1,Newest but the slowest  Fifteen minutes at the drive through to get our meal
26897,1,I got my order wrong twice first they gave me coffee instead of hot chocolate and then I said no ketchup on my burger and it had ketchup probably not going there again
8717,1,Zero customer service skills They dont even acknowledge yor presence You talk to them and besides taking your order and your money they dont even thank you for shopping there
8718,1,I dont like cold fries No one does When a sign says Customer Parking only does that exclude customers 10 minutes into the future I have waited longer than that in this locations drivethrough I had a combo stop to make Pick up some rum and bring home some dinner for me and the wife I parked at McDonalds and walked the 65 seconds or so to the liquor store A purchase and the return voyage took all of five minutes By the time I had returned there was a boot on my car The person responsible for this was in the parking lot and informed me that to be considered a McDonalds customer I would have had to make my fastfood purchase first and then been given  30 minutes in the parking lot Its a cold November evening Fast food sitting in a car would be cold by the time I had returned so I did things in what seemed like the logical order 90 later I was too disgusted to eat I went into the store to file a complaint but was bullied out by the towing staff This isnt a predatory company per se but theyre in bed with one
8719,1,Literally the worstMcDs in the world Going through drive thru she gave us our drinks and told us to pull forward by doorthen blocking the person behind us from getting out We took initiative and parked in th he drive thru spot Husband then went in to find out what was happeningdefeating the point of drive thru He said the staff were abysmally slow taking forever to put each item in the bag We were starving but only ate a little Ive never had McDonalds where grease runs down your arms and the fries were revoltingly greasy too Surprisingly none of us got food poisoning
8720,1,I was driving through the area with a friend and had to settle for this McDonalds after an hour and a half search for an open location that would serve me However I found out this location also did not have a working ice cream machine How can all the machines be down in a city at once This is some terrible service My drive thru order taker was rude and had no idea how to process a cash payment The driving lanes are also an apparent problem for the usual people coming here at night as two vehicles swerved into me and attempted to go in front of me in order to exit while I was at the ordering spot
8721,1,"Poor slow service an older man came to my table showed me words on his phone saying I had 30 minutes to finish my food and leave
I asked the cashier about the Man and he claimed he is security and that even though I had paid for my items I could only be there 30 minutes
I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told there was not one on duty that day I then asked for corporate office phone number and was told they dont have it
Very rude way to treat anyone at all"
8714,1,There was blood on the womens bathroom toilet I told the old cashier and she said o well I tried talking the manager and she completely ignored me I tried calling the number on my receipt 4 different times and everytime I got a busy signal My daughter and I were standing off to the side waiting for our drinks and thank god after seeing the kitchen area we did not order food I was completely and utterly disgusting Please do not go to this McDonalds I rated it 1 star only because I had to rate it to leave this to bad
8722,1,The food at this place is always cold and old Theres always someone that doesnt know what they
26896,1,Park lot was very small and congested I was stuck for 10 mins Employees are very arogant too
8725,1,"If I could I would give them 0 stars

Currently McDonalds is doing a buy one get one for a dollar 10 piece McNuggets quarter pounder with cheese and a Big Mac Instead of just charging me what a normal 10 piece and then add a 1 for a second one they made me pay 3 more for a 20"
26893,1,Worst drive thru took 26 minutes to get order WORST McDonalds in the world
8727,1,Could you update the lobby hours It seems to change every two weeks With the pandemic going on the least you can do is not waste anyones time
12150,1,Slowest McDonalds everget these employees some help
12149,1,Terrible service with drive thru check your bagbags before heading out to I87
8730,1,Dining room closes at 8pm
8723,1,The bathroom was disgusting Someone had left a mess in one of the stalls and bloody tissues by the sink biohazard I let someone know to come clean it but she just came in looked at it and left I was in a hurry with three children so we had to cycle through using one stall and there was a constant line forming behind us If my kids didnt have to go so badly we would have gone somewhere else I would never stop there again
12207,1,The new trainee and the person was very very rude and smartassed
12154,1,Im w that Ezekiel guy  my double cheeseburger mad cold  these dudes even forget my fries smh this place should be names the mcshitnalds
8711,1,So incredibly slow once the bars closed and the drunks got hungry Fries were old not hot Disorder with the 2 drive through lanes 3 cars in the outside lane back to back to back ordered 2 if those cars should have been behind my order while our car knowing what we were ordering given we had at least 20 minutes waiting in line just to get to the ordering boardmicrophone speaker sat at the menu for over 5 minutes waiting to order Overall our drivethrough wait time was forty YES 40 minutes Will NOT go there again Also the frequent harassment made by the half dozen homeless people begging for either money cigarettes food or to wash our Windows Clearly they should have picked up on our lack of patience at that point and left us the  Alone McDonalds staff or management should fix that problem for others as well
12165,1,I waited my order 28min 
25009,1,My son almost starved to death not nice
12162,1,Ordered at Kioskwaited and waited and waited for our food  So much for fast food
8696,1,I ordered 2 big macs They had no meat No patties Seriously
8697,1,This place is very dirty the employees are very rude They got mad cause we asked for ketchup Then we stayed in to eat and the employees are talking and putting down all the customers They have been putting the men and ladys in the same bathroom cause the mens is closed and then my daughter went to use the bathroom the lady up front said there is 2 men in there cause there is closed So she went in then the security guard need to use it and then the employees where talking about my daughter I went up there and told them that If they would take better Care and clean your place it would be up Plus you have food over every where they dont wash there hands they dont clean the tables then you ask for a wash cloth to clean they say we dont have any clean There is so many drug dealers here even the workers are sale I ng inside in the lobby in the parking lot I will never come here again Im also calling the cops on the drug deals I seen Even with a security guard on duty he just looks the other way DO NOT EVER COME HERE
8698,1,"Yo real talk this mcdonalds convinced me to never give mcdonalds another dollar for the rest of my life

Last place in all categories WOW"
26907,1,This place is dirty and has many flies Smh bad service as well
8712,1,I am highly enraged with their service They didnt specify on their signs in the parking lot that I couldnt leave the parking lot for more than five minutes They booted my truck and I had to pay him with my food in hand Ive tried talking to the store manager McDonalds main office and submitted a complaint All I get its the run around hung up on and berated Im not much for posting these kinds of things but Im out money I feel wasnt owed and feel highly taken advantage of
8701,1,Ordered a bacon egg and cheese biscuit meal and they give me no bacon They did send me 2 complimentary meals which was great I go back with the free coupon and they gave me a chicken sandwich when I ordered a signature burger Called their office to let them know and they did not care Now I call Corporate in Chicago how do you like me now
26903,1,Ice cream machine always broken Very low quality location
12160,1,Mess up orders all the time Im not impressed by the service
8705,1,I dont go to McDonalds often but Ive been here twice in the last year both times were terrible I went through the drive through both times One time during the lunch hour I didnt  get one of my burgers I got the rest of a meal but the quarter pounder never made it  in the bag I didnt know until I got home Tonight I waited 20 minutes no exaggeration to get 1 burger from the line I will never go here again I should have just driven home to eat It would have been faster
8706,1,this place sucks two of the employees were yelling at each other super immaturely the store was disgusting it took forever to order and even longer to get our food like I said the management sucked the employee he was arguing with just quit on the spot saying Im outta here and just left after being asked to do his job entertainment value is five stars quality is one star
12159,1,Waited twenty minutes at the drive through window  0 rating
25013,1,This McDonald
8709,1,"10112018  Zero stars if offered Employees and superiors lack customer satisfaction service
Because employees follow lead of supervisors can do attitudes are cant and wont
In regards of coffee and soft drinks we were told it is their policy  to not offer refills due to high levels of homeless
What an awful thing to say
The restrooms are locked To exit restrooms one must know we did not to press a button in order for the door to unlock
Definitely not the McDonalds for us We would not be surprised if higher management reads this review then ultimately bar us from their establishment even though we shall not return to this McDonalds location"
8702,1,The worst drive thru service Ive ever had anywhere From the time I started paying attention to how long I was waiting in line til the time I was given my food was 48 mins At least 10 mins before that I was waiting in line not paying attention to how long Id been there  So roughly an hour to get my food Then only to be treated rudely  by the cashier because somehow I was supposed to know they wanted cash only Not sure why since I had no choice but to run my debit card and it went through just fine and in a normal amount of time Ill never go there again Ill drive a few mins to another location
24970,1,People need to double check your order before you leavebad service
8638,1,Worst customer experience Ive ever had Period  Night manager read our order back to us extremely quick thinking she made a mistake I repeated it back to her She cut me off and told me that I was being rude and to get out of her line and that she wouldnt give us our food She continued to tell us how her night would be better once we left her line and how we had made her night so bad I told I just wanted to make sure she got the order right said she didnt care and told me to get out of line Craziest thing I
8637,1,We were visiting From out of town and came through the drive through for some breakfast The bacon egg and cheese biscuit was so hard it must have been under the warming light for hours It was impossible to eat My sausage mcmuffin was so dry  not at all what I am used to and I order these regularly After getting to our hotel room less than 10 minutes from there and finding out how terrible our breakfast was we called to let the manager know Not only did she insinuate that we were lying but was less than professional by far I have not complained to a fast food establishment for over 4 years So when I feel food is this substandard and take time out to call I would have expected some common courtesy not an ignorant attitude especially from management Needless to say when I come back this way I will not be eating at this location If I were you I wouldnt either 
8575,1,Trash Customer service is trash   Ill never want mcdonalds for real  Been 3 weeks since tomorrow
24918,1,Its really annoying that Google does not seem to let you report an Unknown Closed  I do not know if the location is permanently closed  All I know is that I visited on Sept 11 and there store and some of the surrounding parking was blocked off with fencing the store did not seem to be conducting business and there seemed to be some dumpsters and signs of demolition  No indication of nature or duration of the closure  Hence cannot say if its permanent  But they seem like they may be closed for a while  No notice beforehand from staff or signs
8577,1,I wanted to order but they didnt have a curbside option and they werent open for dining in A bunch of people tries going through the drive thru but because we didnt have cars they wouldnt even talk to us There were a lot of other customers too
12265,1,Very dirty facilities bathroom was nasty
24921,1,"Every single time I have gone through the drive thru at this location it has taken at least 20 minutes to complete the transaction They have a sauce theyre advertising on a poster at the drive through that says Honey sauce but when you get to the window no one knows what youre talking about
Anyhow the most recent experience was a great example of poor customer service and why we wont be returning to this location
Waiting at the drive thru for almost half an hour like usual the manager comes to the window where they give you your food and says that our my husband and Is nuggets arent done yet and requests us to park nearby to wait Thats fine as we do so without complaint The manager comes out 510 minutes later to give us our food We take it and get home to find that the bottom box in the bag was some nasty ass Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich and not 20piece nuggets Thats not what we paid for or ordered We go back to this McDonalds another day and ask for the manager his employees had to yell for him and almost convince him to come up to the window as I heard them yelling to him They want to talk to you countless times as if he asked out of frustration and anger After he was torn away from the slow work he wasnt helping with while in his office he pretended he didnt understand what I said and said he couldnt write anything or give me a coupon for anything since he didnt have some kind of coupon book I asked him if he could give us  what we bought next time since we had already paid He said yes and we left Yesterday was the last day we visited this location and we asked for the manager at the first pay window He acted like he had no idea who we were after that whole ordeal and gave us HALF off our 20 piece nuggets that we were buying He lied to our faces after he said he would take care of it You would think how much revenue McDonalds brings in the manager wouldnt be so stingy and would apologize and provide whats necessary to remediate the situation He acted so snide and unapologetic too Needless to say experiencing slow service disrespect and a poor account of responsibilities we wont be returning"
8580,1,Posting this review in hopes that someone sees it My number one complaint is the hours listed it says 24hrs but that is not true Im not sure when they actually close but Ive been there at midnight way later around 2am and 3am and theyre closed The funny thing is that theres usually someone inside to tell me that theyre closed I dont mind that they close early but they need to correct their hours if thats the case I frequently get off work rather late and Im usually pretty hungry I can go somewhere else but this location would be convenient for me for how close it is to my work Its also frustrating that they allow me to pay on the app and then not get my food Please adjust your hours online and on the app so people like me dont get their hopes up
12263,1,Again it is McDonalds Convenient but not good
12268,1,Takes forever to get your food
8582,1,Drive through Asked by manager to pull to the side and wait 5 minutes for apple pies to finish cooking No problem Received 80 of my order after those 5 minutes Both sandwiches handed to me cold Said he forgot 1 of my drinks and hed brb 2530 MINUTES LATER AND NO ONE IS ANYWHERE I circle through drive through again and ask to speak to the first guy  I just want my drink and the missing sauces Hes MIA The gentleman who help
12259,1,Stopped on the way to Canada Keep driving or get something else
26949,1,Poorly managed Management as no problem lying to the customer when an error is made
8586,1,Trash was overflowing Coke dispenser was out of syrup and worst of all my hamburger was raw Not a good experience
8588,1,"Hit or miss with this on On some occasions the service is good but mostly bad One Saturday morning myself and another car pulled up to the drive thru and waited for almost 2 minutes I pulled forward and went inside got my order and as I was leaving saw the other car just pulling up to the pick up window  Food is typically warm not hot
91822 sat at the drive in while they took 3 cars from the other lane after telling me they would be right with me   Left without ordering most likely wont "
24927,1,The worst possible McDonalds in the eastern side when ever I go to get breakfast im always either missing something or my order is never taken correctly and the ice cream machine is either being washed or Is broken at 9pm they either wash the machine early so they can leave early and the crew there is just terrible they never seem to have anything
24928,1,How do you run completely out of fish filet at 7 pm on a Thursday night that is not during Lent Inventory control must be nonexistent Sound like pretty piss poor management
8591,1,Would leave zero stars but I cant The food is nasty Re dropped fries and burgers that have been in the heater all day Only good thing is the lobby stays clean with
8583,1,I want the word to go out about James at this location He is the worst manager ever And to the Watson group that owns this location Im going to make sure that I spread the word not to visit this location because of James We waited over 10 minutes because you had only one drive thru open and things were going slow Well the clock just turned to 11 and we wanted breakfast They told us no Even though we were in line long before then and it is not our fault that everything was going slow I called James and I was upset I didnt swear but instead of him understanding how this would be frustrating he just kept giving excuse after excuse and then whined that he wasnt going to talk anymore and hung up on me Like I said I didnt swear but I let him know that it was rude how they treat people IF I CAN GIVE ZERO BECAUSE OF JAMES I WOULD Learn to understand your customers Until then  everyone stay away from here
8592,1,Drive through staff will short you 510 dollars worth of food almost every time Very slow service
24917,1,I just paid 1120 for a hard fish sandwich  cold fries At least they didnt scr
8570,1,Wish I could give them no stars cause this Mcdonald sucks everytime we go there they forget something in our order I will not be going back to this store plus the employees and mangers are very rude DONT GO THERE THEY WILL ONLY RIP YOU OFF
8553,1,Went to this location and went through and the first thing that happened is someone started moaning in the mic Then we ordered 2 large fries and 1 small fry and they tried to say we ordered 2 large drinks and a small fry it was ridiculous They were to busy making inappropriate sounds instead of doing their job If I could give less then one star I would Will NOT ever come here again
12281,1,Always dirty Mgmnt unpleasant 
8555,1,I wanted these guys to be better than the other locations nearby but they are all the same Open your lobby Its 8 pm 25 car lines waiting for AT LEAST 20 minutes is horrible All McDonal
8556,1,Do not order from here there was a hair in my soda
8557,1,Does not attend to the needs of a driver delivering food as they make you wait through the drivethru when the order is ready sitting on the counter while youre 10 Cars back Food is getting cold and they expect you to wait and then deliver this cold food to the customer when you finally get it What a lousy way of attending drivers new employees or new management is much needed for this joke of a restaurant
24910,1,go to a different one if you want a gooddecent experience went through the drive thru and then told on the second window that there isnt an order from me even though I paid then forced me to go inside to pick up my order that I ordered through the drive thru
8559,1,This location is a joke Theres a whole line all The way out in the street and we have all b
8572,1,Dont
12278,1,If you have 45 minutes To wait
8562,1,I went to walk in the lobby and the doors were locked 20 minutes before closing time Horrible customer service
24912,1,Got breakfast from this place today and found mold in my orange juice Feel so gross
8564,1,This restaurant has to learn how to treat delivery driver professionally and properly I went picking up an order and wait in the drive through for 35 minutes and it ended with them telling me they couldnt make the order because they turned off the screen The only reason they couldnt fulfill the order is because of their laziness because I have seen other McDona
8565,1,"Working a graveyard shift in the area I thought of grabbing a quick bite while on a quick break Pulling into the drivethru after vehicles in front have ordered female worker mumbled something about their system updating and asked to wait As I waited for a few moments she then rudely told me that it was still updating and couldnt take my order even though she took an order ahead of me I asked how long it would take but no answer was given I asked again she continued to say it was updating and that she couldnt take my order I finally started putting in a mobile order to make it easier on their end but she got back on again and rudely said ho while their system updated So I decided to leave to find another place to grab a quick bite only to hear her say that she did mention they were closed if I were listening to her

Another driver in the other stall was having the same issue with another male employee but was actually nice enough to let them know they were temporarily closed until further notice

Clear unprofessional attitude from this female employee Definitely needs to be taught better in respect and in having better customer service skills Guess when you get paid minimum wage Id be miserable too Bu"
8566,1,Don
24914,1,Post renovation this place sucks  The kiosks are worthless because you spend extra time filling in things about your order that are self serve anyway  And the order comes out wrong anyway  Also have 2 boys and instead of explaining there are no boy toys they just throw girl toys in instead  Also No sauce dispensers Now gotta open tons of packets Down hill for sure
8569,1,"Salt Lake City fast becoming a toilet
Elect leftist officials who live insulated from the population this Pelosiing is a blight
What a mess"
8561,1,So there is no way to get food from this McDonalds unless you are driving in a vehicle You have an entire lobby that could be fulfilling the orders of patrons without vehicles or staying in your nearby hotels
24766,1,Terrible service Waited at the drive up speaker for minutes before anyone asked for my order  Then proceeded to wait in the line for over 10 mins  If someone has food that is taking longer you should pull them up
24934,1,The drive through waiting lot and call in lot were full I had to wait in the middle of the road for 25 minutes to get my order Not good
12252,1,"Bad service

And why they closing at 12am on a friday "
8621,1,Horrible customer service They ignore their customers when clearly standing in line
8622,1,Ordered a Chocolate Shake and they gave me a mixture of chocolate and mint I drove back and asked them to fix it They made me wait 5 minute and gave me a mixture of mainly vanilla ice cream When I asked they told me thay the machine was not working right What a ripoff
8623,1,I cant remember the time I got good fries from them   Once in a while there are good employees there that make up for it but I have simply dropped this place from my list of places to go after the last few times Ive eaten there  I should say this is for all McDonalds
26934,1,Slowest McDonalds Ive ever been to 20 minutes trapped in the drive thru line
26933,1,no mcdonald
8626,1,High prices terrible food stale and customer service lacking Tried a few times to give them a chance but I
24965,1,"Supervisor  lady is very bad by her behaviour
She need more training to be a supervisor and learn how to talk with customers "
8620,1,They didnt have fries or ice cream Lets be honest though we already knew the second one
8628,1,Literally had two homeless people come to my car while ordering One of them tried to open my door on the passenger side The other one reached inside I am a grown man This spooked me Never again will I go to this location
8630,1,"So my boyfriend and I ordered a large fries and 2 large drinks We get to the window to pay l Had a coupon on the app for the large fries Then I was paying for the rest on venmo The girl at the register had no idea what she was doing She had the assistant manager come help her she had no idea what she was doing Then the manager came and we had now told them over 7 times to just take off the drinks The manager still had a hard time
How hard is it to take 2 drinks off an order
He then was trying to say we had to pay for the fries He eventually just let us have the fries for free We also had a second order with another large fries we had 2 phones with Free fries
They were all rude and didnt care about us at all

8609,1,The Hispanic females there were putting hair in peoples food
12231,1,Never go here McDonalds is so UNHEALTHY
8611,1,I walked there Would not let me order at the window I dont see a problem taking an order if you arent in a vehicle You get the money before you make the order And the lady was very rude to me she slammed the window on me and wouldnt even say for example our policy doesnt allow us to serve unless youre in a vehicle sorry or something of that sort s hi e was very poorly trained Remember you do serve the public a n d McDonalds isnt my favorite It was convinient It is unhealthy for you Probably live longer because I never got their food Ill never go there again
8612,1,Dining room was closed with no sign indicating it was Called to inquire why it was and female employee was incredibly rude When I asked why the dining room was closed she gave me a lot of attitude and said Uh because it is Because we dont have enough people As if that should have been obvious again there was no sign That woman needs to learn how to speak to people with respect
24955,1,Very bad service it took us more then 30 minutes to get our food cashier forget to put my son food so we have to wait for his food another 15 minutes I will never go back there
8615,1,Go to another nearby location and youll get better service All the employees are nice except for one The trans woman who works nights is ALWAYS SO RUDE shes the reason I dont go to this location anymore She goes out of her way to make it so you cant use coupons from the app as well For example the buy one get one free for quarter pounder big mac etc It can only be used when the sandwiches are rung in not in a meal she knows this and purposely puts 1 in a meal so that your coupon wont work and when you ask to have it removed from the meal she says no so you have to pay double Always an attitude Go to another location nearby
12239,1,Terrible They forgot 1 cheeseburger and the place was a hog pen
8731,1,Staff was unfriendly and food tasted old The fried onions on my signature hamburger tasted burnt We had just got out of a concert and they were busy but our fries tasted like they had been sitting around for 20  30 minutes It was gross
8352,1,Slow service
8348,1,Bad service
24673,1,Employees just talk amongst themselves not fulfilling orders or payments as we sit in the driveways like dummies waiting for a bag of cold food Thanks guysall 3 times different days and times
8112,1,The worst McDonalds service is slow and they ignore you
27397,1,The person who takes your order always seems to be mad the cashier is never polite and orders are almost always wrong Good thing other better places to eat are around here
27395,1,f I could give it 5 I would Ordered on their own mobile app so it seems like they chose not to read deliver the order actually ordered I collected  drove 10  minutes towards home before the kid figured out that his order had every single add on we had requested not be added I called and  zero apology  was told to drive back to the drive thru and collect OHKAY Lovely customer service already I get there and the manager asks me to return the wrong order I handed it back untouched and he made  huge scene of firing it in the trash emmmm your mistake No apology and ALL the attitude  Never  ever again Calling the franchise owner I would hate this guy to represent my business  I felt so sorry for his team mates peers who were embarrassed by him
12645,1,Always is a long waiting time I expend 37 minutes in the drive thru only for one happy meal dont visit this McDonalds unless you like to wait more then 30 minutes
12644,1,This place is super slow at the drive thru i was in that line for 50 min to get a simple happy meal for my kid this is not part of a fast food restaurant with that kind of time
27390,1,The manager who attended this Roanoke store was very rude the ice coffees had no caramel flavor the cookies 
27389,1,Employees change but as of 073021 at 411pm they will put no meat on your burger and no salt on your fries and if you ask for any condiments they will ignore your request They seem like nice enough people but their service is terrible no refund or remake was requested Never ask for your food to be remade Don
27388,1,The drive through service is horrible They gave me the wrong order and was told to wait I waited  for over 5 minutes for them The manager Maria Gutierrez might have her last name wrong FIRE HER After waiting for so long I had to drive through again only for her to lie and say she gave me my food Very rude individual Had lost all my appetite by the time I got the food
27387,1,Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service is an understatement The manager screams at everyone who is a customer To me his young pond has no experience in customer service I have never been to a place had experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location this is very true I have gone through drive threw and walked in To see bad people working there just do not care I did send message to McDonalds Company hopefully someone will see what
27384,1,I have been in line for 10 minutes and how you have it set up you have one line you veer to the right of the intercom or to the left but you only have one lane going to those intercoms I had several people behind me this lady comes around and cuts me off I got out of my car I said excuse me you almost hit me and could have caused a catastrophic accident  She said that the lady told her to cut in front of me and I said who and the manager of that McDonalds Sylvia said I did I told her you almost caused a catastrophic accident and she said its a twolane and I said no maam and other people in line roll their windows down and said its only a one lane and Sylvia argued with all of us that were  in line  waiting Youre going to have a catastrophic accident there if you dont get two lanes drawn up Number two Sylvia should not be arguing with the customers in line and she did not serve us I never use profanity I told her it was unprofessional and that it could have caused an accident and other people were telling her the sameIm very disappointed how McDonalds has lowered the bar in hiring people that will argue with their customers when the  are trying to prevent an accident I thought the motto is safety first
8123,1,If Asians order coffee youll get coffee without a shot
27381,1,They need to get more training First they tell me I only paid for the sandwiches not the meal Paid 1154 Two sandwiches doesnt add up  to that Came back told the girl Im missing drink She told me to go back around and reorder  I go back in line and get my drinks  I get home my whole order is wrong Just looking at through the food there were eggshels in the eggs Just terrible
27380,1,"McDonalds in Roanoke has been a disappointment to me lately It seemed like a good idea to use them as a fast stop for breakfast on my way to work this past week Unfortunately I was let down by the service I received 
The first day I ordered In the drive through and the lady taking my order seemed like should could not understand me so when I got to the first window and paid I asked for a receipt the ladys response was We dont have receipts When I got to the second window and received my food it was comandwich than what I had ordered 
I decided to try them again one last time the third morning in a row and the service in the drive through was rather rude just like the first time and I received the wrong size coffee AGAIN When I asked the man about it his response was I don"
8126,1,If there was zero stars thry would get it Awful service
8110,1,The Managment and employees need to be retrained This location is a complete joke
27398,1,They canceled my online order even though I ordered it 40 minutes before close and was just turning into their parking lot They still had 10 minutes to be open I understand Im skimming time but that
12648,1,More than 20 minutes for fast food and we kept getting skipped Management needs to improve Drive through workers are extremely rude

12664,1,The drivethrough is so slow Went at night and saw that the line was long but I figured itll be moving   Nope I was third to last and was in the same spot for like 15mins It was ridiculous I ended up backing up and leaving
8093,1,They were all over the place in the middle of the order they switch the worker and all they do is talk to other workers
8094,1,Waiting in line  and the manager fixing the register Bad customer service
12662,1,This is the most slowest McDonalds ever and how do you advertise eating around the world or whatever its called and have a ice cream that looks very good but cant try it cause the ice cream machine is forever broken just false advertising and poor time management

27379,1,Incorrect order and couldnt mix Powerade and sprite for some reason
24679,1,Cold food expensive to take advantage of the tourists and poor service
27377,1,Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service Never in my years of walking this planet have I ever experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location Charging me almost 30 for an order of pancakes and giving ME and attitude when it is THEIR mistake I very calmly stated that there was an obvious mistake on the receipt the cashier seemed new but for some reason the manager thought it was appropriate to put the blame on ME and not their lack of being a good manager and training their employees properly Disgusting behavior for a problem that required next to NO effort to fix but the manager sought it better worth their time and effort to be nasty
27361,1,I ordered a artisan chicken sandwich no tomatoes on 22219 through the drivethru and when I went to get my food they told me to pull up and wait I waited half a hour to get this sandwich and chicken nuggets The sandwich looks like it was thrown together way too much sauce It was all over the entire sandwich and on the inside of the box that made the bread soggy And to top it all off they gave me the head of lettuce and brown lettuce
12628,1,Wow only if this had a negative scale index because I wouldve given this particular McDonalds a negative 5 for the service and upkeep The food was cold and they had around 3 people passed out and drooling on the table 1 in the restroom some lady which my daughter could not use the restroom fire the entire visit Any ways this place needs help
12627,1,Always a disappointment Asked for fresh hot fries they were not fresh but somehow I had to pull over and wait for an ice coffee because they had to get the milkThey took so long I asked for money back
24682,1,Cant even take an order correctly Couldnt repeat the order back or even put it on the screen for us to review
27360,1,Yesterday 232023 I stopped at Roanoke McDonalds to get breakfast  I ordered the Big Breakfast with pancakes via kiosk  My order was number 797 upon serving me my food I ask for an extra syrup  The employee gave me the syrup but was very rude in telling me it cost 35 cents and next time include it in my order  Without giving me a chance to explain he walked off   To add to the bad service I discovered after leaving my pancakes were cold  I dont usually go to this McDonalds and usually dont get bad service at McDonalds but figured Id take the time to let others know how this McDonalds is treating its customers
27359,1,Cashier walked off and left the cash drawer open never gave me my change 10mins later all he said was oops haha
8158,1,Worst service ever from the store manager wow 
8151,1,Bad service 30 minutes waiting for a coffee
8159,1,if they were busy they have no quality
27357,1,"Incorrect orders most of the time missing ingredients in the food or missing chicken nuggets Poor quality of food

I am not really a picky eater and dont usually complain but I gave this location a handful of chances "
27356,1,This is the closets Mickey D near us and we usually always have a good time This time tonight we asked for extra sauce the white lady with black hair thick and wear a brown cardigan and bun Was VERY RUDE when asked if their was extra sauce in the bag and closeed the sliding door before we can ask for more She then reopened it after seeing we were missing additional sauce from our order she was very rude cutting me off and stated you need to ask for extra sauce when ordering since its now a charge for sauce But anyways we dont mind paying It
12624,1,Very bad service Employees were so rude not only to me but to others They had 5 workers 1 lady in the back cooking 1 young girl taking orders and 3 workers on one phone laughing When my daughter finally got her meal her food was literally just toss to her
12623,1,The worst McDonalds experience of my life they seemed confused and unprofessional they didnt know how long my order would take yet they where serving people after me they ordered and got their food then left meanwhile I waited 20minuits and had to leave without the food because every time I asked how long they ignored me and walked away without any answers would not recommend to anyone
27354,1,Terrible
24684,1,Waiting for someone to take my order 5 minutes later told to use the screen no thanks I dont work for mcdonalds Im the one with the money making the purchase I appreciate the option of the screen should there be a long line but for me to fiddle through all that garbage because no one can take the order no thanks there are far too many other options out there bye mcdonalds no loss
12621,1,I didnt get my drink and who ever took my order Youre welcome  Be aware always double check 
27358,1,Ive never come to this McDonalds before and I never will again The woman over the speaker was rude and handed me my bag and walked away I
27416,1,I went to McDonalds this morning for breakfast and got charged for an extra sandwich so I asked for a refund they refunded the cheaper sandwich which was not the wrong one and I pointed it out and they said I was wrong and they refunded the right one I was like okay whatever then they closed to door to fix my drink they apologize for my inconvenience smile and tell me to have a nice day handing over my drink I get to work and realize they literally only filled it halfway I was nothing but polite Petty does not look good on you McDonalds
8150,1,Absolute worst mcdonalds ive been to
24681,1,For a prime busy tourist filled location the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible  Many of the selfordering machines do not work when you use a normal line with a cashier its like the employees have never even been to a McDonalds before as they dont even know the menu items I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal so it wasnt pasta or some sandwich that only special locations have  When you order at a kiosk you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream  Then you wait 15 minutes to find out they dont have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one which she doesnt know how to do so you end up paying 4 for a cup of ice cream  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldnt believe it took that long  Dont bother going here its not worth it unless you want to feel like youre waiting at Disney at a subpar place
27376,1,It use to be good but they got new owners and it like they are cutting corners to save money Also the manager  just looks at you and not take your order
12639,1,It was the worst experience they didnt have anymore fries took a long time to take orders no sauce inside the bag
12638,1,Very slow and not friendly or customer service oriented
12637,1,Nasty bland no flavor meat undercooked no salt on fries  No shakes no ice cream Morning staff gave me muffin with no pattythis location needs help And or new staff Management is doing Poor job
27372,1,Staff wasnt friendly AT ALL and these are literally the worst coldest most unsalted most un
12636,1,McDonalds can go away have you had the big mc with the small as patty its all to oneside and the other side is all buns get home and those skinny fries are hard and cold mc donalds will never get my money ever again thats just me
12634,1,Wrong order waited on the drive through 20 minutes and another 30 wait g on my order like 15 other people were there also complaining about theyre order  never going there again
12629,1,worst speed  and service waiting more than half hour for a order don
27370,1,Manager on duty was very rude  My husband went today to pick up a missing item from order from the previous night that they forgot to give us  Instead of going above and beyond to correct their mistake and guarantee excellent customer service she proceed to interrogate my husband rudely  In todays world where there are so many options to eat you think that people would put their best foot forward to make sure their customers have a good experience I WILL NEVER spend my hard earned money at that location EVER AGAIN
8141,1,THEEE WORST MCDONALDS EVER
27369,1,My hash brown had sooooo much grease that it soaked through the bag GROSS Ill never get food from this location again
12632,1,I wouldnt recommend McDonalds food to anyone for what should be obvious reasons  Stopping there was not my idea Although charging only a BUCK for a large soft drink was avery very very SMART move  Im sure millions go in to purchase a popsoda  end up spending maybe on average say 500
27366,1,Nice people but this location lacks staff Childrens play area not clean Smells of dirty mop No soap in children bathroom bathroom smells of  bad odor
27365,1,Employees always seem bothered by having to work If you ask for extra of something on your burger theyll give you none of that and if you take something off theyll make sure you get extra of it This has happened multiple times now
27364,1,I always order the same 4 orders of the 20pc Nuggets For some odd reason its 12 more expensive at this location than all the other stores in the metroplex If you like to spend extra money for the same exact thing you can get from another location for cheaper than this is your spot For me its not The manager g
12631,1,I ordered an eminem mcflurry and so they charged me After they charged me I waited 10 mins just so someone can come and tell me that they didnt have mcflurry Like why tf would you charge me and make me wait
12633,1,"It was the worst I ordered my food from the machine I paid at 131pm at 200 i was just getting my food and i was quite upset everyone there was upset once i spoke to the manager she was no help they only had one person making the food and from where I was standing they were only giving the food to the drive through customer

So I received my food and the fries were cold and I ask for fresh food so they took the cold fries and I waited again when CDC the manage gave me a new bag I thought the order was correct I made it to my car and I went to eat some of my fries and it was a small fries and it had a toy in the bag so now I am so mad I just drove off and I called and let them know and the lady that answered she told lj e to bring my recipe and they would take care of it DONT GO TO THE MAC DONALD ON CENTERY AND FIG THE WORST SERVICE THE MADE MECRATE I DID NOT WANT TO GIVE THEM A STAR BUT IT WOULD NOT LET ME POST WITHOUT GIVENVTHEM ONE STAR"

27455,1,Very disappointed with this McDonalds I ordered a crispy buttermilk chicken sandwich meal and supersize my order when I drove uo to the window I paid my total and then I sat there waiting for about 5 minutes so I said to myself maybe theyre cooking a fresh chicken so I didnt mind the wait Well when I got home I took the first bite on the sandwich and let me tell you THAT CHICKEN HAD BEEN SEATING ON THE HEAT PAN FOR A VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY HARD LIKE A ROCK AND IT WAS NOT JUICY AT ALL IT WAS VERY DRY and then the fries that I got were overcooked every single one of them were burnt

8068,1,The first cheeseburger I ever ate from McDonalds that was horrible
8076,1,Bad service the manager with red hair i believe she is Hispanic is rude and disrespectful

8080,1,Cleanliness 15 Wait time 15 Customer service 35
27421,1,I usually defend fast food joints even McDonalds Not a very picky person However this visit to this location was very disappointing Defying all logic it took a very long time to get my food around noon on a Tuesday despite few cars The employees were emotionless and seemed to be rushing you through even though it still took a long time And then to top it off they got my order wrong
12666,1,Last time I got my kid a happy meal with 6 peice chicken nuggets and when I got home my kid said cookie they placed a cookie inside the box of chicken nuggets didnt go back and complain because I thought it was funny but this place needs help so slow

8077,1,bad service and they were not social and they were chitchatting instead of getting our order
27418,1,I went through the drivethru and ordered 3 cheese burgers I waited in line for like 10 minutes I get to the window and they told me to park because my food wasnt ready It wasnt even busy so I didnt understand why it took so long to make 3 cheeseburgers After waiting in my car for 10 more minutes I went inside to get a refund since I had to go back to work and I just wasted 20 minutes waiting for food As soon as I ask for a refund one of the employees walks up with my food and hands it to me I guess they forgot I was waiting on it I will never come back to this location
8067,1,Slow and rude people working at this place
27428,1,"Really frustrated with this location I usually go to the location off of Beach street and order the same thing every time I go there I know exactly how much my order should be I stop here because I happened to be closer to this location than to my normal one and order my usual 2 McDoubles I had just enough change in my wallet to pay for my order Or so I thought Instead of paying 150  2  25  325 I was charged 199 for ONE Mcdouble It may not seem like much but to someone who is on the go and on a budget I expect ome of the biggest fast food chains to at the very least be consistent with their prices I wonder how much Ive over paid at this location in the past
What made me most upset was that I didnt recieve a receipt for my order So in order to determine why I paid 215 after tax for ONE Mcdouble I went inside to the self ordering in the lobby and looked it up myself I dont appreciate not being told my total at the speaker not beinzing I didnt even receive one to begin with when I pulled forward from the pick up window It should be standard procedure to give a receipt for the sake of the overpaying customers"
8045,1,Only customer in store bad service and they got food wrong
12690,1,Place says it closes at 2am instead they block the window with cones 5min prior unacceptable open to close is just that Management here needs to be evaluated
27441,1,"Honestly I hate to do this but the moment I walked in it smelled like a porta potty and I was like let me just order I ordered 2 hot and spicys NO LETTUCE a large drink and a large fry The Coke was ok the fries like always not full but fresh and I got one sandwich with lettuce and one without I told the kid in the front this sandwich has lettuce one it which prompted him to tell the guy and girl at the grill to please fix it they shrugged their shoulders and pointed at the monitor and said well it only says one sandwich no lettuce

I mean come on guys The kid at the register made an honest mistake and instead of going back and forth with him just fix the dang sand which Dont sit there and argue So the guy in the back snatched the sand which and threw it At that point I asked for a refund little did they know I speak Spanish So when the assistant manager asked me what happened I explained to her and she let out this LOOOONNGG sigh so sorry I am an inconvenience to you but if you were to train your team members some customer service this wouldnt have been an issue Jesus the kid at the register was really nice and well mannered He gets a 5 star But my experience was just horrible"
12687,1,Order 2 breakfast combo I get to my job site and noticed hash brown was missing don

27437,1,Got the buttermilk chicken sandwich and not even sure if there was chicken Bit untonit and had a cold grey semi solid mass caked in flavorless breading Fries were soggy and unappealing Usually no matter what Mcds you go to you expect some consistancy with this one in Roanoke you can expect consistent bad food Stay clear of this place Staff definitely doesnt care and to say the food is subpar would be a compliment
12673,1,Never Ever Go to that Mc Donalds or any other Mc Donalds  They Are Horrible  Go to Farmer Boys 2 miles down the Road Youll Much Happier

24685,1,Very slow service took over 10 minutes to get two coffees and cakes despite there being hardly any customers Also restrooms were dirty
24686,1,Waited 20 min for a qtr pounder at 3am only to witness a worker scrape the onions off my burger with her bare hands I asked for a new burger she argued that I didnt see her do this  absolutely unacceptable
8283,1,They were racists
24717,1,Worst service Ive ever had waited over 45 minutes in the drive thru for a 10 peice nugget meal workers didnt seem to know what there job was Manager looked lost by what it appeared from the window
12520,1,Would give zero stars if I could Food is always cold Fries are never fresh They literally tell you they are closed at 12 or 1 am  If they dont want to serve you they dont and it
8286,1,Worse service ever 
27201,1,Uncoordinated rude and delayed
8288,1,The biscuit was very bad
12519,1,"Id give it a ZERO if I could From the time I pulled in until the time I was handed I drink through the first window I waited 22 minutes I finally got so frustrated because nothing that I honked my horn to get their attention When they realize that all I had was a drink she handed it to me through the first window and I drove around the people that were still waiting It was a horrible experience This is definitely not a place to go if youre looking for fast food I could have done better with a local diner
On top of that it was the worst tasting sweet tea I had ever tasted There was hardly any ice so it was warm it was mostly water and the flavor was like a mixture of regular tea and watered down sweet tea
I can honestly say this is the worst McDonalds I have ever driven through
if you enjoyed my review please LIKE below and as always have an amazing life"
27195,1,Their prices suck
24721,1,Staff were swearing on the tills wandering around in non uniform and using their phones The girl on the till in the ferrari jumper was flat out ignoring me as I tried to order as she was busy sending Whatapps to friends and the few people who seem to actually care and work hard are stressed as they work with slackers

12554,1,What a horrible experience I had today I came to order the spicy chicken nuggets  and also ordered a coffee with cream The lady asked if I wanted the hot sauce for the spicy chicken nuggets and I said yeah  but I never got the spicy sauce My coffee had no cream in it and it didnt have any of those small packages of cream 
12553,1,This place is literally the worst mcdonalds Ive had the unfortunate pleasure of eating from They forget to add items into your bag and when you go back to tell them they apologize but do nothing about it making your wait even longer If I owned this mcdonalds I would definitely clean house and get somewhat competent workers
27263,1,Awful

27235,1,Gross Numb City
12547,1,Worst Mcdonalds Ive ever been to They take forever and horrible customer service
8255,1,The worst service ever
12551,1,They didnt want to give me sauce for my nuggets and they didnt give me all my food and I live to far to go back I called and they wouldnt answer its a lot of high school children in there the person at the drive thru never made eye contact with me he was on his phone the whole time I was paying for my food and the guy that walked up stomach was hanging out from under his shirt I gave one star but they dont deserve any
24698,1,This place is really clean but the service was awlful my food was cold n they dont HV a dollar menu 
27271,1,Slow
27273,1,Rude
12577,1,Theyve completely missed my order a few times and Ive waited there for around an hour and a half once for my order I had gone the other day to get a burger and found a hair in it while I was eating it I think they dropped the burger on the ground or something before giving it to me
27291,1,To expensive
24700,1,Very over priced but did bump into my nan so we did have a good catch up about Corrie but there is a much better place near BURGER KING The straws are thicker and the drinks are cooler I would of gave macdonalds 3 stars but the old women in front of me how took 2 mins and 47 seconds to decide Yes I counted Drew the final straw
12573,1,Never any workers Tried to make a delivery order at 8pm and they called to say it was close but the person picking up the order said it was open and on the website also said it was open and couldnt cancel my order
12572,1,Horrible service All the employees are always clueless Came to pick up an order and the employee tells me order isnt ready so to park in the front Waited 15 mins for another employee to come out and tell me that my order was given out already Told him why did the other employee tell me they are still making my order and he is telling me it was given out already Had no explanation Made me waist 30 mins of my time
12571,1,Worst McDonalds experience Ive ever had Waited 45 for two double cheeseburgers Nothing was done besides a annoyed sorry Go anywhere else It would be faster to drive to the store go home and cook your own burger I will not return 
12570,1,05 stars if I could 25 min wait time for my drive thru order and they didnt even give me the right o
12558,1,Usually the lane in this location is crazy long but we thought we got lucky today because the lane was short We placed our order and drove to the window to pay We waited for about 3 minutes to be acknowledged A young lady with a yellow shirt possibly a manager was facing her back to the window and she talked to the cashier It took for me to honk in order for her to open the window to take my payment Not once did she say anything to us Not a greet nor an apology Just took my credit card and gave me my receipt I drove to the next window where another young girl was She gave me my food and I asked her if the lady in the yellow shirt was a manager and she said yes I then asked her for her name and she has the nerve to say  I actually dont know her name I just got back but Ill ask What How do you not know who the manager on duty is I left The service was extremely poor for no reason at all I ordered 2 happy meals and a nd chicken I think thats an easy order Horrible service The manager did not look happy As a matter of fact she seemed unhappy She chose to work retail and chose to be a manager
12569,1,One of my fries had a booger on it Never eating here or at another McDonald
12564,1,It took about 40 minutes to get to the window to order the food ok then it took another 10 or 15 to get the food The lady was very nice and took my order correctly the one who served the food is the one I have a problem  with Ordered 2 large combos of big mac Just to get one big mac and a fish fillet I mean called to see what you can do about it no answer If you guys are understaffed you can hire me to do the orders CORRECTLY Food for thought And merry Christmas to everyone
12563,1,They have the worst service I went there yesterday and i ordered a sausage McGriddle add cheese and bacon They gave me a biscuit and i told them the correct order They told me to park and we waited about 10 min and they gave us the sandwhich but it was a bacon and egg McGriddle  I told them the order again I waited another 10 minutes and like 3 people came out and asking what my order was and the manager said oh an egg McGriddle like nowhere did i say anything about eggs in my sandwhich and that took more time It took 4 people to get the order right Not to mention the wait And on other days i come here the drive thru wait time is 20 min to 1hr I used to work there and it is literally the worst location and it
8231,1,As usualpoor service
8232,1,I mean its McDonalds what can you expect
27274,1,Blah
8234,1,Lady was really rude from comtcer
24701,1,Used the drive thru Ordered three large fries Paid for three large fries Received only two large fries and no receipt was given to me so I couldnt go in and prove that I ordered three
12566,1,This McDonalds is ridiculously slow Poor customer service and they have turned fast food into extremely slow irritating food People have been patronizing this McDonalds for decades and the service has only gotten worse We deserve better treatment and service for our money Stop going there until the service is improved
8732,1,Horrible service the drive through associates just ask you what else they can get for you I literally told them thats all 4 times and could hear other employees laughing 
8733,1,Ordered their signature Double BBQ Burger tonight at the drive thru One patty wasnt even cooked The buns were burnt black instead of toasted Fries came out cold My wife ordered a 6 Chicken Nuggets with BBQ sauce Didnt get her sauce and nuggets were cold as well HORRIBLE SERVICE
12148,1,They didnt give us sweet and sour sauce and sprite tasted like mildew
25326,1,After visiting with a friend quite a distance from our home this past week we stopped off at this McDonalds location to get us a late night dinner I really wanted an Oreo McFlurry and was willing to even settle for some fresh baked or classic McDonald character bag of cookies but they said that their ice cream machine was down and they were completely out of any and all cookies sad face As we pulled away from the drivethru and continued on our way to our final destination we realized that they gave us the wrong order We spent about 20 but only received maybe 5 worth of food The lobby was closed the line was long and we were too tired to turn back I tried calling this location more than 3 times and even submitted a complainthelp request via the McDonalds app to try and get some sort of resolution to their mistake yet I still have notignoring all of my attempts
9201,1,Drive thru is horrible Mess up my order EVERY time
9202,1,The food was dry the fries were stale  I had better at other McDonalds
26697,1,This location should have stayed closed Why do they have a reopening sign when theyre only operating for drive thru What about the pedestrians The ones who cant drive At least I was able to walk in and  order food before they remodeled I live less than a mile from here and I cant walk over and physically order food And why is there a parking lot if we cant walk in And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru Youre better off going to the one on burbank Blvd Who puts a double lane on a drive thru and doesnt expect problems This isnt it McDonalds 20 minutes sitting in a drive thru
11762,1,Horrible service
9206,1,Sevice was very bad and employees were not in uniforms  no napkins and letting a person dig through the trash  and employees waiting on other employees before customers
11758,1,SLOW very slow
26694,1,"Just ordered two large drinks and two large fries Both drinks taste wonky as if the syrup in the machines are off And to top it all off they had me pull to the side to wait on 2 TWO large fries

Wont recommend this location to anyone looking for decent McDonalds fooddrinks Makes me glad I only ordered fries and drinks Id hate to see what else theyd wreck"
9209,1,They never get my order right wait is forever and no to people friendly

11757,1,Hate it
26690,1,"Food was hard and cheese danishes were hard
Workers forgot to give me water bottles
They were just talking and seemed like they weren"
25330,1,They have destroyed their animal themed building and now its boring Not worth going to anymore Why are McDonalds creating such boring buildings What a waste of money It doesnt make sense Its as if they are deliberately trying to lose money and encourage people to stay away
11755,1,Food was cold
26687,1,After waiting in drive through for 20 minutes  I ordered a filet o fish and large fries with ketchup  just to get a regular size fries not even filled to the top either  and a  filet of fish with no tarter sauce  and 14 of a peice of cheese  I always check my food right then and there because this location usually messes up drive though orders  and  when I showed them  the employee gave me a attitude and rolled their eyes at me  She even tried to say the fries fell out of the box into the bag  I showed her the bag being empty and even made the comment Even no ketchup  She then said I had to pull out of the drive through to wait for my order to be fixed it would be 5 to 10 minutes since my lunch is only 30 minutes I had no choice but to leave
25325,1,Worst McDonald ever The workers are really rude dont know how to work take millions of year to prepare the food OR take your order and when you try to ask for basic things like drinks they treat you bad or ignore you I waited for them to give me my coke for around 15 minutes and when they finally hand it to me it was a Dr pepper guess what I waited 10 minutes more for them to have the decency to
11767,1,Terrible service
11768,1,Sucks
9195,1,Never come back to this place again the french fries were hard and cold and so is a chicken nuggets
25315,1,Cold Fries missing food wrong food and no receipt for proof of purchase This location just opened not that long ago and lack of detail on orders given is already a huge problem If you want good reviews then pay attention to the people ordering your food I ran a McDonalds so I know what was not done and the leadership and crew members need work on actually doing what they are both taught and paid to do
9180,1,All the Macdonald  r having  problems  with getting  peoples on line orders ready
11778,1,Assholles
9182,1,Long wait employee didnt know what he was doing Manager seemed associated with employees and with customers
9183,1,Very lazy and not willing to help with any questions ans the manager doesnt have time to talk about an issue I was wanting to talk about
11777,1,Dry hamburger buns
26702,1,The employees just kept screaming the n word I wasnt even trying to eat here I was just walking by A
25332,1,"1st time today I Asked for  cappuccino without sugar they gave with sugar

9186,1,Had to say hello at the drive thru over and over to get anyone to take an order    And of course they had no ice cream
25317,1,We usually always go before the zoo because it was cutely decorated to the zoo theme and the kids enjoy the experience Service has always been meh but the atmosphere made up for it Now its just a boring modern McDonalds with bleh service The remodel was a mistake and if youre going to take away the only appealing part of the place at least make sure the service improves Probably wont come back during our zoo trips anymore 
25320,1,I received my take out spending  3000 My fries were mix old fries  My original chicken combo meat and bun was  burnt  I try to call no answer Couldnt return
9190,1,It was not a clean restraunt at all to many homeless people in there watching you eat and asking for food
26699,1,"I had quite possibly my worst McDonalds experience ever here After ordering a sausage egg mcmuffin with a biscuit instead of English muffin the order taker said

ok Ill punch it in so it comes out a good deal for you

Um Ok

When I got the order it ONLY had egg I politely informed the person at the drive through window but they refused to correct the order saying in a absolute terms that this is what I ordered and if I wanted what I ACTUALLY ordered Id have to get back in line and place a new order

What the hell

I wont be coming back here"
25322,1,Unreal this mcdonalds is garbage It was cool when it had zoo themed but came back home to visit to find my favorite mcdonalds right off the highway near the new tarnished Service is always lackluster at best and usually can be very messy inside since the remodel
25323,1,"The McDonalds buy the zoo pictures say it all   Food and drinks spilled all over the floor and tables trash overflowing  Dont even go in the bathrooms yikes  There wasnt a clean table in the whole place

Everyone was hiding in the back so nobody to take our order for almost 7 minutes   Had I walked around and noticed the mess we would have left

As Im writing this I noticed there is a wrapper glued to my shoe   The only nice person was the homeless lady sitting in the corner

Dont eat here unless you want to get Ebola"

26683,1,It amazing how many items you can get wrong in one order Fries were double salted yet undercooked Soda wasnt what I asked for Really just bad service from the drive thru on multiple occasions  This location does not properly represent the McDonalds brand
25335,1,We bought food and drinks with the kids After playing in the play place we tried to get refills on our sodas and were told they do not offer refills and we would have to buy another There were no signs or anything stating such and Ive never seen another McDonalds telling people this so Im pretty sure the worker just lied to us

26741,1,"They got my order wrong This happens often

To make things worse they are very inefficient Ordered a small fries they served 10 other people before I got mine Seriously fill up a small bag with fries while you await other order burgers I used to worl at McDonalds 10 years ago and know how it should be run Horrible

26747,1,I ordered a Mcdouble which was on their outside drive thru menu When it came up on the order screen it was shown as a Bacon Mcdouble I told them that I just wanted the regular Mcdouble no bacon So all they did was note NO Bacon and still charged me the full price for a Bacon Mcdouble When I got to the window I clarified again but was told they didnt have that in their system and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didnt have what I ordered I told him to go out and check his menu because it was on there He told me he didnt need to that it was not on the menu He was very rude and dismissive I realize it is just a few cents difference but why should anyone pay for something they didnt order especially if what you ordered is on the menu I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally and rudely I dont recommend visiting this McDonalds luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect
26730,1,"This Asian guy on the second window asks me to drive to their parking area because the order is not ready and said he will bring it to me I waited for 10 minutes in the car and he never brought it  I decided to walk in the restaurant they had the bag just laying there

9371,1,Im not usually one to post 1 stars but their service here is awful the drive through is so slow and we went to a mobile order and theres no reason why at a fast food place I am waiting for over 30 minutes AND their phones not on you cant even call them Im late to work once again because of them This isnt a one time thing its always like this every time I come here They have lost a customer

25392,1,"I could not eat the food from the zoo McDonalds so I gave the food to the cats outsideand the cats outside my house did not even take a wiff at itidk
Becarefull with the food up there in the Zoo McDonalds"

Steve and Piero are delusional  The one bathroom is unisex and you need a coin for that  Play area  Where"
11660,1,Possibly the worst McDonald
11658,1,Worst place Ive been to
25393,1,I used to love McDonalds fries but not no more You cant never really get anything fresh from McDonalds I used to tell them could they make my McChicken now when they did it taste so much better But everything is preheated or been waiting for you LOL
9382,1,Every two seconds the door flings open with another customer and you freeze to this cold weather On top of that the bathrooms require a token to be inserted and can  be obtained by anyone at the registers free of charge Meanwhile there are fully unlocked and working bathrooms on the second floor that everyone can use The worse part was that the entire staff was Mexican and did not speak one word of English to each other As a matter of fact they were laughing and having a great time in their own language while taking my order which is extremely rude to me and to other customers
9383,1,This place is newly renovated but it is not spacious The new touch screens for placing orders are the reason for this The new seating is cramped as well I placed my order with the cashier and she could barely understand plain Englishprobably why the touch screens are there Im not coming back to this McDonalds
26586,1,The kiosks suck People cant figure out how to use them so you have to wait If you can get someone at the register they act put out I managed to skip the kiosk and had to wait longer than the people that took forever figuring out the kiosks Been here 10 minutes and s
11664,1,Service poor rude employees
26593,1,I came here for a Uber eats order and their system was down and they wouldnt give me a Big Mac sauce for my customer for free because their system was down It
9367,1,Poorly trained staff horrible security at the front door by far the most ghetto McDonald
26594,1,From my experience today they have a bad job with the drivers who do Delivery they take time to prepare the orders and when they are ready they forget to take them to the drivers and with an APOLOGY they solve it they should be more responsible that is their work like ours is to make the Delivery on time
26608,1,"They forgot half of my order when I called them back  it was drive though the girl that worked there gave me huge attitude rolled her eyes on me and shut down the window  after new moments have me my bag with NOT CORRECT ORDER still The most shocking thing was the attitude Ruined our mood Do not recommend There are plenty McDonald restaurants in the area Definitely avoiding this one
Tip to owners  don"
11672,1,All this type of food is garbage
11671,1,Worst mcds manager
26605,1,My order is WRONG every time the most frustrating customer experience I live near this new location and have visited 6 times since the remodel and Ive concluded that this location is a 120 mess If all of my orders are wrong I can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases I ask for no cheese every time and guess what is in my order CHEESE Or my frys are half full or the hashbrowns are completely missing no syrup utensils are in the bag as requested On 3 occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order an employee brings out an incorrect order yes 3 times Today this New team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it what the hell Every other time I let the incorrect order slide but today I decided to speak with the store manager I let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders and she replies Sorry I then ask what is mcdonalds doing about this its every time the order is wrong She responds Im so sorry I ask again and same response  Meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it this new location is a joke its truly insane that a Mcdonalds is operating like this and its been a few months since their brand new building opened
11670,1,Dirty bad food badly organised
25384,1,Went to drive thru window at around 1130 ish and employee with copper tone hair like was very rude and disrespectful I was gonna ask her a question about another order that I wanted added to my order and she rudely said no  when I get to th window I asked her if that was her that I was talking to she said yes talking about that theres only two employees working mind u its customer service how hard can that be also wen I get my food and I get home I checked my food and it was spitt on my food  I understand that you guys ar understaffed but that is no way to give customer service I will be making sure that

25386,1,First I only added the 1 star because thats the only way to do a review  I  had 4 drinks so full they were spilling through the lids the woman at the window saw it spilling and still passed while they were dripping guessing she saw a look on my face this woman looked me in my face and said its just a little bit and closed the window  so I she came back to the window with half of my order my son opened his cheese burger and looks like a arm hair a eyebrow or puuuuub maybe I asked for napkins she gave me sooo many napkins Im like you shouldve fix this before you gave it to me i worst of the worst experience 
25388,1,Rudest night crew Ive ever experienced The boy they have acting as a manager is horrible and very unprofessional All they do is blast rap music and play with each other and be rude to the customers
25389,1,"Night employees are stealing from customers and probably the restaurant as well

9362,1,Ordered a buy one get one sausage egg and cheese biscuit  went home rook an hour or longer ONLY to discover there was NO cheese on either biscuit Im  a cheese lover so this really furiated me PLEASE DO BETTER

26596,1,Raw Chicken Nuggets served here If you want Salmonella this is the place to be They gave me a refund and kicked me out I wrote down my number but they clearly wanted to do nothing about it
26595,1,"Looks like chicken nuggets bite piece served change one is not complete cooked I got terrible chicken nuggets never ever
Atmosphere is bad needed more organized"
26601,1,The worse McDonald in LA Unprofessional stuff and very unknowable manager regards to health and food handling basics After realizing that the person who was working at the fries station didnt used gloves at all and he was sticking his finger into each box he needed to fill and touched each fries in a way that is improper and already contaminated I talk to the manager to ask why the person dont  wear gloves that it is requirement in the kitchen that produce prepa

9415,1,Worst McDonalds I have ever been too The water they provided was pink and when I asked if we could get new waters the lady told me all of the water comes out that way and there is nothing she could do about it In other words she was too lazy to get me new waters Cant figure out why McDon

11613,1,Joke of a mcdonalds
25430,1,Wow  Today I went through the drive thru  The cashier freaked out when I presented a discount coupon   The cashier told me the receipt printer was out of paper  When I pulled forward to the food pickup window  I informed them and requested my receipt  It turns out the cashier was lying just hiding the fact I was charge double on my credit card  I waited 7 additional minutes for my tiny order to be prepared  I brought to their attention about the overcharge  They said to call and they will take care of it over the phone  I have been calling the entire day  No answer
26564,1,Terrible
9424,1,Theres no need to order from the drive thru because youll receive whatever they put in your order
25381,1,Staff was very rude not the one at the counter but the manager was yelling at me to come get our food Me being pregnant and just visiting the zoo I was letting my husband get the food after he was finished getting the kids drinks as the lady continuously yelled at me to get my food Very unprofessional
9413,1,I used the McDs mobile app for the first time There was a deal available through the McDs app that was a great value  fit what I enjoy at McDs occaisionally Everything processed for the order once I succeeded in completing the order with small amount of difficulty Checked my account two days later as part of semiweekly review The McDs mobile ordering double charged me for the order They processed two charges for the one order When rhe corporate McDs was contacted they apologized stated the program has occasional quirks being worked out and told me I needed to drive out of my way to go back to the store to get my money back After explaining that they would have to reimburse my time and expenses to do their legwork in correcting their error of stealing my money AND explaining that they simply review their detail processing report of electronic charges for the two transactions I provided the actual transaction info for date time s etc they agreed to process the charge reversal because they WOULD NOT reimburse my timeexpenses to return to get my refund of money they stole out of my account After considerable time and insistence on my part the manager agreed and reviewed the transactions report verified the double billing and assured the charge will be reversed I got a follow up call from the area manager for McDs who turned out to be VERY unprofessional and rude in her attitude and handling if the matter She actually admitted she hung up on me when I was reprimanding her on her shortcomings for not listening to what I was saying and continually speaking loudly over me while I was speaking Interesting is this how McDs is improving the bottom line by stealing NO ONE at McDs even after explaining the process to correct an improper charge had a clue how to address or willingness to pursue They directly stated it was on me I had to come back to a store out of my way to get a refund of my money that they improperly seized from my account Unbelievable as that is for my 1st mobile orderpurchase experience wMcDs they were excited I used it and recommended I try the mobile order system again soon Yeah right Im gonna use a system with a 100 failure rate my experience and that they have no knowledge of how to process system failures that do occur to their admission  knowledge Horrible experience in all regards Clearly rolled out the program with known links and poor or no training in corrective measures when incurred
9410,1,CLOSED UPDATE YOUR HOURS GAS PRICES ARE WAY TOO HIGH FOR CUSTOMERS TO UBER TO YOU THINKING ITS OPEN RIDICULOUS

25400,1,Just avoid This was by far the worst experience Ive ever had with a McDonalds I feel like you have to be trying to be terrible to be as bad as this location There are other McDonalds close by dont bother with this place
26580,1,"What can I say its McDonalds  The food is never cold or smashed Its hit or miss on the type of employee youll get at the drive through They either dont want to be here and hate the fact that youre making them work or they smile and make you feel welcomed Its close to my office for a quick breakfast or lunch

Im editing my last post and changing my rating I waited in the DriveThru for 10 minutes with no one coming on the line The other line however three cars went through while I sat there I pulled forward to place my order at the window and I was told that I had to drive back around The level of unacceptable is insane  I try to be understanding of fast food workers because I know they deal with ugly people but this takes the cake  The day is Monday June 11th 2023 at 345pm The morning crew is a good bunch of workers however the afternoon crew has always been extremely slow"
11649,1,Food poisoning
25405,1,Why remove the animals This remodel looks cold  uninviting Horrible
26579,1,After decades of serving families McDonalds is on their way out I blame it on the district managers not doing their jobs McDonalds needs individuals who can read comprehend and speak English Today I went there for lunch I ordered 6 FiletoFish sandwich meal I ended up with 10 peice chicken nuggets HmmmmI  guess the order taker did not know the menu item or understand when I said FiletoFish sandwich I quickly caught the error and told the cashier She said So you dont want it Then the manager came along to find out what the problem was I  explained and received the sandwich I left and when I  got home I found out I  had a frosted breakfast pastry in a FiletoFish box Come on now McDs May we get better service and expect a lot more from you If not please close your doors to save the public from the irritation
11641,1,Just if you are in a hurry or want to save
9402,1,Staff behind the counter watched a homeless drug addict get right in my face and demand moneyand they did absolutely nothing  The guy even followed me from the waiting line to the condiment area and just kept staring  9 in the morning during the work week

9348,1,Never gets order right takes along time to get your food
26609,1,The white guy at the drive thru was good and friendly  The reception was right But when I got my order it was wrong  I went inside to get corrected The cashier and manager had some sort of rival  gang problem Instead of walking away from the problems They all started fighting It was horrible I wont ever go back there
11676,1,Pure chaos at this particular location
9283,1,The manager was disrespectful and Rude All the staff was very unprofessional Will not be returning
26648,1,Dont go   Usually  meals have been sitting around getting cold and stale before being served in drive through  I even asked server to please get me fresh fries since mine were cold and her response was

9289,1,Literally worst McDonalds ever service ever Never sat in a line so long
26647,1,"The new location is attractive
The staff member taking the orders was great but the person putting our order together gave us the wrong items
We paid for an upsize and got a lesserpriced size

Mcdonalds french fries are outstanding the rest of what they offer is oftentimes questionable"
26649,1,Never again will I order from here 2 times ordered mistakes were made Both were using the app so was apps fault but because they were short staff they could not find time to help and fix my order Waited 20 minutes to leave with nothing and not even sure my order was canceled
26646,1,Super Long line drive trough night time this place sucks what a mistake if you have 45 minutes to spare this is your place
26645,1,Dont go Theres another one up the street This is the worst McDonalds to ever exist Its actually not even a real McDonalds I think the franchise owner is doing their own thing here the food 
25359,1,Worst thing here at this location is ordering from the app an waiting for your order over 20 minutes now they need to get better service
9295,1,As usual  they messed up my order
11707,1,Shitty service shitty employees
9297,1,Customer service was horrible and the security guy was mean and horrible  Will not be going back
25360,1,"The App lets you order breakfast and pay ahead but when you show up and its 1003 their system wont let them complete your order

The location is relatively good the employees are always friend and fast

But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate officeapp devs and need to either decide to

1 prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the 1000 shut off or

2 allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order 3 minutes after its no longer breakfast time

I do not want to eat a burger as my first meal of the day at 1003 on the way to work"
26643,1,Literally the worst they literally never have working registers crazy wait times tonight they didnt have food They said they wouldnt have any food for another hr I work night shifts in the Area and they
25358,1,Apparently when ordering counter pickup after 9 or 10 they dont allow you to and gotta go through drivethrough
25361,1,Horrible costumer service the lady taking my order never even talked to me I even told her thank you after she had taken my order to be polite and she just turned around she filled the fries I didnt even care to complain but as u can tell from the picture I would have got more out of a small at most mcdonalds
26651,1,We have given this newly remodeled McDonalds a few chances The only difference is they now can jam more cars in their drive thru They will still make you pull up and wait for your order and forget that youre waiting Same problem as before Having this happen multiple times seems ridiculous and we dont even frequent this place Location is convenient but not worth it
25356,1,Boycotting until McDonalds corporate corrects the issue and brings all the animals back at this location If they only knew that was why peopl

9268,1,No longer open 24 hours Closes at 11 pm nightly
25347,1,I visit this place often but after witnessing the tall guy in a manager uniform one day doing a drug exchange in the parking lot would rather not bring my kids here to witness this type of thingthe owner should be ashamed of themselves for allowing drugs
25357,1,Normally every experience Ive had at this location has gone smoothly but unfortunately this Sunday when my family and I arrived the employees werent in the best mood Rushing thru my order and taking it in correctly missing items that were not even on my receipt had to get in line again The staff very unwilling to help over hearing a conversation with another customer a Hispanic father and young daughter trying to pick up a order and knowing very little English the employee being rude and acting like she couldnt understand Just plain old being disrespectful that my husband had t

25372,1,"So I got to this location frequently despite hearing the horror stories about this location because it is close to me Well tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it
First I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w Cheese Tea for the drink make the combo a large So the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink and he tells me that I ordered it wrong I said Well normally when I come here they default to sweet tea I said that because they usually do  He said Nah Thats not how we do it Then he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese

I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese sweet tea and make the combo a large I saw that it was not right on the screen but he repeated the order to me correctly  I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double The person at the window talked to the person who took my order and he came to the window and yelled I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED I told him that I said double several times when I ordered 5 times to be exact He person who took my order who looked to be a manager yelled at me NO IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE

I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea He finally told me that he would make it order but I did not trust him at this point so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back

This was an awful experience and I will not be back I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over 10 years"
9332,1,To much begging for money from homeless people come right up to the car
25374,1,Worst and slowest McDonalds Ive ever been
26624,1,I bit into the burger and the meat tasted funny and mushy so I cut it in half and it looked like this
26617,1,Even after they remodeled with 2 drivethru lanes they are not equipped for it Its super slow that you can order UberEATS and still get it faster Worse McDonalds ever and slowest fast food in ever
26614,1,How rude of the driver thus person that worked on 3152023 around 750pm we were wanting to get some fries and chicken nuggets and some drinks and hoping to enjoy a amazing meal from this McDonalds but we lost our appetites due to the drive thu person using a loud rude unprofessional tone the worker seemed rushed and we didnt even get our sodas due to the person being so rude Not ok
11682,1,Most toxic bathroom ever
9339,1,Closes during business hours for the lobby
25378,1,Never get my order correct always something missing 
25379,1,Line is ridiculous They need new and faster workers
9344,1,I walked in to meet a friend that was eating and ended up with a boot on my car Dont go here
26611,1,The studio city location has the worst service of any restaurant I know of Drive thru is marginally ok but inside is chaos There are people in the kitchen who occasionally come out to the counter to reluctantly help customers No one is charge It makes me wish we had a real McDonalds nearby I left a cold order of fries on the counter because no one called out the order number Never did get my hamburger Im giving them one star because the food is fine if and when you get it
26615,1,ORDERED A FILET O FISH KETCHUP ONLY
25364,1,I cant believe how rude this people is
11693,1,Slow and crack heads everywhere
9322,1,The place is disgusting Service was slow and the got my order wrong
9305,1,Its almost 3 am and it took 40 min for me to get to the pay window
11701,1,Bad service for everything
26637,1,"I ordered from McDonalds and I did not receive my Sausage Egg McMuffin
The previous times that I have ordered from this locationthey have messed up my order"
9308,1,My food was old and stale Barely ate my egg and cheese biscuit same with my hashbrown
26636,1,This place has ZERO customer service From no one being at the front counter to long waits to get food to getting your order wrong then getting cold food when they remake your order This is one McDonalds youll want to avoid going to
26635,1,It took 1 plus hours to get thru the drive thru  The drive thru is such that once in line you cannot get out No one apologised for the abnormal wait time When I got my food the fries where cold and the taste old I usually to not complain about a restaurant but 1 plus hours in a drive thru line is ludicrous Especially for a fast food establishment
9311,1,Can
26625,1,Cant believe this place is brand new and the parking lot is as horrible as it is This is the worst design Ive ever seen If there are people in the DriveThru everyone in the parking lot is trapped in the parking lot no menus no front of store employees and when you do show at the counter its like the employees are scared to leave the kitchen like they have high anxiety of actually facing someone or something You can stand there at the counter forever and no one will ever come
25367,1,Rude staff complaining about us sitting at a table All because they dont want to do their job Should of 
26632,1,Very disappointing after they rebuilt the whole building  It is supposed to be the most modern of Equipment and yet it was the slowest experience I have ever had at a McDonalds and only for two egg McMuffins  Then the English muffin was burnt on both sandwiches  The staff definitely did not want to be there  It is my closest McDonalds but I will definitely be driving the longer distance next time  Just avoid this spot no matter what
25368,1,Update Placed an order at the counter Attendant took my order upon me handing her my cash I was told she didnt have all my change and would that be OK I said no and left Great scam Manager round up why not round down
9316,1,Their sprit soda tastes just as faucet water
9318,1,They decide to take their time even when its a fast food and get timed
11695,1,Very slow service
11694,1,Impolite staff
26628,1,After sitting in the drive thru for an hour spending almost 50 asking for sauces and getting on the highway we discovered 3 missing large fries and no sauces We returned and received 3 cold fries with absolutely no salt on them Others were also complaining of incomplete orders as well
11698,1,Awful food
9088,1,add a maintenance person was very rude to me told me I was in his way and I Curtis Lee moved out of his way on purpose then you got a big guy coming up with no uniform or anything asking me if I got a problem its not a good place
26753,1,I asked for a peppermint mocha and all was well until I realized the hot cup they served it in was cold by the time it was too late and I was already home Drive thru service not the best when you have to yell out the order multiple times
25223,1,Terrible
8842,1,This cash orders only stuff is getting old get better systems No other fast food restaurant has to do this so theres no reason you should
8843,1,I couldnt place an order with a person at this location so we walked out and went somewhere else and ate The employees here needs to take a customer order instead of tell a person that they need to place an order at their self service machine We will not be coming back to this location
8844,1,the worst place to go that when the order was for my children and the answer was for me to leave because they were not going to attend to me
25076,1,Sucks
12072,1,I will never return to this location We went in there today and they did not wait on a truck driver he left without food and was very angry Truck drivers should be served they are the ones out there working for the country
25087,1,It is super terrible bad food they never change the oil poorly cooked food I do not recommend the potatoes black horn from burnt oil
8848,1,If you want to wait 45 minutes in the drive thru line this is the place for you Id have left but by the time I realized how long it would take I was boxed in by cars
8849,1,Every time I come to the store there is a problem Drivethrough constantly messes up orders the staff are extremely rude and they dont know how to even do their jobs Im surprised some of them can even get job heredont go to the store because your order will be messed up and
26859,1,Disrespectful Employees pissflavored nuggets somebody forgot to flush the toilet avta theyve tooka SHET my ah is nicer than this restaurant
8851,1,Pretty awful No human interaction kiosks not super intuitive paying cash waited 10 a while maybe not 10minutes at a register to pay cash Will go to Wendys instead Dirty tables and a homeless looking person helping customers on the self serve kiosks
8852,1,Consistently the worst McDonalds Ive ever been too I quit going here Even late at night they make you wait forever in the drive thru Youre better off going to the Wendy on the other side of the block
12065,1,The worst service I ever experienced at a McDonald restraunt in champlain ny very slow and have no clue whats going on they need someone to manage that place and speed up the service
8854,1,Probably the slowest employees in McDonalds history This definitely is NOT Fast Food  the lobby is always dirty and seems to be filled with drug addicts in part just due to the area Dont bring your kids here for a Happy Meal
12064,1,Ordered a chicken sandwich only to get home to find out I got a burger and since I was the only car in the drive through  not sure how that mistake could happen
25088,1,You cant ask a question because they answer badly a lady answered me in a bad way lousy service they should supervise so that those kinds of things dont happen
8841,1,"I awoke one morning from a dream Wiping the sweat from my brow I tried to recall the details Table service at MacDonalds I heard my self say aloud I picked up my phone to find my dream a reality MacDonalds had implemented technology allowing them to bring my order to me at the table I could order on the kiosk take a locator and lo and behold my order would appear before my very eyes It was as if God himself had given me a glimpse of creation

I sprung from my abode and ran on all fours to MacDonalds as quickly as possible as if reality itself would evaporate before I got there I arrived breath short and mouth whet   and began the final steps of my journey My finger met the kiosk screen like lovers separated by the ocean reuniting

I got my usual a cheeseburger with no bun or patty and sat patiently gripping my locator  like the staff of Moses The number seven sat abreast my locator  the day God rested I too would rest I exclaimed aloud when my journey meets its end as my food meets my table

But in the next instant I was met with a fate worse than Gobs a thousand fold  they called out my order from the counter and didnt bring it out to me

My faith was shattered that day Never again shall the thought of joy haunt my mind Never again shall true happiness be known"
12077,1,Very nice staff but took 20 mins to get egg McMuffin Not worth it if youre in a rush
12078,1,Poor service cold product nothing was good about my last visit
25075,1,Have attitudes
8817,1,Bad service No one knows the menu Says open 24hrsbut drive thru opens at 4am  Dine in not open either
8818,1,Ive disliked McDonalds for a long time now theyre always missing something of ours ice cream machine is always down their employees seem like they dont even know what to do I waited for this lady to take my money for 5 minutes and all she did was look at me and took the drive thru orders So I just pulled up to the other window to pay and it took another 45 minutes to friggin pay Never again going to ANY McDonalds ever
12107,1,Worse food ever way to salty Had to throw it away Definitely not the McDonalds of years ago
8820,1,This place is a god damn joke  My girlfriend and I went for egg mcmuffins at 800pm on a saturday night and it took over 20 minutes to get our order  The food quality was horrendous and no apology was given for the long wait  AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS  Seriously I dont expect gourmet food from Mcdonalds but this was truly disgusting  One english muffin was so hard my girlfriend nearly broke a tooth on it  My egg mcmuffin hadnt even been toasted  The staff was unfriendly and unapologetic  What a joke we are greatly disappointed in this location
12106,1,I ordered a coke and got a drpepper this is the 2nd time that they have done this
8822,1,Grossest McDonalds I have ever been to Dirty floors like deep dirt gum looking black marks But the worst part was the fly infestation Flies all over the food prep area and the tables Trying not to hurl while flies are landing on my head
8825,1,Super dirty McDonalds Stopped to use washroom and the employee in the washroom was getting changed hands all over stuff in there and just walked out without washing his hands The same employee then walked out from behind the counter later and kicked some trash on the floor didnt even react to it or bother to clean it up SodaPop syrup dried all over the drink station with lids and straws in absolute disarray Management here must be awful to allow this kind of behavior and terrible level of cleanliness
8857,1,I usually get the big Mac and or cheese burger for my meal Instead I was hungry today and got the quarter pounder with cheese and was grossly disappointed No pickles or onions just cheese a hamburger patti and ozing grease Worse burger Ive ever had and I will never have another
12102,1,Consistently terrible and slow servicequality They also dont stay open during the hours they list closing early
12095,1,Bathroom was disgusting Major need of updating broken tiles not clean at all when i went in on may 15th 2016
8831,1,Terrible drive thru Super long wait even at an odd time of day Cold food less than great service and they handed me my drink half full flat and with the ice already melted
12090,1,Service was slow no napkins anywhere I watched an employee put his hands in his pants and then continued to work without washing his hands Then touches an ice cream cone ew
8833,1,Honestly have never had a worse experience at a McDonalds The order confirmation screen is broken and the person taking orders apparently has not received training on reading back the order for accuracy Three out of three times I have been to this location they have messed up something major on the order The most recent time I got some serious attitude from the person taking orders Spend a few extra minutes to another location or go to Burger King
8835,1,Turned away because I dont drive These are unprecedented times the lobby is closed and I am not allowed to order inside also told I am not allowed to order through the 
25074,1,Terrible and unorganized
8837,1,Too anal about parking Parked there because had to stops McDonalds then the liquor store Went to the liquor store first because didnt want our food to get cold waiting at the liquor store that was packed Came back to drop off the bottle to go I to McDonalds and they booted my vehicle Wasnt even parked there 5 minutes ExplaiNed to the guy that I was going I to McDonalds as well  he didnt care He said I should have gone in McDonalds first Umm then I still would have gotten the boot foe leaving my vehicle there  No win situation Well he took my last 25 that was my grandkids dinner money to unboot it Cant return the liquor and couldnt buy them their dinner either Thanks McDonalds parking enforcement Real winners
8828,1,I just watched a vagrant peeing in a cup while eating my breakfast He then dumped his piss cup out on the sidewalk For Gods sake ppl stop handing out money to hobos it just makes the issue worse He wasnt even handicapped yet he sat in a wheelchair I watched him for an hour When he didnt get any money from passing customers he stood up and walked away with his Help Please sign This McDonalds is filled woth hobos often and I wont be back
8858,1,Showed up went inside was waiting for friend to get off phone with his father in hospital to see what he wanted to eat Security decides Im just a nuisance Time taken to occur 4 minutes 35 seconds
8859,1,"Is this Mcdonalds or some strange car booting  entity governed by sketchy  people   Very strange booting  practices  They film you leaving your car yet say nothing The sign is too high and barely visible They basically  boot your car for not going straight to  McDonalds 

I left to get a wine then grab something from Mcdonalds as well since i was hungry However on my way to  liquor store an old man told me to go back grab my car since it will be booted It already had been booteed ONLY 34 mins later when i ran back

They wouldnt take it off so i kept complaining Hey said  i should eaither pay 75  now or 250 after its towed 

This is a disgusting practice in a first world country"
8861,1,A racist appalling and unacceptable behavior by the security and employees occurred today at this McDonalds My friend suffered a racist attack by some other white customer who asked the security to have them take my friend who is Hispanic out of the restaurant simply because of the white customers request This is shocking and disturbing behavior and needs to be remedied and addressed immediately This restaurant will suffer lawsuits very soon
8886,1,I would give a zero if I could I rarely if ever take time to give a bad review but I ordered 60 pieces of nuggets and then they gave me 20 Then when I tried to call the phone wouldnt work Finally when I walked back they acted like it was my fault because I forgot the other bag that they didnt bring out when the called my order Terrible place
12041,1,There is always long wait at drive through sometimes even for 1520 minutes
12039,1,Just went there after it opened after over a month of building a new restaurant This place has been known for getting orders wrong all the time first time going there in a while got my order wrong Puts a bad taste in my mouth literally
8890,1,Always seems to be a problem when we go at night after hours like between 12a 4a Be it a system failure  stock depletion  etc  Also the employees are hardly ever happy or cordial in doing their job
8892,1,Dont seem to know how to read special orders especially when it comes to food allergies
8893,1,Manager is rude Repeats order 3 times different everytime Gets it wrong then blames us and tells us to go back in line if we want to order more  Also shake machine never works Likely they dont have one
8894,1,Horrible service horrible food why is it that no matter where you go these days it gets worse McDonalds is food thats all you have to do and they cant even do that right frappe machine is constantly down they say because of cleaning I doubt they even clean the thing they just dont want to do it Wake up your fast food you dont want to do the job go somewhere else and be lazy
8885,1,Put Straws In The Bag Maybe retrain your staff It
26839,1,It appears this location burned down or was leveled for reconstruction  There is no building only steel support beams and a fence around the lot
12032,1,"They seem to be indefinitely out of bacon Last week no bacon in my double cheese burger although I asked for it and today they replaced it with ham in my BACON McMuffin

Edit after weeks of ordering there they always do mistakes on every other order"
8899,1,Its sad when someone hates their job so bad that they can
8900,1,Absolutely horrific For a McDonalds which I normally dont mind when the craving hits this location consistently has extremely long waits and bad food I will always drive to a location farther away even for a simple double cheeseburger or spicy chicken
8901,1,Order french fries no salt got the limpest french fries in the world cold and then I got the spicy McChicken the chicken patties had been sitting there for at least an hour to an hour and a half there so dried out and not even hot temperature wise how does McDonalds keep going when they dont care about their food or their customers anymore
12031,1,Food was cold Asked for no pickles got pickles Fries were stale and we waited 10 minutes for the food Why was it cold if we had to wait Only reason we stopped was there was no where else to go
26835,1,This was one of the worse experiences Ive ever had  We sat in the parking lot for 20 minutes waiting for our order  They forgot about our order  Then when I got it it was missing stuff
8904,1,If any McDonalds could get an order right I would be shocked my blood pressure rises Everytime we get a kids meal for my kids any McDonalds you walk in to is a shot show once I ordered a spicy chicken and I received a bun with lettuce and mayo No chicken the other I got my son a 6 piece nugget kids meal they rang up a 4 piece nugget then charged me 150 for two extra nuggets then only put 3 nuggets in the meal i hate everything about McDonalds the service the lack of knowledge or common sense to freaking puti a piece of chicken on a bun or not being able to count its really sad
26836,1,This place has changed a lotThey forget about your order or forgets certain things in your orderNow there are more homelesssNow there are teenagers working there and messing up your orderMy grandma asked for a ice cream cone but they gave her a cup insteadI recommend going to a different McDonalds for right now until they fix the problems
8816,1,ice cream machine is always broken literally always w
8884,1,This mcdonalds is a heinous cancer on society They will boot your car if you are there longer than thirty minutes or they assume that you did not eat there there was a guy hanging out accros the street filming people parking He had us on camera going into the mcdonalds we had a receipt and he still put a boot on our car After arguing with him and going over footage and receipts he finally admitted his mistake What an atrocious piece of garbage company This experience is the last straw for a sub par fast food restaurant Im done with mcdonalds theres plenty of other sub par restaurant that dont boot paying customers cars
12047,1,"Ordered 40 dollars worth of food drove 15 miles home to find my grandson didnt get his chicken MC nuggetsthen drove back 15 miles back for the nuggets gas  time because of their mistake
And I get an apple pie wip pe do thanks alot Champlain MC Donands"
8862,1,Loud and crowded  Table was uneven and whobbley  Horrible place for a date weekend evening  Server kept coming and asking if we were ready to order every couple minutes  Felt rushed
8863,1,If you wanna wait 15 minutes in the drive thru line to be told cash only literally happens every time Have never had a quick positive experience here and I live down the street Go to another location and dont waste your time Such A Joke
8864,1,I went inside bought my food was harrased to use the bathroom  went outside started eating my breakfast and was told i had to keave because i had been there 30 min I was in the middle of eating an egg mcmuffin and got kicked off the property Wont be back Who does that to their patrons Naxis
8865,1,It was terrible first off they overcharged Me by like 12 do not say sorry or apologize One Time and then I get home I dont have my fries and my meal and my burger has onions on it Im allergic to onions so I cant even eat it I call and complain ask for new burger do you think they can make it right nope I dont recommend it to anybody not even my worst enemy
12061,1,Meal was late fries cold and I had to enter from the drive through to get my soft drink that was not brought out to the car
12060,1,12 hour waiting for two egg McMuffins Bathroom gross
8868,1,The 15 minute wait time in the drive thru is no joke Management does not care At least the Homeless dude made some  panhandling from all of the waiting cars Avoid the gridlock
25101,1,Very badly
8870,1,So bad customers service   we were here for a business trip  we dont want to order on the machine so we ask the guy to help us and he refuse to do so So bad that Ill no come back again I it was kind a cold I hope not cold heart 
8873,1,This Mcdonalds needs new management Every time I have been there the manager not the employees screw something up on my order The managers are very rude and dont have a problem using swear words to try and get their point accross Just from what I have seen that store would be better off with no managers than the ones they have now they might even show a profit I have stopped going to this Mcdondalds and will never go back even though they are only blocks for my work
26853,1,Same as any other Mc Donalds in the world a lot of the homeless comunity visits there so its good to always give them a hand
8875,1,Bad communication when ordering through the drivethru When I recommend this place if customer service is important to you
26852,1,Waited about half an hour in the drive thru  They informed us they could only accept cash  No sign telling us that before pulling in  Dont go here late night
12051,1,Possibly the worst and slowest fast food experience I have ever had The only thing that was good about this restaurant is that it was clean
8879,1,Average food except they dont fill the fry containers all the way The large is a medium at best The bathrooms are horrible  Someone had taken a dump in the corner and there it laid Yuk
8880,1,Stupid slow location wasting lots of time ever time you go there Needs a good manager
12056,1,Been here multiple times and had to wait over an hour and a half the first time half hour this time Called and emailed the first time with no answer and this time was told I dont pick my team or do schedule
8815,1,"This is the worst McDonalds in the state and the worst one I ever visited in my life avoid it I revisit this location occasionally for the past 5 years due to its convenient location thinking it had to improve I am disappointed every time

The staff here is extremely rude The food is poor quality Drive though time is long Dont know how this store passes McDonalds standards"
8814,1,Waited in line fire 20 minutes and then they told us it was closed Terrible customer service with the worst night Iv
8813,1,This place is not 24hrs at all They need to fix it Been there a few times late or early and they signs saying use the ap but no one is in building and ap does not place order
8755,1,We were going to the Childrens museum  my granddaughter wanted McDonald Apparently at this location they will only take your order in the drivethru We had to call over the counter for help We were told that we had to order from the kiosk I explained to them that I had cash They told me that I still needed to order from the kiosk  then pay cash at the counterwhatthen why wont they just take my order Then we had to call over the counter a 2nd time because we were struggling with the kiosk The lady that came out said I had to order my meal a la cartewhat Needless to say we walked out  will  NEVER return If its such an inconvenience to take peoples orders inside maybe they should close the lobby at this location  only have the drivethru From the way people were treated while I was there  reading other reviews apparently the customers inside real do NOT matter Im surprised that McDonalds would allow a location franchise to treat customers this way
8756,1,I went to order Sweet and Spicy glazed tenders I said it numerous times and the drive through kept asking what sauce I wanted Should be obvious Sweet and Spicy  glaze  I left there and went to McDonalds on 1700 S  Redwood Road  Much better service and food is what I ordered
26886,1,  trash
8758,1,This Store is the highest priced store probably the most unfriendly and unprofessional in Utah The heavy set Hispanic lady at the counter had just taken an order from the young man a head of me and would not take my order She was going to make me do my order on the kiosk When I told here no that I would go somewhere else before I would do that she told me goodbye Yes I am done with mcdonalds You are not getting another dime of my hard earned money ever if you continue these business tactics I will be happy to hear you are in bankruptcy Enjoy the time you have left Just a side note I have been going to this mcdonalds for over 3 years at least one day per week Never again Good thing Wendys right around the corner was more than happy to take my order and my money Funny part is Wendys double burger had more meat and tasted better and the price was almost a dollar cheaper
8759,1,"I bought two coffees for my twin and I planned to buy some food tried to use the bathroom first it wasnt available for 45 minutes so I left without purchasing anything else
Thats a zero rating but I need 1 to post"
8760,1,Went inside to get service faster oh was I wrong Waiting for more than an hour to be served paid at the touchscreen got cups to serve drinks and soda was terrible other people left and requested a refund people got fired this same night  Elderly people were still waiting to get some food and told me about their bad experience they seem to be patient but dang this has to be the worst experience in a McDonalds ever We are Never coming back
8761,1,First My Hamburger Was Ugly It Had The Ketchup All Over The Place Next My Fries Were Super Salty And Some Way To Crispy And Lastly My Shake Tasted Horrible You Could Taste All The Syrup And There Was No Cherry The Only Good Thing About My Trip Was Their Playground
8754,1,This McDs SUCKS Their food is disgusting and their service sucks They forgot my kids entire happy meal and when they brought it out there was no toy and no chicken nuggets We ordered sundaes to go and they delivered it to a random table and took some other guys marker And to top it all off they were RUDE like it was my fault they suck at their job This is the absolute WORST experience Ive ever had at a restaurant ever
8762,1,What a joke I went to this McDonalds I work at Gateway got some chicken nuggets asked for an extra  sweetandsour sauce on top of the two that they usually give you was very nice to the lady didnt say youre welcome when I said thank you and did not put my sauce in the bag no I don
8765,1,Sat waiting for several minutes before asking for help several times i said typical bs and backed up to enter other lane when i heard a man laughing from the mic and saying hello
12132,1,Cant order the two for 5 because they arent offering it although its the first thing you see pulling into the drive threw
8767,1,Horrible Bad customer service awful food cold hot and spicys were burnt fries were half empty cold and just tasted like oil just a bad experience overall Location on 700 east and 250 south is definitely worth the extra few minute
12130,1,Poor service order messed up greedy floor extra long wait no counter people
8769,1,I feel that it is OK to charge to use the restrooms Yet they are so gross its not worth it Employees sneezing on Apple pies whipping hands on seat of pants The new management is not any better They where dumb to buy this one If you have enough room to install two toilets then install two toilets dont be ghetto and only have only one
26884,1,They don
8771,1,"Do not park in their lot even if you are eating there

The parking enforcement put a boot on my car after I ate here and refused to take it off unless I paid 75 I told him I just ate here and he told me the ATM was inside seriously

Not to mention that the lobby was littered with food waste staff was rude they didnt have ice cream or shakes and bathrooms were dirty

0 stars if I could"
26885,1,Did the mobile order thing I asked for extra onions and got none at all thats how difficult it is for these people to understand English and even said it on the receipt extra onions
8772,1,We were waiting in the drive thru on a Sunday morning We were asked for our order only AFTER WE had said something about asking if our order was going to be taken and after having 5 other cars in the drive thru next to us  had gone We started ordering and then the employee on the intercom said mid order hold on Im helping a customer Um isnt that what youre supposed to be doing with us I said screw it and drove off Youre in the customer service industry I suggest learning some
8753,1,Horrible experience Waited for over 30mins in the drive thru to have them forget part of our order Not to mention they couldnt figure out 
8751,1,I understand youre under construction but your employees are ridiculous The employee that shuttles the money was one his cell phone the entire time I gave him a 10 and told him I had the correct change but he just walked off still on his phone Also if I order and pay for a medium fry I dont want a small amount in a medium container just thrown in the bag
8735,1,The employees at this location threaten my sister inlaw because she asked for a happy meal she ordered but didnt get The manager needs to hire people who dont threaten their customers
8736,1,Seriously this is the absolute worst service Ive ever had The manager is lazy and we sat in the drive thru for 15 damn minutes We pulled up to the first window and he opens the window and sits there talking and completely ignored us Then we pay and pull up to the 2nd window and literally 3 employees are sitting there talking Were at 15 minutes and counting and still sitting at the 2nd window All for 2 hash browns and a sandwhich
8737,1,The drive through is open during construction but the it took almost 15 minutes of waiting at the window then the manager handed me the food and drink while loudly arguing with a coworker about how they dont like working together No apology for the long wait Wont go back to that location again
8738,1,Very rude Will not come again I
12144,1,Worst food ever made Like seriously are they trying to kill off people slowly
8740,1,We came to eat McDonalds to have a lovely meal as friends in the evening of June 3rd We were informed that we were not allowed to order chicken nuggets because it was breakfast time When we got back to our place we were extremely disappointed to find our large fries container was half full cold and had no salt whatsoever My sausage egg biscuit was missing the
25020,1,I dont like it at all
12134,1,Very rude manager  waited 40 minutes for our meal to have it handed by the manager practically shoving it at me  and saying here 
8742,1,At first glance the place looks good but the first quarter pounder was cold and when I watched them fix the second I found the the commercial about being cooked fresh is bs They pulled the meat from a drawer and it was barely warmer than the first Then the flies inside were all over everything Yuk the last time I will come here Right before I left a guy came in and tried to get some water and a rude sweaty security guard was stopping him Wow this place is not where I would take family
25025,1,Repeatedly can
8745,1,Fifteen minute wait in the drive through They dont pull cars aside with larger orders to keep the line moving Predatory booting person roaming the lot Youll probably be more comfortable with police supervising the exchange if you happen to get booted
26889,1,Dont come to this mc Donalds They always takes forever to prepare your food and constantly passes people in front of you
8747,1,So 420 in the morning obviously means something else to this McDonalds  No coffee made up The jerk at the window couldnt have been more rude and put off that we were there  Today we were up early to start our long drive home after what was a very nice weekend in Salt Lake City  If this is the impression McDonalds wants to leave the I am happy to never frequent any of their establishments  15 minutes from the time we paid til the we got our food in the drive through and two cars behind us got theirs ahead of us  All we ordered were two cokes and two sausage biscuits
8748,1,Spent over 20 minutes in line to be told that only serve breakfast at 2am even though their menu said lunch also  Then told they were out of almost everything  Dont waste your time going here at night  Ive gone two separate times and had seriously awful experiences  Dont go here theres a Dennys near by and several gas stations with better service and better food
12136,1,Only to use the restroom I dont eat garbage
12135,1,Food was called and tasted terrible
25023,1,Got my order wrong Bye bye
8905,1,Food is more expensive here than all the other McDonalds especially dollar menu items like McDouble etc for example a 4 piece nugget is 220 when it
12129,1,Cold fries and burgers wrong order sandwiches put together very sloppy really needs to step up with their customer service 
8776,1,This particular store you never know when their lobby is open Quick service but they never abide by their posted hours
8797,1,Awful place ordered and ate my chicken tenders fries and drink Threw away the waste and sat back down to make a phone call McDonalds security kicked me out Said I couldnt stay more than 30 min I was there 25 minutes and there was 5 other people in the restaurant Horrible
8798,1,This McDonalds forces customers to use the new machines I couldnt order a large orange juice on my breakfast meal so I asked an employee for help She didnt know how to order that from the machine either She told me just order the small and that she would get me a large While Im waiting for my order another employee I think it was the manager told me I owed 50 cents for the large orange juice She seemed annoyed with me and maybe the young girl too because we didnt know how to order the large OJ  I paid the 50 cents but was unhappy with how unfriendly and the whole experience was I wont be back to this particular McDonalds
12116,1,It was the worst service Ive ever seen it took 45 minutes to get our food chicken nuggets Egg McMuffin and two drinks
8800,1,We go here after almost every late night event we attend in Salt Lake City Concerts Jazz games Utes games Will probably find another place The Fries have been way below the McDonalds standard for the last few times and this last time they changed their ice cream completely Now the vanilla cones and the hot fudge sundaes are made with that cheap ice cream that is a cross between a terrible sorbet and cheap refrozen ice milk Truly disgusting At least the Cokes were 100but that wont bring us back
12115,1,Their food is excellent by day but mess up orders at night it seems like the best time to eat is in the morning
26879,1,Cold fries Incredibly long wait for 3am were talking 20 min for each customer And incredibly horrendous customer service AVOID THIS PLACE
8803,1,No one to take your order just really confusing monitor that took twice as long  Took forever to get food and c it was still messed up  Only high point was watching the security guard kicking out a few prior one who dropped drugs on the way out   Too bad the next closest McDonalds was under repair  Drive thru only
12117,1,Very busy place you wait for your food The place is a mess and the staff is hardly personal
8804,1,Like a box of chocolate you may get good service or terrible service Out of the 5 times I have gone their over a 3 week span I recieved decent service once I recomend to avoid  this store
26877,1,Unhealthy and poisonous food Acidic lack of nutrients Nothing but fat and carbohydrates Food should be illigal period
8807,1,This McDonalds has really gone to   The service Ignored After finally ordering They dont take the time to bring you your order or even call out your damn number Coffee sucks Oh And their security  Whoever is hiring them should be fired with their security Total Aholes who treat you like youre loitering after 5 minutes Total judgmental Aholes DONT VISIT THIS MCDONALDS
26874,1,Long wait times for simple orders Poor management Unacceptable cleanliness standards
25049,1,Horrible slow and unhelpful
12110,1,GET RID OF THE COMPUTERIZED FOUNTAIN DRINK MACHINE
12109,1,Terrible curbside service  Not busy and everyone had to wait at least 20 minutes for a small order
25050,1,No vegetarian options
8805,1,This stores employees purposely turn off and reset their delivery systems payments if they dont feel like doing their job Absolutely horrid staff and all should be replaced
8775,1,"1200 am  Wait 10 minutes behind the car in front of me
1210 am  Sever Cash only our system is down and rebooting
Me thats fine
Sever ok what can we get for you
Me number one medium with lemonade please
Sever hold on one moment
Me ok
Sever
Me
1212 Me hello
1215 Silence
1220 Silence

Thats when I left One car was at the window and at least 12 in line to order Its always something here No coffee at 6 am Out of fries Cash only 30 minute wait with nothing to show for it Super frustrating If you are down to test your patience give this location a shot"
8795,1,The area is surrounded by homeless people so there is a strict 30minute time limit on eating inside the restaurant The bathrooms are locked and even asking multiple times to use one I was not given access My fiance found some kind of blueish chunk in his burger and that ended it for us Nice and clean but unfriendly staff and atmosphere and frightening food
8793,1,Terrible experience with this McDonalds Employees dont care about nothing dear manager you are doing great job 
12127,1,Just awfulremember when Mcds was good food quality I actually donow they really do suck
8778,1,I pull up to drive thru and told to wait a moment I wait 30 minutes to place order still nobody takes my order I pull up to window thinking maybe I was forgotten I honking horn employees looks at me and walks away I stay there for another 15 minutes waiting and still nobody takes my order And all the while I watch at least 12 other cars pull up to drive thru sit and wait and eventually leave cause nobody is taking orders If your not going to do your job as an employee of McDonalds let the customers know so they dont have to wait  for nothing By the way I had to give one star to post this Other wise they would get 5 stars
8779,1,Customer service is horrible Customer isnt right here There correct and your wrong when they screw up an order
12126,1,I had to wait 25 minutes for a breakfast sandwich service very slow there and most of the food Ive gotten from there since then has been cold
8781,1,"Just ordered 2 BigMacs one with no lettuce
Had NO sauce  the other had  a teaspoon worth on the edge of the burger
Fries were meh"
8782,1,This has got to be hands down one of the worst McDonalds restaurants around Their service is downright abysmal Also they are extremely highpriced I do have to say that their food does live up to McDonalds standards But by the time you fight off the homeless people deal with the bad customer service and pay exorbitant prices this location just isnt worth it  One other thing of note This location does not honor the surveys for the buy one get one free
8783,1,I have never encountered a restaurant so rude before We arrived there at 1053 they close at 11 I know its tabu to show up at a restaurant right before close but we were 6 hours away from home and hungry Not only were the doors already locked but the three employees plus a security guard would not come to the door or even acknowledge we were there Locking the doors early when your signs state your hours is unexceptable
26881,1,Says 24h but they were closed at 2am including the drive through
8784,1,Had my car booted by 2 of the dumbest people I have ever met while my girl friend was buying a soda and I was buying wine for a lovely night  There are 3 total signs displaying this premise but 2 are on the opposite side of the lot and one is not reflective for their 710 night shift of bootingtowing  The signs also say people who arent patrons will be booted which I by extension was My night was spent arguing with the employees and the tow company instead  I recommend a wholehearted boycott
8786,1,"Extremely rude lady in the morning I spoke to her with a smile and that did not deter her from the destain she showed from what I assume because she had to serve me Waaay too many other McDonalds around for me to need to deal with that in the morning
If you see a short Asian lady with a grey uniform shirt do not bother she will just make your morning worse"
8787,1,Would give zero starts if I would they all have an ugly attitude as if I was responsible for them working there I asked for a caramel macchiato and they said the machine wasnt working Then the person behind me or
8788,1,"I would like to preface with the statement that I am a fairly hardcore proponent of the proletariat With that said the fact that they force you to utilize the kiosk must me some kind of self sabotage If people are willing to pay at the counter then it could drive down demand for the kiosk

Secondly there is a heavyset woman with glasses that gets mad and angry when customers ask for stuff and has to forward it to the manager every time yelling loud enough for rhe lobby not to mention she hovers over the lobby while people are eating i get that you want to catch mess early or clean the tables quick I have worked food service before but do not hover around people trying to eat like some kind of table patrol

Fortunately the security guard is calm and collected I mean generally if youre on the clock where else do you have to be

Service is inconsistent per the usual horrible with Uber eats drivers and seem intent on the self destructive goal of sabotage my job"
12124,1,Was not at all impressed Very rude Clean establishment how ever needs much improvement on customer service
8790,1,Been waiting in a long line for the past 15 minutes Pull up to the window to pay and the employee with the long blue fake nails is messing around on their phone watching YouTube No wonder it was taking forever
8791,1,"The place is disgusting in terms of cleanliness Full of homeless people on heroin We actually threw the food in the garbage after we paid for it  It looked nasty and dangerously filthy Parking lot outside is full of shady people checking out what is in your car When we were leaving we saw about 15 people laying on the sidewalks totally stoned from some drug
Wouldnt recommend at all"
25041,1,Bad service
8785,1,This place always has the door lock so you can not get in to the restaurant
11610,1,Crazy slow and disorganized
8906,1,They refuse to take inside orders  will tell you to use the Keyosk   that thats the way it is now theres no baby changing station in the mens rest rooms They dont have dollar drinks this place is rude  I think it stinks
25115,1,Terrible
9018,1,The McDonalds employee straight up lied toy face when I ordered something and asked them to make an order special to accommodate my needs  McDonalds needs to reevaluate customer service
26780,1,Worst McDonalds ever Staff try but automated and crowded
26779,1,Went in here to us the restroom since im working outside got a no Thank you coffee been for the yes To show my appreciation I bought a drink
9021,1,Worst experience at a McDonalds restaurant Dont waist your money at this location  Recommend going somewhere else
26778,1,Slow All The Time I have never come to this location and quickly got my good and out its always this long process just for my order to be wrong  I wish they put in the attention to detail that the Studio City location puts in
9024,1,they skip me 2 times and they took for ever  to give me my food to the point they forgot what i order well not be going to that one ever again
9025,1,Worst service employees are rude and disrespectful don
11951,1,We are frequent customers of this restaurant  While the food was good the inside was a mess  Every garbage can was overflowing with stacks of garbage piled up on all of them  The tables were littered with paper and garbage There were papers all over the floor even by the register  At the drink station there were scattered cups and catsup splattered on the counter and floor  Counter service was excruciatingly slow  Since we really like the renovation and usually great service we will probably give it one more shot  We were there almost a half hour and so no one in the front cleaning  Hopefully they can address and correct the problem
26776,1,Never a correct order  last night they forgot to put patties on both kids hamburger buns the kitchen timers are always beeping not very clean parking is limited Staff is friendly Kids like it so well continue to come here
11949,1,Always doublecheck your order when you get it Be patient So many irate customers here Its unreal If you come during a busy time use the selfserve kisoks I have never seen them open more than one register since the remodel All of the excellent staff were let go when they rebuilt the store and didnt come back This particular store is the best argument for a 20 minimum wage Maybe if people earned more they might be more motivated or they could hire people who are enthusiastic
9029,1,I was about to walk in but every door was locked I called and they hung up on me
9030,1,Bad customer service Manager flipped me off because i didnt know the menu
11947,1,Worst coffee drink in my whole life literally threw up in the parking lot  threw it away after 1 sip I dont plan on coming here again
11940,1,We grabbed dinner Sunday evening 2 x 2 cheese burger meals and 1 chicken nugget happy meal We jumped back on the road to head home to peru after a hockey game We opened our yellow cheese burger wrappers to find all 4 cheese burgers were missing the cheese What a disappointment after a long day and drive
11938,1,A complete joke I told them I wanted a medium meal they charged me for a large and when I asked it to be fixed they said ok and didnt fix it  I will never go there again then when I asked for ranch I was told they didnt have any but my girlfriend went in and asked for it up front and they gave it to her  I would of gave 0 if possible 
11953,1,In a rush to get a lunch after 7 hours of work and the cashier takes an employee before me even  though I was next in line No biggie until the employee orders something so messed up the cashier has to ask someone how to punch it in and then needs help again to give the employee the discount Ive never had a good experience at this McDonalds
9016,1,The Security gaurd was rude and dismissive and for the second time now the man at the pick up window completley ignored us even though OUR food was ready and gave  tried to give us the wrong order
9014,1,Honestly worst McDonalds drive thru in salt lake Whether it
9013,1,They should probably prepare for the midnight and after rush that they seem to get EVERY night  It cant be a surprise  5 minutes waiting just to order
26790,1,didn
26788,1,Took 40 whole minutes from the time I entered the drive through before I got my food
8997,1,They always overcook the nuggets and now the tenders horrible
11975,1,They took the fast out of fast food today Always pull ahead at window 2 I remember when you use get your food from that window If the machine breaks down we break down
11974,1,During a severe thunderstorm I told my son to pull over and get indoors He was right near Mcdonalds in Champlain and he went in and ordered some food After he got his food they kicked my son out and said he couldnt hang around due to covid right in the middle of the worst part of the storm Use some common sense Mcdonalds and have a heart
11970,1,This place seriously needs some funding from the head office to renovate and modernize the dinning area Washrooms are deplorable Considering the amount of Canadian traffic that passes through Champlain I believe most would like a pit stop for lunch while traveling down to the states a renovation would be warranted and I think most people would enjoy eating here more often
11968,1,"These people cant get an order straight to save their lives We went in with an order that was WRITTEN DOWN CLEARLY and was very precise 3 times we had to go back to the counter The last time my sand which was dropped on the floor picked up wiped off put in the container and handed to me I got the entire incident captured on my phone and when I confronted the person they denied my sandwhich even fell This place is all around terrible Save yourself the risk of salmonella poisoning and drive the 18 miles to Plattsburgh Your health will thank you Id give zero stars if it were possible

 21719
Here We freaking go again Tried one last time tonight was very specific with our order which wasnt very hard to begin with and guess what A complete and total failure These people just dont Care Do yourself A favor and drive the extra miles to Plattsburgh"
9037,1,Lobby closed on Sunday  Only open MonSat 92
9002,1,They should probably update their signs so that we know the times theyre actually open
9005,1,They charge me for umsweet  ice coffee even I never have coffee in whole life also they charge me twice from my card because I handover my card to cashier
26786,1,Terrible floor was disgusting and no one cleaned it after asking even the tables were left a mess that my family had to clean ourselves Unfriendly atmosphere and employees looked at us in anger despite just walking in Would not recommend anyone this establishment
11965,1,Worst service in years 10pm at night Only car in the drive thru 20 minutes for chicken tenders and fries No explanation given We are working on it The teams teenage friends inside however were getting personalized service with their coffees
11964,1,Since their new building has opened it takes FOREVER to get your food Its supposed to be fast food and it takes 2030 minutes in the drive through and then they gave my kids toddler toys when I did not ask 
11962,1,It was horrible order from inside and it was a 27 min wait for food Ridiculous for 3 meals
11959,1,Horrible manager there  a woman by the name of Marsha I believe  or start with  an M i I v Been waiting for the food for 15 mins and she tells me if I dont want to wait I should leave  How can a manager tells this I am sure there is some sort of conduct policy or else she wouldnt been a manager
11957,1,"Wow This McDonalds is beyond awful So many bad experiences

For one outside the place smells like a landfill The inside is covered in flies and old decorations from months ago Every table is dirty the bathrooms are atrocious and the garbage is overflowing If that were tolerable the food certainly is it Theres always something wrong with the order or the food is old and stale or overcooked We have had multiple issues with their soft drinks machine Either the soda is warm there is no carbonation or both If someone suggests I go to this McDonalds again Ill kindly tell them Ill eat my own foot after trouncing around in manure Theres no reason that cheap food has to be so lacking in quality"
11966,1,This place has the worst service they kept giving us the wrong order and actually had his pay for someone elses the area took a while to correct and then we still had to wait for our food for another 10 minutes or so This was all done through the drivethru and I expected better service the New York City from this place but I definitely didnt get it the food actually wasnt that good either I remember feeling sick after I got home later so I definitely dont recommend going to this McDonalds
9039,1,Food always tastes like its sat under a warmer for 3hrs
9041,1,Terrible service and the person working the drive through had issues understanding my order due to a language barrier
9042,1,My last visit there was disdisgusting I went to the bathroom one of the stalls there was crap everywhere in it on the toilet seat and then I went to the other one and there was blood on the walls Im never gonna to back and the customer service was not that great
26765,1,The rudest and least compentent staff Ive ever found at a Mcdonald
11911,1,"Extremely slow when I passed yesterday around noon Order came without any napkins Dispenser beside soft drink fountain was empty Ask for some napkins at the counter and got 1  one 
How cheap can you get
Garbage cans beside the entrance were overflowing
Can not recommended at all"
11910,1,Doors say they open at 6am Thats a lie At 630 still locked Nobody answering the phone constant busy signal management if youre not going to open the doors for din
11904,1,Awful service Id starve before I eat at this location again Person working the cash had no idea what they were doing Others standing around not doing anything Door was locked in the middle of the afternoon so people couldnt come into the lobby to order No ice available for your drink Do yourself a favour and find another location to eat at
9073,1,Sucks Consistently makes hardovercookeddry food Fries are never salted Tea is whack asf
9074,1,Picture very dissatisfied with this location they do not value customer service I do not appreciate being forced to use a mechanical device to order my food I want to talk to human being when I order
11902,1,Obviously not enough  staff working  Ice machine was broke  We had to go up to counter and ask for a couple things missing from our order  Things were a mess
11912,1,Havent seen a McDonalds so lost in my life 
9076,1,People here are hostile and not safe choose a different location please
25195,1,Terrible
11897,1,I came there to pick up order around 5 in the morning there was a managerbrown hair who dealt with me very rudely i politely requested for my uber pick up but he showed me attitude and just shut the window That was an awful experience for me and i would like to suggest them to show some etiquettes and respect towards their customers I also work in a restaurant and know how to deal with the customers and uber orders
9080,1,Warning Use drivethru ONLY There is a Predatory Towing Company ABC Towing  that WILL boot your car And force you to pay CASH ONLY to have the boot removed
11895,1,Food was slow Manager short hair woman was having a mental breakdown or something and was being rude She needs to be fired Her name was Elizabeth or something Very unprofessional
9082,1,Was treated like a number only Food was ok but not the best hard around the edges my food was kind of thrown at me not a good experience
9084,1,The so called manager was mean as hell they told us that the ice cream machine was broken but we literally watch them make the ice cream and we saw a guy walk away with four McFlurrys and told us shes gonna call dispatch
25220,1,Terrible
9077,1,Made me pay 129 to use the restroom won
8994,1,No customer service skills Every time ive been there they have been rude for no good reason
9065,1,When the sign says 24 hours its not okay for the cashier to refuse to serve a customer Will be talking to their general manager about this
11914,1,Waiting over 30 minutes to order Then get to the window got my food then it was wrong went in doors were lock only 730 at night all doors were lock All was 4 cheese burgers Went back to drive thru window cuz my order was wrong All they did was scrap it off only wanted pickles and Mac sauce and it was everything on it When took it back just scrap off and gave it back Was nasty
11931,1,Food seems to be getting worse Tables dirty Sketchy crowd loitering within the store
9045,1,Generally pretty fast but panhandlers will often try to approach you while you are in or near the drivethru which is extremely unsafe
9046,1,It was so messy it made  my mom stressed
11923,1,Coming from Montreal this is our first stop after clearing US customer We stopped for breakfast around 930 They did not have the egg steak and cheese bagel In fact they had no bagels at all We ordered the muffing egg meals but got the biscuit meal It also took them a while to get our order
11922,1,The owner of this McDonalds needs to read this  When you have a breakfast special  you should want to please the customer If the customer wants 2 sausage biscuits instead of 2 bacon biscuits  are a customer would prefer a a certain type of bread for there breafast sandwich special you should not put stipulations on what type of bread they want  Other McDonalds have catered to my needs if your not willing to cater to customer needs then you will have less customers  Also charging for ranch not everyone can eat ketchup because of acid and stomach problems and need ranch for there fries instead of ketchup Anyone that says they need ranch for there fries are hashbrown not just chicken nuggets because they have stomach issues you should make exception to that for that  And one last thing  Your workers look miserable not one of them smiles at me im very outgoing person  You need to explain to your workers that there attitudes are sour and need to cheer up We all have bad days but when somone looks like they hate being there based off of there unfriendly customer service then they need more training   Night service is better from my experience but the morning service needs to be looked at  Its not fun to drive up and the worker gives you that look like they hate you and shows no customer service skills at all Thank you for your understanding Take my advice and you will have more customers
9052,1,It was sub par even for McDonalds The bun was stale and hard the ingredients didn

11919,1,This one
11918,1,Incredibly slow wait  Food served was cold  Received partial refund and PERSONAL INSULTS from the crew  You do not need to train such bad staff  Fire them
11917,1,The worst drive threw service After waiting 10 min to order because 2 cars used the left lane drive threw and got served before me then having to wait another 20 min to receive my order to see that the McChicken had sauce when I said no sauce and the cheeseburger wasnt well done like I asked If I could give 0 stars I would A week before 25 min drive threw wait and the food was co
26770,1,Stopped here on the way to LA Every employee i talked to had TERRIBLE customer service Everyone there looks miserable I heard a man ask to enter the mens restroom to just wash his hands while they were cleaning the person cleaning refused and then he asked the lady at the register if he could ask the person cleaning to let him inside the restroom and she told him to go to the womens restroom with a huge attitude Really rude workers

12011,1,Only been there once before today I remember why its horrible had to wait for my food for them to not even give it all to me 
8933,1,Disappointed again The gas station across the street will actually give you what you order and charge you only once for it
8934,1,Very rude pour food quality staff very not concerned with customers management does not have a clue of any policy most of tables were very dirty overall very dingy and not comfortable Also 30 minutes signs stating you must consume your food and leave within 30 minutes from the lobby very rude very poor reflection of McDonalds
8936,1,Garbage service wouldnt serve any of there menu cause of short staff on a Friday night horrible
8937,1,They messed up my order and the apple pie was dry and had some plastic stuck to the bottom of it
8938,1,The service was aweful the food was bad the basic hygiene procedures were not being respected the cashier went from touching money to pick up fries barehanded without washing her hands and Ive been sitting on my toilet for the last 15 minutes slowly dying
12008,1,"The McDonalds in Champlain NY is a great place to grab something to eat and to be honest I just came here last night on my way to Altona to play the slot machines and I really enjoy coming to this McDonalds and its way far better than the one is in my town where I live and its like Night And Day compared to this one and I just as well give this place a 5 Star Rating and the other one is a 1 Star Rating and if I had the opportunity to give it a BIG FAT ZERO I REALLY WOULD AND I DONT THINK THAT ITS FAIR TO REVIEWERS TO HAVE TO GIVE IT A 1 STAR WHEN THEY DONT DESERVE IT

This McDonalds here in Swanton VT is probably the worst place to get so called fast food I go through the drive thru too order my food but before I do go too McDonalds I always make sure that I have a full tank of gas in my car Because by the time I get my food Ive already waisted at least 15 bucks in gas by the time I leave this place I believe that if its going too take a half hour or more to finally get my very Luke Warm Garbage then this McDonalds should not be allowed to call themselves a part of the Fast Food Chain If you want to get something quick to eat then dont go to this McDonalds here in Swanton and their service is terrible and the food is even worse"
26820,1,Slowest drive thru ever avoid at all costs
8940,1,Short line inside but we all had to wait 20 minutes after ordering for a small order It seemed like they just kept serving car after car but made all the people inside wait
12006,1,Normally decent food for a McDonalds restaurant however if you order a frozen drink they make it first so it sits there and melts No matter what time of day its always the same Don
26817,1,Cold burgers disgusting looking and tasting meat the fries were the only 
25137,1,Bad

1925,1,I bought a Big Mac  I was eating And I saw a hair on the meet  never ever going to buy in this place

1923,1,Worse customer service I have ever experienced I dont know how a mobile order can take 30 mins to load on their screen Or why no one can help you at drive thru apparently it would work if you walk into the store No you should get a manager or someone who wants to help instead of people telling you that your holding up their line As far as I though I was still a customer Not everyone would like to go into the store especially with covid Just learn to help people instead of treating people like cattle
1921,1,I just walked in to get myself some breakfast and was told that theyre closed that they cant turn the registers on yet Why is a place known for serving breakfast closed at 730 am Seems pretty unprofessional
1901,1,Very rude and nasty people at the inside counter no help or patience for people who are old and not computer savvy At the drive through they messed up my order and charged me for what I hadnt ordered The lady manager was nice though

21125,1,It was a ridicously long time to get my food   There is ONLY 2 people working here   The person at the drivethrough window is having to go back and forth to take orders inside as well   The selfserve soda fountain machines are turned off so I have to wait until the drivethrough guy eventually makes his way to the inside counter to get a refill  I have never seen a fast food restaurant so under staffed
1905,1,Ordered pick up and when I got home realized 3 items were missing almost half the order How you complete an order and not make sure youre putting everything the customer paid for Never ordering from here

Caroline o wherever name was the supervisor on duty was rude and upset because she said they made the order and understood mkstakes happens it

You guys need to ask for the tickets that helps alot to prevent this kind of mistakes
Also please put a sign if you guys are not droping the food to the table so we know we have to wait for the food at the counter

Very disappointed breakfast"
1909,1,"This was possibly the worst experience Ive had at a McDonalds
First they give me the wrong order which was fine but then they asked me for my receipt which no one ever gave me in the first place thinking Im there to steal a few burgers
Then I was asked to swing around back to the pay station At this point 20 minutes had past just waiting We were then asked to pay yet again meanwhile the young woman we initialed paid with took our card and charged it There was a line of incorrect items and people waiting to get their"
21127,1,The drive through staff is very unprofessional they leave you sitting at the speaker box waiting to place an order they have a very rude attitude when taking your order and they act like it is an inconvenience for you to be there This is already a very overpriced McDonalds because of the strip location Find a better place to visit for something to eat its not worth the hassle here
21129,1,I wanted to eat McDonalds near Mandalay Bay The Asian lady was so rude I was ready to give my order to her she says oh youre not ready and walked away she refused to take my order not once but 2 times She was running around like she was on meth She looked confused so I left because shes rude

21148,1,The sign says they open at 5 am for lobby but it
1945,1,"Check your food before you leave

21175,1,This location deserves a zero star rating Please dont go here Even if youre starving to death I wanted 1 hour and 20 mins for 2 combos and 2 extra Sandwiches Ironically as much as the wait was bad it was the attitude of some of the team members that made this experience extremely terrible McDonalds corporate really needs to come here and train thestaff for hospitality This location is a disgrace to what Donalds has boult over the years
1987,1,The managers are bad They get your order wrong most of the time Do not walk out without checking your bag 15 minute wait at night The Filipino manager doesnt know anything and usually have to be reminded by staff Need to stick to Burger King These other people posting positive things apparently work there because all you see is people returning with their order
1968,1,Ordered a 6 piece nugget received 5 pieces inflation to damn high for McDonalds to be playing with my nuggets
1966,1,New building same poor service Frankly for service to be this bad for this long it becomes harder to blame the workers and easier to blame management Went to the drivethrough at 2am and ordered some value menu sandwichesafter waiting nearly 20 minutes for them to process a single order with three cars in front of me I decided to leave Their credit card machine is also down intermittently
31999,1,Cold food

1837,1,Horrible service from the manager I got 2 cheeseburgers from the drive thru and my bag was leaking with some fluid Looked inside and both was soaked in oil The burger was drenched in oil and the wrapper had puddles of oil inside it and once i opened it it went on my pants and console of my car Went inside to get another burger but instead the manager tried to justify saying she did it herself and it wasnt like that and that it just came out But I tried to explain there was so much oil everywhere that when I tried to pick up the burger it slips right out of my hand and the oil is spilling everywhere Even when I got a new burger she still insisted on justifying why it was like that instead of apologizing to a customer Ive never had that experience with just trying to eat a cheeseburger Not even a restaurant does that Didnence was

1846,1,The worst McDonalds and its not even the place its the employees Not all but the majority of them can NEVER get the order right Either they give you the wrong order or theyre are items missing Like ALWAYS I order from door dash and every f time I receive it there are items missing the last time I ordered a Medium Fries and literally half of it was filled Rip you off It takes forever to get your order as well I understand they have a lot of customers but hello be considerate and get the orders right

1888,1,Too many noisy homeless gangsters there making me very uncomfatable
21113,1,Stop here only if youre desperate  We came by late and hardly anyone was in the restaurant yet they were still extremely slow  We waited about 30 minutes for 6 orders  You order on screens instead of with a person and the system still feels like its in a beta mode  On the bright side you can get booze next door while you wait
1890,1,"There is a major problem with this McDonalds I have been coming here for years and I put up with alot of inconveniences Non the less last night was appalling Whats wrong with the girl cashier tan skin black hair the Hispanic or Indian girl with the yellow long press on nails Im sure you can single her out of the crowd I wont say her name even though they all kept saying eachothers names out loud like it was high school musical back there Is it mandatory for her to not give me my receipt I  like many other hardworking Americans who have been coming here for as long as we all can remember  need a receipt especially just incase how fast food workers forget to give us all of our order and wouldnt you know it not only did they fail to give me my receipt  but they failed to give me the correct order I asked for my order more than three times Is it also part of the owners of McDonalds policy to berate the customer in Spanish Im Puerto Rican and I understand everything they was saying How rude to have said all of that in front of the customer  and about the customer  Is this how you value your rewards members Im going to post about my experience on any social media platform Mark my words I would also like to state that the woman manager allowed her staff to keep acting maliciously and she acted as if nothing was going wrong Is this how you run your establishment
The African American fellow tall with a kind of lisp gave me again the wrong order and the wrong receipt Must be nice to pick out the garbage a receipt from three hours ago to give to me thinking i wouldnt know the difference The owner should pop on in Must Like losing out on money
Many thumbs down Im going to spend my money elsewhere Zero stars"
17789,1,Terrible
21119,1,Placed a mobile order for pickup Waited 15 minutes for a single burger that never got called All of that wouldnt be so bad but when I called for a refund I was lied to by the manager that they called my order which they did not I stood inside for 15 minutes watching the counter to see if they had my order So they lied and kept my money
21120,1,PLEASE CHECK YOUR TO GO ORDERS BEFORE YOU LEAVE I would give negative stars if I could I ordered a to go order but ended up staying to eat in the dining room  I opened my quarter pounder hamburger and it was turned upside down with all of the toppings splattered onto the box as if it was slapped in there It literally had no top hamburger bun and when I brought this up to the cashier she said that this is what a quarter hamburger was When I asked for just a top hamburger bun at least and showed the cashier the burger she didnt even apologize or offer to remake the burger she just snatched the box out of my hands I paid for this burger and was only asking for the bun not making a scene or demanding anything or being rude I had chosen to not acknowledge the mess it was because there are enough verbally abusive patrons But all the cashier ended up doing was turn the burger right side up no gloves and slap an undercooked bun on it and yell at the other adult woman at the grill about whats missing here It wasnt even busy in the drive thru or the dining room I cant pretend to know their job or lives but I hope they arent this effed up to every PAYING customer I ended up asking for a refund and not taking the burger even this was an issue Please beware I only regret not getting their names to report them Again not trying to be  a drama queen but I worked hard to afford this little splurge to get this slap in the face

21264,1,This place completely ignores the folks that come inside They will focus on the Drive thru and thats it Dont expect much from Macdonalds to start with but this REALLY lowered the bar
21266,1,"The lady in front of me had a coupon for an ice coffee or something and the order taker thought it was for a regular coffee So the manager comes over and tells the lady she needs to pay an extra dollar to get the ice coffee  The lady customer then shows her the coupon which must have made the manager mad because she sternly tells the order taker to give her her ice coffee 

Then she rudely tells everyone in line to go use the kiosk  that theyll no longer take orders the normal way
Id already stood in line almost 10 minutes and was next but that didnt matter

Ever since they changed this McDonalds around a couple of months ago and got new management the service to me has been terrible which really sucks because for over 2 years now this is where I mostly take my breaks
After tonight I will no longer buy food from the McDonalds on the Strip at four seasons"

2032,1,What can we say about McDonalds as a whole This place inparticular is nasty Yes I do come in for coffee but I try to limit myself to that Homeless hang out here not saying they should be kicked to the curb but the place smells The workers are ok except there is this one woman that has been there for like 2 years and has not mastered the art of the register Dont come here about 3pm high school kids are nuts Anyway I know this isnt new to lots of people but It was fun writing it Thanks Next time ill make coffee at home

21189,1,Not open on the inside and its 518am second McDonalds this morning still not open
21188,1,"The food was horrible Didnt bring our food to us like the kiosk said they do We had to go get it Meat on the big Mac were super thin and chunks of meat missing We brought to theyre attention and they made a new ono which had cracks through the meat and way too much lettuce Dry too
Never again will I go there and not recommend going there"
1992,1,The worst experience ever I was cursed at by an angry female employee Which i heard from the other employees that she has done this before They said the manager and her are either family or real good friends
1994,1,We usually bought in this McDonalds but after a really bad service with the server I didnt come back anymore also I try to solve my problem with the manager and he started yelling at me I told him dont worry I will make a complaint with the Corporation but this not work neither The woman who answered said every owner train their manager to know how to deal Then I come few days later and the forget my ranch I said I will pay extra and they said no sorry only one is the only I can give you And every time I come I buy 3 kids meal because my kids are 3 Thewomantook the complaint but never contact me Rude employees I pay for 3 kids meal I was in the restaurant eating they forget my chicken nuggets in the 3 orders thewomanwho took my order found then the hispanicsy for that Never you will see me here again we go to another McDonalds close to our house theres no kids playground but they treat you better
1995,1,Worst place ever Young man on speaker does not listen to order and does not type it on the reciet all the time girls in front are always lost and if something is written on the receipt they still dont read it They also get annoyed when you ask for stuff to be fixed like more cream in coffee or a sauce you did not which goes with the meal that was on the receipt etc Also very sloppy throw food in bag upside down like nuggets or tenders  also dont wrap the sandwiches well and the papers all greasy ketchup on top of fries Always try to get orders out on an unrealistic timer ever for a fast food place and once that happens they close out the order and make you pull to the side to wait for food while 3 4 people behind get to leave with there orders Its ridiculous Just give the whole order at the window this isnt a race and people everywhere else have to wait there turn to complete there orders and go The weekend crew is even worse
21180,1,Called to complain about the utter mess of an order I received Out of 4 sandwiches they were all wrong Not edible to my family I am handicapped with the use of only one leg and this restaurant was the closest I was able to walk to  During the phone call the manager wanted me to walk back to the restaurant to handle the situation I just asked for a refund and she said no cant do that walk back I would like my refund and she should be fired
1998,1,I wish I can give this a zero star The employees fight over the food order honestly the worst McDonalds place ever They even charge 25 cents for barbecue sauce while other McDonald restaurants just lend it over to you with respect
1999,1,Very slow drive thru They pretended to accept and acknowledge my coupon when I placed my  order When I pulled up to pay they charged me full price without telling me that they never input the coupon Find another location  because the people here dont do the job properly n

21186,1,Eating McDonalds burgers in the United States is the worst time because the chicken inside has been fried repeatedly and it has reached the point where it can hardly be chewed
2009,1,"I think this is the worst Mac Donalds I have been to  The worst customer service A Spanish guy supposedly to be the Manager was very rude to customers taking orders and was very  rude and nasty to  the employees giving orders

He took my order and he didnt even know the menu Gave the wrong order
And he talked nasty to customers

I think  MacDonalds head quarters should go and check up on this place specially on give a  training to employees and managers in how to  give an excellent service But this is not a plasent place to have a Burger

Sorry for me I let my money there Shame on you MacDonalds"

2038,1,I went to McDonalds on Kissena Blvd in Kew Gardens Hills today and ordered an ice cream cone  They said they have no cones they can give me a cup  I said ok  When I get to the cashier she charges me for a sundae  I said to her why are you charging me for a sundae when i am just getting ice cream  She said thats the only other option I am charging you for a plain sundae  I reiterated that a sundae is defined by ice cream with topping  The cashier made me over pay for my ice cream in a cup I didnt get a topping but she made me pay for one
21209,1,25 minutes of awaiting for order because staff only serves Drive Through line In such busy location like this one they should change management for one who will be able to organize work there in proper way

21214,1,Even with the shockingly low bar McDonalds has set this particular location fails to meet even that expectation It feels post apocalyptic in here All doors except one are locked but not marked The floor doesnt look like its been cleaned in weeks My shoes stuck to the floor so strongly that one pulled off To top it all off the staff were rude to several customers who were confused by the disabled ordering systems

18230,1,I usually defend fast food joints even McDonalds Not a very picky person However this visit to this location was very disappointing Defying all logic it took a very long time to get my food around noon on a Tuesday despite few cars The employees were emotionless and seemed to be rushing you through even though it still took a long time And then to top it off they got my order wrong
32349,1,I ordered food the first time and they missed two items then I got a refund and ordered it again and they got my order completely wrong I asked for it make flurry and a 10 piece chicken McNugget and they gave me a six piece spicy chicken McNugget and didn

1547,1,Terrible
32346,1,Customer service was terrible After waiting five minutes just to try and place our order we decided just to drive up to the window to place our order Once we got to the window the young lady that was suppose to be taking orders for the drive thru was just on her phone texting The sense of urgency was nonexistent All we wanted was a large fries and sweet tea 
32345,1,I have been in line for an hour to get 2 Quarter pounders meals What ever happened to FAST FOOD This is ridiculous I have a starving child at home
32344,1,The general manager of this location had the worst customer service I have ever experience I order food  it was cold He initially didnt wanna give me fresh food or a refund I sat at the drive Thur almost 30 minutes waiting  Once he seen I wouldnt leave he gave me back partial payment and then called the police on me I

32337,1,Just horribly slow Waited 10 minutes to get to the order screen at the drive thru even though only two cars ahead of us in the right lane It took another 40 minutes to get my kids food It really makes no sense
32335,1,Id give it zero starts if I could The drive through only had two cars ahead of me to order and in total it took an hour It took ten minutes no exaggeration at the order board for someone to take my order When i get to the window he didnt know what i had and literally just then put my order in It was not that busy at all and it had at least 4 people working At the window he took my card for about two minutes and i froze my bank account just in case

18237,1,"Really frustrated with this location I usually go to the location off of Beach street and order the same thing every time I go there I know exactly how much my order should be I stop here because I happened to be closer to this location than to my normal one and order my usual 2 McDoubles I had just enough change in my wallet to pay for my order Or so I thought Instead of paying 150  2  25  325 I was charged 199 for ONE Mcdouble It may not seem like much but to someone who is on the go and on a budget I expect ome of the biggest fast food chains to at the very least be consistent with their prices I wonder how much Ive over paid at this location in the past
What made me most upset was that I didnt recieve a receipt for my order So in order to determine why I paid 215 after tax for ONE Mcdouble I went inside to the self ordering in the lobby and looked it up myself I dont appreciate not being told my total at the speaker not beinzing I didnt even receive one to begin with when I pulled forward from the pick up window It should be standard procedure to give a receipt for the sake of the overpaying customers"
32351,1,The worst McDonald i came across Just takes them mire than 20 minutes from order to receive Hope the building burns down
18243,1,If I could give them no stars I would they have been messing up my order for years Remodel didnt help nothing  still sucks Ive complained to a district manager  dont help Ive had 1 nice manager  but she still got my order wrong I swear at one point I thought I was on boiling point or there was a hidden camera Cuz they got my order wrong 3xs in s row this place is A JOKE
32367,1,"I move close to this unit ordered via app to avoid the drive thru line but for my surprise when I went to get my order that was ready I was forced to take an hour in the drive thru line

This is supposed to be fast food

When I went to pick up my order the drinks were wrong the potatoes were the wrong size and old the Sundae machine was broken they didnt deliver our sundaes and the attendance was super rude saying that the problem was mine and not hers burgers were in the correct Double Quarter Ponder box but when we got home there were cheeseburgers and the third burger wasnt in the bag

The amount charged on my card by the Mc Donalds app was greater than the closing of the order

I made a complaint to customer service that notified the unit but unfortunately no concrete action will be taken

Never had a more disappointed experience estaurant again"
32366,1,Second time in less than 2weeks apart More than 20 minutes waiting in the drive thru because these guys take the wrong orders A complete disaster
20644,1,Very slow and rude
20645,1,McDonalds is unhealthy food
32363,1,They never have anything  Their Menu is always crossed out and when you order something
20647,1,O star
18227,1,I went through the drivethru and ordered 3 cheese burgers I waited in line for like 10 minutes I get to the window and they told me to park because my food wasnt ready It wasnt even busy so I didnt understand why it took so long to make 3 cheeseburgers After waiting in my car for 10 more minutes I went inside to get a refund since I had to go back to work and I just wasted 20 minutes waiting for food As soon as I ask for a refund one of the employees walks up with my food and hands it to me I guess they forgot I was waiting on it I will never come back to this location
32362,1,DO NOT GO As soon as I got in I got yell at by one of their employees to get out and go to through the drive thru I told her I did not have a car and she told me to wait in the line anyways I standed in the line for cars and they took forever to make any orders After  my order was done they made me wait on the sidewalk and let other cars go ahead of me just because I was not in a car The two cars behind me had bigger orders I am talking 23 delivery bags They yelled at me they basically threw the food at me and I left with the worst experience Is not fast food if you have to wait 30 minutes just to order
32360,1,"I never leave reviews but I had to here

Honestly if you visited every single McDonalds in the country and ranked them I am convinced this one would be dead last

I spent an hour in the drivethru and when I got to the window it took 10 minutes before anyone even came to the window and when they did they had no idea what I had ordered

I have never seen a group of people move so slowly and with such little purpose or interest  in what they were doing It seems like they were just annoyed to be working at all Literally it looked like the whole crew was moving in slow motion it was a sight to see

Then when I finally did get my food the order it was of course not correct But the weird thing is they didnt short me they gave me an extra quarter pounder and fries

I am just visiting and will never go there again anyways but "
32359,1,Not 24 hours more so when I feel like working especially late night They sit inside and let a line build up and dont respond to multiple hellos I dont get it Customer service does not exist
32357,1,Terrible In line for over an hour and my whole order was messed up First they told me over the drive thru intercom that they dont do the coupon on the app then told me to pull around after taking my order Make matters worse was the one worker kept scratching her hair her hoody on her head then take it off and scratch hair again Not once did she wash her hands but had the nerve to be mad at me because your coworker didnt ring up the order correctly Definitely will not be coming back to this one Im glad Im on my way back home to Texas so I can get some Southern Hospitality
32356,1,If you like to have your order messed up having people mumbling at you and dont care about getting any sauce with your nuggets this place is for you The crack heads hanging out in the drive through is also a nice touch although based on my experience those might just be workers on their break Oh and the fries  so old and stale they would make a great 
32354,1,We wait in the line for over 20 min When we arrive 2 employees were outside the store speaking The worst drive thru service ever
1536,1,Terrible
32353,1,Was basically out of half the menu Then we had them repeat back our 56 dollar order to us twice and once we got back to our hotel 2 sandwiches were missing While paying with my card through the drive thru the cashier said I had to give her my pin number because the pad didnt reach out the window Ive NEVER had something like that happen to me anywhere in my life Not a single employee had on a uniform Just a total messed up experience

32314,1,I rarely eat at mcdonalds but for convenience and the 40 min drive I had to take home I decided to give it a shot it was 1020 pm and went to the drive thru the lady told me that they were not going to take orders until 11 pm but it says 24 hrs isnt it While I gave the round about I saw all the staff just sitting and chilling in the dining area look I understand its not the best job but at least try anyway do not try to go between 1011 pm because you are not going to be attended
32313,1,"This is by far THE worst McDonalds I have ever been too They  consistently deliver poorly McDonald service and food  menu item

32319,1,Depressing  very sad memorial evidencing what happened during the Holocaust period
32320,1,Worst mcdonalds ever this morning I went inside no cashier they told me to use kiosk to order my food I ordered and then had to wait 30 minutes this was so crazy and then I asked to speak with a manager and then I had to wait about another 15 min and then no staff members would speak English They all need an attitude adjustment I will never ever go to this Mcdonalds again never ever had to wait 45 min for a cup of coffee Please dont go and spend your money here

32418,1,Customer service here always at its worse I get that they probably dont get paid enoughbut they dont seem to realize that theyre not giving good customer service You get what you give 
20610,1,Food was cold and old
32419,1,Never again clueless manager with no management skills or understanding that you aid where your employees lack because she just stood there during the holdup Never again
32431,1,"If I could give 0 stars I would
Food not fresh not the right configuration
Staff dude handed me an oreo Mcflurry without making sure the cap was on properly and it went all over my car Asked for a manager and he said there was none ok dude if you say so
Drivethru menu half the screen was off and the drive thru lady could not comprehend that  even as I pulled into the store and told her She didnt get what was happening

I cant believe McDonalds would let a franchisee get away with this locations issues"
18316,1,I walk into the store in Roanoke TX and the employee is sitting on the counter and leaning on the cups with his but touching them I wonder where else hes been sitting at maybe where the food is made
18314,1,Twice I ordered the quarter pounder deluxe meal and when I get back to work to eat no lettuce and tomatoes  Come on
20597,1,The staff is unfriendly and very slow
1435,1,The fries were overcooked and tasted burnt and the staff didnt offer any resolution
32427,1,"The self service kiosks need to go CUSTOMER SERVICE is lacking because of them When you prefer to speak to a live person its as if youve inconvenienced them They do not listen while your ordering and have to repeat your order like 3x I asked for an iced caramel macchiato and was asked if I wanted it hot or cold ICED then was asked what flavor CARAMEL

REALLY"
20602,1,staff very rude not clean
32402,1,terrible service waited about 1 hour for nothing my order was completely wrong My iced caramel latte was extremely far from good and they don
32426,1,watch out for the jesse pinkman looking dude outside he
32424,1,The worst experience  Staff and management ignored the customers Talked to each other  Took 10 minutes to order  Then 10 minutes to get my food  No apology  Management watched and said nothing during this whole ordeal  Total rude and unprofessional
32422,1,I placed my mobile order they made me wait 30 minutes in the drive thru before I could get my food this is a dump Always a ht show there
20606,1,Cashier was so rude
18305,1,17 minutes in the drive thru   just wow had the order incorrect at the pay window  food was extremely hot so that was nice
1444,1,not good
32421,1,What a joke Parking is awkward went and asked for breakfast  they were out of muffins Okay asked me to wait a few minutes theyll start lunch at 1030 Come up there at 1030 on the dot  they tell me they wont serve lunch until 10451050 because they still have breakfast food left I didnt know the cashiers decide when to serve lunch now
20607,1,Worst one ever slow and rude
32425,1,This is the worst Mc Donalds that I have ever visited Sadly this is the only one which is near my home and sometimes I dont have options to chose another one but today was the last straw I made an order through the app and selected the pickup at the Drive Thru but when I got to the screen where we should order the girl who was there didnt know what to do with my Order Code and when I got to the window and ask for it they didnt know anything neither and they pretended that I went inside because they do not dispatch mobile order by there Also told me that the payment had not come through and I requested to cancel the order but 3 minutes later I was charged with the order that I never got so Im  making this complain because I am pretty upset and disappointed because I always eat in Mc Donalds but in this store is always the same disgusting and poor service at all time or unless when I have gone mornings and nights Also I disputed the charge you made to my credit card because as you noticed I never got it
32371,1,They need to shut down this Mc Donald or sell it to a different management Worst service ever
32401,1,more than two hours waiting and I left without the order rude and drugged staff did not even know what they were doing
32399,1,"Biscayne Blvd and 35th Street
Based upon what I observed and experienced at the drivethru window with 4 employees one who couldnt even understand or speak English I made a complaint to McDonalds yesterday and will wait to hear from someone with the franchise owners organization  The owner needs to know how poorly managed this restaurant is and how inadequately the employees are trained to do their jobs  I also have contacted and submitted a written complaint to Chris Kempczinski CEO of McDonalds as well as Steve Easterbrook who is the President and Chief Executive Officer of McDonalds in Chicago  They need to understand why McDonalds is doing so poorly afterall when they have to communicate to their Board members and investors about a drop in multiple quarterly revenues and earnings over the past year maybe then they will take a look at how poorly they select train and manage their employees to create a positive customer experience with stellar service I will not be going to this or any other McDonalds again  It was that bad  McDonalds corporation needs to do a thorough investigation of how this restaurant is NOT being properly managed by the franchise owner and managers  The owner clearly must put numbers before people  Horrible horrible experience  Will stick with Wendys instead  They have much better food and service

04052021  As a followup to my complaint to McDonalds 1800 and the CEO I did receive a written response and phone call  Kathy was very appreciative of the feedback received and thorough in her explanation of actions taken as a result of a completed investigation  I was also compensated for the experience I had at this McDonalds  I will add that although I had been to this McDonald"
32383,1,Service is slow  The neighborhood is so bad they have security in the lobby  A person has to wonder just how safe is it to stop and dine here  Lock your car  Leave nothing if value in view  Broken window glass in the parking lot
18258,1,Absolute worst service The manager has no control over her employees Absolutely rude and unprofessional
18257,1,God is love but this McDonald dont have love Manager are rude and not professional I order my food instead of her thanking me I thank her  Thats something Jesus will do I will pray for her tho I just dont think its a place to relax and enjoy your family time
18256,1,Crazy manager at this McDonalds abusing customers Ive never been to McDonalds THAT HAS YOUNG latin Manger yelling at customer I was surprised as he hanging out the drivethru window and people just driving away
32381,1,"Ordered a large iced coffee wcream and sugar and an order of hot cakes
Received a medium iced coffee with no sugar And an old pancakes that are basically rubber And to top it off no syrup no butter and a spoon to eat pancakes Definitely wouldnt recommend this location It"
32380,1,Terrible Consistently understaffed Just waited 45 minutes at drive thru Food is disgusting
18254,1,I come here every morning for breakfast on my way to work Ever since they got the Angry Bird eyebrows chick workin the drive through my order is always wrong Not a little wrong like very wrong Today was a simple order of a Coke and a sausage biscuit with strawberry jam But she trys to give me a Frappuccino Then after I clarify what I ordered again I get a Dr pepper instead of a Coke and then grape instead of strawberry This is a everyday occurrence when she is working the drivethru window I even have talked to the shift manger and he laughed it off I cant wait for the new Mc Ds to open on 114 and 35
1506,1,No too bad
32378,1,"They served a bucket of stale oil instead of a clean batch of fries and a filetofish
The patty was stale hard possibly refried and the oil quality was very poor
The fried werent fresh but sometimes this happens with door dash But the quality of the oil and the staleness of the food was unreal
Regret not making the choice for pizza tonight could even eat this food"
32377,1,Disgusting as always  I think they pre make the burgers a day ahead  the bread cheese and the patty is old  fries fells still frozen lol or they wish to be frozen
32375,1,"Update updating to 1 stars Was at the drive through for over 20 mins today Cars were leaving the line bc it wasnt moving Got on the 2 lane and no one came to the speaker I left

Customer Service is terrible Starting from when you get to the ordering screen Drivethru employees never greet you never thank you they look  tired and moody There is one or two exceptions I did look at the name badge because I was surpri"
18250,1,"Honestly I hate to do this but the moment I walked in it smelled like a porta potty and I was like let me just order I ordered 2 hot and spicys NO LETTUCE a large drink and a large fry The Coke was ok the fries like always not full but fresh and I got one sandwich with lettuce and one without I told the kid in the front this sandwich has lettuce one it which prompted him to tell the guy and girl at the grill to please fix it they shrugged their shoulders and pointed at the monitor and said well it only says one sandwich no lettuce

I mean come on guys The kid at the register made an honest mistake and instead of going back and forth with him just fix the dang sand which Dont sit there and argue So the guy in the back snatched the sand which and threw it At that point I asked for a refund little did they know I speak Spanish So when the assistant manager asked me what happened I explained to her and she let out this LOOOONNGG sigh so sorry I am an inconvenience to you but if you were to train your team members some customer service this wouldnt have been an issue Jesus the kid at the register was really nice and well mannered He gets a 5 star But my experience was just horrible"
32373,1,The young ladies that work during the day are too busy chit chatting and texting and making the coffees wrong Cashier at the drive thru window literally handed me my receipt with her head down and other hand texting Very irritated that I paid for two coffees and it wasnt until I reached my next destination that I realized that they were made completely wrong Ladies making the coffee were talking and laughing and didnt say hello or thank you Very rude
18246,1,Got the buttermilk chicken sandwich and not even sure if there was chicken Bit untonit and had a cold grey semi solid mass caked in flavorless breading Fries were soggy and unappealing Usually no matter what Mcds you go to you expect some consistancy with this one in Roanoke you can expect consistent bad food Stay clear of this place Staff definitely doesnt care and to say the food is subpar would be a compliment
1516,1,Terrible
18259,1,This place is the worst  It smelled like manure  I had to go to the counter like 3 times before the order was complete Cold fries and burnt apple pies I didnt like this olace at all  Next birthday for my grandson will be somewhere else
20632,1,Didnt visit
32385,1,Do NOT go to this McDonalds if youre in a hurry We were just picking up a drink so it wasnt a problem but ordering was chaos and there was a guy beside us who had seriously been waiting 35 min for his chicken sandwich He showed us the receipt showing when he ordered and was trying to ask the staff what was happening and they were quite rude and just said man you can see we busy Also note that this was the only McDonalds we encountered in Florida that doesnt offer 1 any size soft drinks
18264,1,Very disappointed with this McDonalds I ordered a crispy buttermilk chicken sandwich meal and supersize my order when I drove uo to the window I paid my total and then I sat there waiting for about 5 minutes so I said to myself maybe theyre cooking a fresh chicken so I didnt mind the wait Well when I got home I took the first bite on the sandwich and let me tell you THAT CHICKEN HAD BEEN SEATING ON THE HEAT PAN FOR A VERY LONG TIME BECAUSE IT WAS LITERALLY HARD LIKE A ROCK AND IT WAS NOT JUICY AT ALL IT WAS VERY DRY and then the fries that I got were overcooked every single one of them were burnt
20621,1,The food is hard and nasty
18281,1,Ive never had a good experience with any McDonalds Ive ever been to so I usually avoid McD if possible  My only visit to this McDonalds in Roanoke messed up my order  I had ordered 2 hamburgers with no mustard fries and drink  I get home only to discover that the hamburgers did not have ketchup and onions but were instead covered in mustard  Wont be back
32397,1,I live 150 feet away and waited an hour to place an order This is supposed to be fast food Never had a more disappointed experience with McDonald
18280,1,Whats with the weak coffee The McDonalds coffee usually has a great flavor this morning its like dirty warm water weak and diluted During breakfast lunch unacceptable
18279,1,Took my 3 year old here to eat and play in the play place There was a homeless man sitting in there with his no socks or shoes on Multiple employees walked by him without saying anything
32396,1,They have the worst manger ever One of them have a lack of speaking which is Arlene Ledesma She doesnt know what is being said to her You cant get your point across because she wont understand  Cant handle the  customers and shes very disrespectful
18278,1,Ew omg the coke is so disgusting it does not taste like coke it taste so disgusting and they take their time like i dont have a 30 minute lunch 
32400,1,For the third time in the morning this is happened to me the drivethrough lady does not answer I drove around the front this morning and they had about four employees there looking at me  One of them gave me a thumbs up to go back to the drivethrough which I did and it was the same result the lady did not answer and finally I decided I would leave and right before I left she answered by saying one moment please so I waited hey moment and she still was not ready so I just left  There have been two vehicles in the drivethrough before me that had also left and I did not understand why until my experience I believe the employees are slacking off in the morning which is difficult for me because if I dont have breakfast then I have to wait 6 12 hours at work before they allow me to go eat 
32394,1,no stars this is the worst ever service i have ever encountered 28 minutes in the drivethru I asked for a refund and the managers name and they refunded me my money and decline to give me the food I ask the manager for her name and she walks away at the end i got my food for free but perhaps a better management team needs to come in and train cus these young women that were there yesterday 623 around 2pm were exchanging snapchat videos and chitchatting like they didnt have 810 cars in the drive thru
32392,1,Drive thru cashier completely got my order wrong  She order what she saw on register and not what I wanted  Then look surprised when I told her  The manager should not let her work drive thru Which explains why the line was so long  Im sure Im not the only order she screwed up Dont normally post these comments  but its becoming more of the norm these days
18271,1,This McDonalds screws up 96 of the time Tonight was the last straw My husband ordered 2 large fries 2 PLAIN McChickens and 2 large drinksThe drinks were greatthe rest was not even what he ordered and OLD In the bag was a fillet o fish which to my surprise was the only fresh thing 2 medium 5 year old fries and 2 10 year old cheeseburgersseriously the cheeseburgers were so old the cheese was crusting Where is the quality They dont care if people are upset andor get food poisoning Granted my husband should have checked the bag before leaving but he didnt think to not surprised I was definitely upset the order was wrong and said whatever and we were going to eat it because we basically got smaller fries but an extra sandwich but those CHEESEBURGERS were so horrendous that whoever put that order together should be fired because it was just wrongmeat and cheese was well past shelf life and the pics I upload will show it Way to go McDonalds for providing POOR SERVICE yet again
18270,1,I used to go to this McDonalds every morning for breakfast The customer service has gone to hell and they havent gotten my order correct in the drive thru for 8 days in a row No one speaks English well enough to complain they just look at you and smile
32390,1,"Staff are busy talking and they dont care about customers  And they make us wait for long time at drive through all the time
When I called at the store they picked up the call But when I start complain about this situations they hung up on my face  This McDonald used to be so good and professional
I dont know what happened
since they changed to new staff got worse "
32388,1,Terrible establishment Slow af Incredibly long lines Waited in line for 40 minutes Im the drive thru for them to tell me they aren
1491,1,Terrible
18265,1,This is the worst McDonalds Ive ever been to Ive tried it several times mostly because its on the way to my workbut after today honestly Id rather skip breakfast all together I got a completely soggy hash brown soggy all the way around I got a small caramel frappe with a shot of espresso They put the espresso on the bottom and just poured the Frappe on top so all I got was espresso when I first tried it To add insult to injury they put it in a small cup and dumped the rest out it should have been in a medium cup I worked at a McDonalds for over 2 years and this one does not follow procedures at all
32393,1,This McDonalds needs to close Ive ordered 15 times in 6 months and had 1 correct order Dont order delivery go yourself and check the bag before you leave
18198,1,Employees change but as of 073021 at 411pm they will put no meat on your burger and no salt on your fries and if you ask for any condiments they will ignore your request They seem like nice enough people but their service is terrible no refund or remake was requested Never ask for your food to be remade Don
32306,1,if i could give it 0 stars i could HORRIBLE SERVICE never give you what u paid for and when u ask for it they spit on your food
18197,1,The drive through service is horrible They gave me the wrong order and was told to wait I waited  for over 5 minutes for them The manager Maria Gutierrez might have her last name wrong FIRE HER After waiting for so long I had to drive through again only for her to lie and say she gave me my food Very rude individual Had lost all my appetite by the time I got the food

18170,1,I ordered a artisan chicken sandwich no tomatoes on 22219 through the drivethru and when I went to get my food they told me to pull up and wait I waited half a hour to get this sandwich and chicken nuggets The sandwich looks like it was thrown together way too much sauce It was all over the entire sandwich and on the inside of the box that made the bread soggy And to top it all off they gave me the head of lettuce and brown lettuce
32283,1,Ordered through rewards program   my order came incomplete  and cold  they refused to honor the reward deal  Go to Taco Beel cross street next time at least food will  be hot 
18169,1,Yesterday 232023 I stopped at Roanoke McDonalds to get breakfast  I ordered the Big Breakfast with pancakes via kiosk  My order was number 797 upon serving me my food I ask for an extra syrup  The employee gave me the syrup but was very rude in telling me it cost 35 cents and next time include it in my order  Without giving me a chance to explain he walked off   To add to the bad service I discovered after leaving my pancakes were cold  I dont usually go to this McDonalds and usually dont get bad service at McDonalds but figured Id take the time to let others know how this McDonalds is treating its customers
32280,1,They keep talking to me when I told them that I am deaf and they gesture that the app is not working as I thought I typed the orders then show them and I give them a card but they finally typed the phone said only cash They waste my 10 minutes time for nothing Poor service Nonfriendly disability
32279,1,I cant believe how many times they ask me if I wanted cheese on my double CHEESEburger I ask for it only ketchup n onions Im surprised they didnt ask me if I wanted the meat as well SMH
20694,1,Good
32293,1,Its supposed to be a 24 hour I come there 5am in the morning they talk about their  Close for cleaning And the guys That told me this through the intercom is in the lobby sleeping telling me through the drivethrough headset

18178,1,My hash brown had sooooo much grease that it soaked through the bag GROSS Ill never get food from this location again
18196,1,Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service is an understatement The manager screams at everyone who is a customer To me his young pond has no experience in customer service I have never been to a place had experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location this is very true I have gone through drive threw and walked in To see bad people working there just do not care I did send message to McDonalds Company hopefully someone will see what

32303,1,Service was terrible here Staff kept us waited for over 20 minutes while we could hear them chatting and laughing on the other side
18193,1,I have been in line for 10 minutes and how you have it set up you have one line you veer to the right of the intercom or to the left but you only have one lane going to those intercoms I had several people behind me this lady comes around and cuts me off I got out of my car I said excuse me you almost hit me and could have caused a catastrophic accident  She said that the lady told her to cut in front of me and I said who and the manager of that McDonalds Sylvia said I did I told her you almost caused a catastrophic accident and she said its a twolane and I said no maam and other people in line roll their windows down and said its only a one lane and Sylvia argued with all of us that were  in line  waiting Youre going to have a catastrophic accident there if you dont get two lanes drawn up Number two Sylvia should not be arguing with the customers in line and she did not serve us I never use profanity I told her it was unprofessional and that it could have caused an accident and other people were telling her the sameIm very disappointed how McDonalds has lowered the bar in hiring people that will argue with their customers when the  are trying to prevent an accident I thought the motto is safety first
18190,1,They need to get more training First they tell me I only paid for the sandwiches not the meal Paid 1154 Two sandwiches doesnt add up  to that Came back told the girl Im missing drink She told me to go back around and reorder  I go back in line and get my drinks  I get home my whole order is wrong Just looking at through the food there were eggshels in the eggs Just terrible
18189,1,"McDonalds in Roanoke has been a disappointment to me lately It seemed like a good idea to use them as a fast stop for breakfast on my way to work this past week Unfortunately I was let down by the service I received 
The first day I ordered In the drive through and the lady taking my order seemed like should could not understand me so when I got to the first window and paid I asked for a receipt the ladys response was We dont have receipts When I got to the second window and received my food it was comandwich than what I had ordered 
I decided to try them again one last time the third morning in a row and the service in the drive through was rather rude just like the first time and I received the wrong size coffee AGAIN When I asked the man about it his response was I don"
32277,1,We spent more than half an hour in the drive through One person is doing all the work The ice cream machine is not working as well as the milk shake 
18188,1,Incorrect order and couldnt mix Powerade and sprite for some reason
18186,1,Absolutely TERRIBLE customer service Never in my years of walking this planet have I ever experienced such a terribly trained and terribly managed location Charging me almost 30 for an order of pancakes and giving ME and attitude when it is THEIR mistake I very calmly stated that there was an obvious mistake on the receipt the cashier seemed new but for some reason the manager thought it was appropriate to put the blame on ME and not their lack of being a good manager and training their employees properly Disgusting behavior for a problem that required next to NO effort to fix but the manager sought it better worth their time and effort to be nasty
18185,1,It use to be good but they got new owners and it like they are cutting corners to save money Also the manager  just looks at you and not take your order

18179,1,Manager on duty was very rude  My husband went today to pick up a missing item from order from the previous night that they forgot to give us  Instead of going above and beyond to correct their mistake and guarantee excellent customer service she proceed to interrogate my husband rudely  In todays world where there are so many options to eat you think that people would put their best foot forward to make sure their customers have a good experience I WILL NEVER spend my hard earned money at that location EVER AGAIN

What a horrific experience I just had  this lady you see in the picture for telling her she was giving me a wrong item and not the one I paid for she started a big drama and spilt my sons smoothie and started singing a vulgar songlyrics as per offending me through that and not directly addressed to me All that in front of the manager 

Besides that waiting time was ridiculous long with a lot of customers not satisfied and even a uber eats guy had to cancel in front of  me because they didnt make his order in more than 20 min that I was there 

Another lady in the back was not using the yellow paper that sandwiches have she was placing the  bunsbread directly on the table as she was preparing food for dogs She saw me and start acting like nothing happened

This place is a completely mess

JUST STAY AWAY"

31246,1,"Went today after the zoo it was a very bad experience to say the least
We were given over seasoned  fries one straw for three drinks and the drinks were all bad
I thought how do you mess up a drink
It is my belief that this was attributed to the mistake that was made with coffee order wanted moca frap was given hot coffee
She took all drinks back and brought tray back with correction
It tasted like instead of coffee mixture it was blended with old filtered out deposits I mean really sour
The manager however corrected the moca and recooked fries
When we left a second time I tasted the unsweetened tea and Coke It was horrible foul I thought omg I almost served this to my kids
Will not ever return"

31263,1,Dirty Dirty Dirty We saw previous customers coming back to get their orders fixed Every table in the play place was awful Ours had spilled milk The employee took one trash can out but didnt pick up the trays and didnt clean up the busted bbq sauce on the floor What was also bad was that we moved to another table and the floor was covered with napk
31262,1,"Be careful with young children here We had a women approach our booth and asked personal questions about my young niece while my brother was getting the food We tried to dismiss her and did not answer her questions but she just sat herself in our booth uninvited We asked her to leave several times because it was very uncomfortable She just continued to sit and stare at my neice We made it clear we were having a private lunch and would like her to leave
Then the womens boyfriend called her back to his table she left us and then they walked out shortly after
Another patron approached us after the women left our table because she believed the women was planning to abduct my niece She noticed the women staring at my niece and told us to be safe When we left they were parked next to our truck as well We will definitely not be going back there"

17534,1,Fast food will kill you

21296,1,Deceptive pricing FTC Violation  Menu says add drink to the bundle for 100 but they charged 169 manager would not honor menu price in violation of Federal law Bathrooms out of order They were making people order on the kiosk only and calling out the table numbers instead of delivering the food to tables
2186,1,McDonalds service and good taste are declining rapidly and they do not care And they do not care All they care about is collecting the cash
21297,1,Employees are rude nothing was made after I placed my order online 30 minutes before went through the drive thru and they didnt even know how to process the order through the app
21299,1,Since its on the strip prices are more expensive for example the 1 drink is like 189 they are multiple McDonalds within 2 miles that have regular pricing Some of the staff seems to not have all of it down pact had to wait several minutes for them to correctly enter no onions no pickles on the sandwhich

21358,1,Cant get a refill because of Covid  All you have to do is use a new cup  I think at a 179 per drink one cup wont cut into the profit margin that much  But I wouldnt want to send McDonalds into bankruptcy  Quit being cheap and hiding behind Covid for an excuse
2254,1,Food no fresh The burger seems like made long time ago 
2253,1,All of those workers got an attitude They act like billionaires
21353,1,They no respect the prices for example the breakfast promotion 2 sauce McMuffin for 450 they want pay 845

17297,1,Be careful the cashier tried to charge extra and didnt fill in the full order  Had missing things On top the cashier got upset for asking for missingthings  The
17296,1,The McDonalds on Haddonfield Berlin Road in Voorhees is the worst place ever to get food Ive ordered from there and they charge my credit card almost 40 and only gave me half my order and never gave me my receipt so I have no way to get the food or get the money back So I would advise people to take as much time as you need in the DriveThru to make sure you have all your food that you actually ordered
17295,1,There was hair in my food so i took it back and when i told the manager she said to me  theres no possible way there could be hair in our food I laughed and said well i dont see a hairnet on your head and she started yelling and arguing with me about giving me my money back She finally gave it back after arguing the point with me while i had a whole line behind me Ignorant and you do not treat customers like that Period Why would i lie about hair being in my food anyway We were traveling i did not want to turn around Haha what a joke Thank god i never have to go there again I dont live anywhere near there
17294,1,"This location is ok When I was there last week was told to go to first window to pay No one was there waited a few and no one came so I pulled up to the next window   Payment was to be made at the first window Then they get my order wrong I was missing a drink and given an extra fri So I had one person with no drink and Fris that no one wanted When I told the girl I was missing a drink she just stared at me like I was speaking another language I left unhappy

17313,1,Nasty foul odor of chinese food overtook the place upon entering and in entire lobby Employees mustve had massive chinese take out order leading to the offensive odor I lost my appetite and will avoid this location like corona virus
17312,1,Had the longest wait of my life for some cheap food Not only was the wait long for everyone but whoever was working that day gave zero Fs because they kept giving me the wrong order and just told me to move up and then proceed to hand me a bag that they already handed to someone else that I saw digging thru it Mind you fries are all over the place and Im happy to enjoy a meal thats been on someone else
17311,1,Your company is advertising support for front line workers but your company is very disrespectful to people who are helping others I was rushing from one state to another state to help disable children stopped for breakfast at this location I was told to wait so the person in drive thru could take another persons order who came after me The person never came back on to help me even after me steady saying hello and waiting I was about to be late for work so I left and went to dunkin donutsYou guys should NEVER advertise free meals for front line workers when its clearly a lie There is no support

2472,1,All they give you are melting ice cream
17307,1,This is the most unprofessional McDonalds I have EVER ordered from I ordered using uber eats and when my food arrived it was packaged with stickers stuck all around the bag where as I could barely open the bag There is a gaping hole in the bag and this is not even to mention the poor quality of the food Half of the food was cold my hashbrown was crushed and bent and my sandwich was poorly packaged No care went into the process of my order I do not recommend anyone to purchase anything as little as a water bottle from this establishment I am sick to my stomach at the fashion my food was given to me in NEVER AGAIN
2475,1,Extremely long lines Order is never right
17306,1,They messed up a simple order like a four piece Chicken Mcnugget and a beverage The young lady taking the order misunderstood me when I be asked for a Orange drink and charged for a Orange juice So when I went to the window I thought the order was confirmed and corrected and the price was lowered but to no avail when I received my beverage it was a Orange soda I wet around the drive through again spoke to the manager and she apologized Last visit to this McDonalds
2477,1,My mom loves the coffee
31634,1,Horrible customer service Never going to this location again
17304,1,Seriously 9 out 10 times they tend to forget at least one thing I go there cause its a driving convenience but honestly  Id rather drive the extra 15 minutes knowing that I wouldnt have to turn back once I get my order The kids that work there are nice the manager Jesus bit of an attitude
2480,1,20 minutes for a mcflurry  soda  Ignored when asked about it
17308,1,"Hi

31578,1,They are lazy and rude and in my opinion racist only happier to serve their race
31577,1,Know someone there named Kyrin he called me a bot then messed up my order
17256,1,Very cold hash brown Egg mcmuffin not so great either
2541,1,incompetent employees
21486,1,Waited 30 minutes to get food spending about 7000 and not a friendly manager
17254,1,Being a pregnant female the experience I had with working there just recently was very terrible I was treated very poorly by my managers and coworkers I had only one break my entire shift which means I could only eat one time and my manager daisy made me take a break in the mornings which wasnt right to eat early and then go hungry till I got off Daisy was a very rude manager gave me a hard time on my 3 rd day I told them this was my first time working there never dont a job like this as a manager she shouldve been more patient and had some respect She even talked about me to her friends but would speak in her language so I wouldnt understand Karen was another manager that was never the was training me and was pretty rude as well Rachel was another I would like to sue for discrimination against my pregnancy and harsh treatment during my time working there I felt very uncomfortable The Hispanic females that work there are like the ones in charge they even take mini breaks but I only had one my whole shift pregnant female standing in one spot for the whole day the only person that was nice was Kimberly  I will be sueing this company and I should press charges against nicki Nelson
31574,1,Extremely rude service and super slow The place was dirty also
2545,1,Workers are barking too baddddddddddddd
17253,1,Slowest McDonalds Ive ever been to and screwed up my entire order Also waited 15 minutes and food was cold Will never go back Simple job yet these people are incapable
17252,1,I got what I ordered wich was an ice coffe and one sausage burrito There was no line how ever the attendant was not attentive causing my Check out time to be close to ten minutes for a very simple order I have to change my rating to one star shortly after eating my burrito I got very sick to my stomach
17250,1,Whatever you do do NOT go to this McDonalds location Theres a reason why I rated it one star and I can kindly explain why While the food there is good I simply cannot stare at these people the same way anymore A hour or two ago I showed up to get some food and there was this one woman working behind the register I dont remember her name but I assume she was a manager or something She was in a blue shirt and glasses and thats all I can remember There was an annoying beeping sound that seemed concerning and I politely asked key word here is politely them to investigate it and make it stop They didnt bother to check it which shows that theyre neglectful of the resources around their workplace The reaction I got from this woman was 100 disrespectful and told me to get out of her store and never come back and even tried to call 911 on me Its pretty obvious that I caught this woman on a bad day Clearly I was furious because I felt like she was deliberately trying to get under my skin and using that to her advantage You know what they call people like her A bully I was bullied by the manager because I had a concern that needed to be addressed I was not trying to show up on this woman at any point during my visit I was trying to be as lenient as I possibly could If the woman I was referring to was actually a manager of this establishment she needs to be put in her place because thats NOT how a manager should treat her customers I do not like being antagonized especially by an employee and it really showed during this visit Come to think about it Ive been checking on other reviews of this location they all had numerous problems with this particular person Obviously Im heartbroken because now I dont have anywhere to go to eat after my work shift Im only relegated to the ChickFilA a minute down the road and even I know they have better hearts and respect than this woman did and their food is also good As a man diagnosed with autism I strongly advise people to stay away from this location at all costs If you really need to go to a McDonalds steer clear of this location Its not worth your time and its not worth your sanity Also their drink machine has been broken and flat for at least a few months and they didnt fix that either I will be contacting corporate about the antics going afoot at this location
17249,1,"The absolute worst McDonalds Ive ever dealt with The most incompetent management Ive ever experienced
First 2 out of my last 3 breakfast orders were wrong But didnt realize until I got to work I cannot leave my job to go back
Then today I got a steak egg and cheese bagel Which was right with the exception of 2 long black hairs in it
I stopped back on my way home and asked for a manager
The first manager only asked for a receipt She then left and got another manager She was a heavy set black woman She was the most ignorant vile person that Ive ever dealt with Not even an apology Her response was to bring it back 5 hours later When I said that was ridiculous she closed the window and walked away I asked for a corporate phone number and she refused
I called and I can only assume it was the same ignorant woman because she put the phone down and left it off the hook
I called again for the phone number and she said its on my receipt and hung up
She is clearly incompetent and doesnt deserve her jib
Funny thing is I didnt ask for anything free An Im sorry may have been enough
But nothing even close I would never recommend this dump of a McDonalds nor the clearly racist manager
I will stop at nothing now to make sure she cant treat anyone like this again"
21487,1,worst ever customer service manager is so rude dont even apologize for the wrong order
17259,1,"Ordered a burger at the drivethrough I was made to wait for 20 minutes and when the food came I was given the wrong order I brought it inside to talk the employees so I could get the correct food I spoke with the manager and she was unbelievably rude Acted like it was my fault that my daughter was given the wrong burger I finally was given the right burger but I have no idea why the manager made it such an awful experience
To top it off I walked into the bathroom There was someone sitting in the stall He flushed and walked out He was an employee and he didnt wash his hands Just walked out of the bathroom and when I came out he was making burgers Disgusting"
31587,1,Horrible service the wait was excruciatingly long and the workers were very unprofessional
31588,1,Bad food and service the soda is flat and good is horrible and Ive never met such ghetto personel
17261,1,This McDonalds on Blackwood Clementon Rd is very unprofessional and I wont be going back there The staff are clueless about their job and they are rude
31604,1,The only mcdonalds not serving breakfast all day yall trash
17287,1,Since the kiosk was introduced into the restaurants the staff does not even acknowledge your presence Plus they are overstaffed There are so many servers bringing food to the tables that they bump into each other and customers constantly And the overcrowded staff in the back looks like pure chaos I went to the register to place my order cause I prefer to talk to a human being and the counter person told me to go use the kiosk Im busy There is no organization and order just chaos and confusion With all the extra staff and the introduction of the kiosks service is even slower than before and they still get it wrong
21472,1,Worst McDonalds I
17284,1,I ordered Mcnuggets They were okay At least I thought But by the time I arrived home my stomach was bubbling Had to move like lightening to get to the bathroom Barely made it I will never order from or eat there again
17283,1,The order clerk and her Manager Nikki refused to give me a glass for water accusing that I might steal soda  Should I stop giving McDonalds 20 daily business and another 100 for my team because of Nikkis horrible accusatory stance  The main manager should be fired for not training customer unfriendly Nikki
21474,1,Terrible Waited for 32 minutes and compared to others that was short Food was cold and staff seemed nonchalant about everything
21479,1,Worst Mcdonalds ever The homeless will attack you and the security will just stand there  stay in the casino if u want Mcdonalds not worth it
17288,1,Absolutely horrible place They have people working the drivethru speaker who can barely speak English get the order wrong and are not polite  When I have ordered here they mess up the order almost every time  I wonder if there is a manager here because the employees seem more intent on fooling around and laughing than paying attention to their customers  They need to get things straightened out and realize that if they dont provide better service they will go out of business  I will not return to this one and go to the McDonalds on Route 70 instead
17274,1,this location regularly overcharges in  a two week period members of this household were charged 425 for large fries and 9 for a filet o fish meal this is not the first time this location has done this but it will be the last time
2522,1,Always check ur bag
17267,1,Tried to order something at the drive thru around 11pm and was given zero response during the 20 minutes that I waited According to what it says online the place was suppose to be open til 12am and yet I couldnt get a order in around 11pm I sometimes wonder if the owner knows that they been closing up earlier than usual
17266,1,I was waiting at 1055pm and the lady said wait to me and then after 7 minutes she said I cant take your order I explained my self I said  was waiting 5 minutes for you and she said it doesnt matter me Very disrespectfull gi

I asked for a macchiato  Got a large cup of sugar and cream WITH A SQUIRT OF ESPRESSO I wanted macchiato not a cup of creamer and sugar I asked for more espresso to be added and got attitude about it and was told they would have to charge me more next time FOR THE ESPRESSO They clearly do not realize what an macchiato is It has espresso in it and not just a 7th of cup of espresso Manager was not helpful Said thats the way its made I said no its not Ive been to many other McDonalds and this isnt how they make it I also have had this at a lot of other coffee places and that what they gave me wasnt a macchiato He said I work at 3 other McDonalds no its not So I told him which one I like to go to that makes it right So then he proceeds to say well that is how our machine makes it Didnt want to help Just argue and get rid of me I didnt appreciate being treated like I was and that I would be charged for wanting espresso in my drink that is supposed to have espresso
Could tell they were not having a good night and dint seem to care to make things right and wanted  to just get rid of meSo I took my stuff and  left"

31660,1,Gave me wrong food
17331,1,I went to McDonalds for lunch with my 2 little kids and Laurie took my order One of the items I ordered was 2 cheeseburgers with NO MUSTARD  She missed the request for NO MUSTARD but I noticed the omission when she handed me my receipt When I told her that I ordered my cheeseburgers with NO MUSTARD her reply was No you didnt  After that customer service blunder she agreed to tell the person preparing my cheeseburgers not to put mustard on them  Once we got our food I had the unique experience of listening to her berate her cooking staff because they werent going fast enough for the next 20 minutes while me and my 2 kids were trying to enjoy our meal I will find another McDonalds to go to next time
31653,1,No straw no napkins and my frys were old

17326,1,"We went there tonight to get food for our family The order was all messed up and the buns on all the sandwiches were hard as rocks
Very disappointed in McDonalds I really like McDonalds but it looks like Im going to have to start going to Burger King again "
2453,1,VERY VERY BAD SERVICE ON DRIVE THRU
17321,1,Too much salt was dying of thurst after
31645,1,Sat in drive through no one answered watched 8 cars go to window in 30 minutes saw no activity from the chain very depressing
21455,1,I order 3 20 pieces receive 30 unacceptable  thats not how you do business dont like it
17317,1,Ok here goes I stopped into the location on Rt73 in west Berlin NJ  for lunch today The drive through line was super long so I parked and went I side I ordered a number 5 artisan chicken sandwich meal I paid waited like 15 minutes they called my number and I brought my ticket to the counter and took my bag I got to work and found out I didnt get a chicken sandwich but instead I got a big mac Which normally wouldnt be an issue but I hate big macs Ive gotten sick eating one before and ever since I cant even look at a big mac without getting sick to my stomach Needless to say I wasnt happy I threw the bag in my car and went on with the rest of my work day on the way home I stopped back in and brought the bag of food back to McDonalds The manager named Rebecca came to the counter and I told her what happened and I showed her all of the food I got and explained to her what I was supposed to getkeep in mind I didnt even touch a fry She was super rude to me and said she cant do anything because I didnt save my receipt I dont know about anyone else but I always hand my ticket in when they call my number to prove that its my food theyre handing out And I asked her whats the difference between a receipt and the untouched food that I brought back I asked for a refund because I was no longer hungry she said no I asked for a new meal after 5 minutes of her spouting off why she couldnt make it right she finally gave in and walked away from me huffing and puffing and yelled to the back make an artisan chicken sandwich so a couple minutes later someone put a bag with just the sandwich in it on the counter and I asked where the fries were and she said there was nothing wrong with the fries earlier just the sandwich so this miserable poop butt of a manager refused to give me fresh French fries with my sandwich and handed me back the old fries from 6 hours ago She took this whole interaction so personal and was acting like the money was coming out of her pocket My final argument was asking her if she thought I was lying and did she think I made the big mac and fries at my house and brought it in to pull one over on her What a horrible experience It sucks when you get 30 minutes for lunch and youre starving and wind up not being able to eat and its someone elses fault You want someone to make it right Instead this manager who gets to use her little bit of power to make up her own rules and make it difficult for you Like it would of ruined her entire life to fix their error and make it right It just sucked Ill NEVER go back there just because of her And I hope no one else will either Thats how pissed if this whole mess made me
17316,1,"I went to the McDs on Rt 561 at Roughly 2145hrs to get a 14 pounder meal with a milkshake During the ordering a woman loudly voiced acrossed the floor to the young lady assisting me that she is NOT to take ANY ice cream orders after 2130
The employee was as stunned as I and ask why and in an Arrogant voice She said its because we GOTZ  gotz to clean the machine Well I felt this was rude and followed up with a question to this woman I asked  what if I get here at 2145 and ask for a milkshake She again in an Arrogant voice responded with  you aintz getting it  aintz  The rest of the staff laughed when she made this comment
After all this and being made to wait 15 minutes for my order I requested a refund and to speak to the manager I was told by this woman that no manager was available
So I went back the next day to report this incident I ask the front customer representative to speak with a manager Oddly enough she directed my attention to the woman that I had this encounter with the night before
So not only did I get HORRIBLE customer service in a language and tone that was less than professional I was lied to as the customer service repAKA Manager Nicky was available the whole time
If Nicky is the Manager and is leading that team it wont be long until that location starts losing customers as they just loss 1

I would go elsewhere to eat"
2459,1,Always has disgusting smelly homeless people lying around
31649,1,Why have to drive threws if ones closed and you have a line thats super long
17245,1,How incompetent can you be when you have all this staff standing there and no one willing to help the customer why does a manager have to tell their employees to help a customer You see a customer you help them  On top of that a lady that put her order in the kiosk after I had given mine  was given her order first We literally ordered almost the same things and she was helped before 
2439,1,Unprofessional worker And take too long to make food
17334,1,"This was the worst experiencehas very youngchildishand incompetent people working here messed up our simple order 3 timesovercharged  megiven no refundbut given attitudes galorewhybecause mgrwas busy dealing with another angry customerbehind mesaid too busy to refund deal with me when askeddue to thatwthIm Calling corpfor my refund Treated poorly barely apologizedterrible custservand fries were coldburgers bland no condiments given either

2422,1,Staff is extremely rude and disrespectful
17333,1,A group of friends 6 of us total were kicked out shortly after eating due to the store managers orders Their rule is 5 kids in the restaurant at a time because of an incident that happend a week ago where kids made a mess and broke a salt shaker Two out of the group left and it was us 4 sitting there having casual conversation in the side of the restaurant and a second lady came up to us and asked us to leave again because football kids are coming in and that there were too many kids at one time Keep in mind we were not disrespectful or disruptive McDonalds was just a place to eat not hang out or lounge in our free time Nearing adulthood I felt very offended and quite frankly disrespected by store management AND their employees Oh I also waited 10 minutes for my 20 piece nugget and medium fries
21439,1,Total rip off None of the McD discounted items like 1 coffee or coupons are honored here
21441,1,Its McDonalds so expect slow service complete with incorrect orders I personally dont go to this McDonalds because of it
31671,1,Perfect exit and perfect entrance on SI35 but service is horrible and slowdont waist 1hour in line
17350,1,This place is a disaster waiting to happen the fish filet was drenched Im talking soaking in tartar sauce not sure whos poop list I was on but it was deffinately intentional and unnecessary and more so obvious not to mention we waited for about 30min just to place an order the people smile so 1 star for effort Mainly because you have no clue what your about deal with if you assume everythings ok smh avoid this place at all cost Word to the wise 
17346,1,The young lady working on Monday January 27th at 9pm at the register gave me back wrong change She then became hostile and took very long to get the manager We then left because we had enough Learn to count back change and go back to math class
17344,1,Just left this location during a very slow time cashier had absolutely no patience not helpful when I tried to use the app had a terrible attitude didnt even wait for me to finish ordering before she started taking the next order beh

19246,1,Im so wrong to give even one star But I have any option to give less  Today is 3182019 At around 9 pm I went to pick up the delivery from this place from drive thru  Because it was close upon the governor order and I was in urgent situation to use the bathroom but unfortunately no one of the people working there has any kind of human beings They refused to allow to 
33139,1,Ok
19244,1,Absolutely horrible Not sure who the owner is but they should definitely get a new staff and get Mcdonalds corporate to come in for training The service is bad and so is the food They give you what they want not what you pay for especially as it gets closer to closing time Food should be available and fresh no matter how close it is to closing Workers should understand that if they dont wanna work let somebody who wants to do the job Not suprised at the amount of negative reviews but I am suprised that ownership and management does not take these reviews into consideration Complete disgrace Go a little further in bellevi
33138,1,Yuck
33137,1,Super slow
19243,1,Their food taste like plastic Very unsatisfied with them They used to be good But now its like they dont care if the food is fresh or not
19679,1,Bad service
19241,1,Arguably one of the most incompetent branches of McDonalds that Ive ever had the displeasure of going to I spent 20 minutes waiting on a mobile order when I could have easily gone through the drivethru and gotten it in 5 Absolutely ridiculous
19240,1,For the third day I went to this McDonalds which I frequently always come to this McDonalds my daughter and my niece love McDonalds so each time I place my order I ask for a medium fries  with my additional order and for the three days that I went they were given me burnt fries  Im sorry but I paid a lot for my order to begin with Im not excepting burnt fries especially three days in a row Each time I asked for some new fries and then they would give me good fries that were not burnt Except for yesterday I got my money back  I ask the girl why was she giving me burnt fries and her reply was that they didnt change the oil in which they cooked the fries in The point is as a customer you dont have to keep excepting burnt fries or anything that doesnt look right to you You are already spending so much money to begin with to be getting burnt fries Lately theres been lots of issues with this McDonalds people have attitudes dont have manners they dont even say hi  or thank you for coming Ill be taking my service elsewhere No customer service
19239,1,Literally the worst McDonalds ever  Food always cold  Staff is all illegal and no help from them about asking about promotions always busy both inside and drive thru have plenty of workers but somehow always a long wait  Rude workers even if you call asking about promotions they always hang up  Even with all that said they still have the same stingy services with uber eats  Cold half cooked food go somewhere else save your money
19237,1,Welcome to the worst McDonald in north Newark I ordered a Big Mac meal and 10 PCs nuggets meal with both sprite I received 10 PCs nuggets 1 order of French fries 4 triple cheeseburgers without onions pickles mustard and unsweetened tea

19199,1,McDonalds is the worst food you can feed to your kids and for yourself the burger  bun so hard it Crack your teeth by the time you get to your car the food is cold  and McDonalds has the same menu from the 80s and 90s you better off cooking at home and with this inflation nobody has money 
19198,1,This place is not good at all the manager Had an attitude when I went with my mom and a few friends we ordered our milkshakes and fries and when my moms friend asked for barbecue sauce and ketchup she realized that she wanted ketchup and buffalo sauce so she asked the manager and the manager said and I quote  Which one is it Then my moms friend looked up and said buffalo and ketchup I guess
19197,1,OMG  Last time I order 3 double cheeseburger  they look like they were sitting there for hours So this time I ask the girl that I want my burgers fresh so they come up with the brilliant idea of putting the burgers and the fries in the microwave so they would be nice hot and fresh

Number of times theyve gotten the order right 0

It cannot be spelled out any clearer Quarter pounder Absolutely nothing on it No cheese Just the meat and the bun It is so simple Under normal circumstances I would stick around for them to get it right But they have a steady supply of drugged out homeless people begging for money right there in the drive through line so running that gauntlet a second time is downright dangerous

So I get home to see if i can salvage this order Pull the bun all the way off to start scraping fake cheese off of it The stale burned bun breaks picture I successfully scrape the cheese product off the top only to find theres another slice of fake cheese underneath the patty as well

I give up FightFor15 indeed"
19184,1,As a frequent customer of this McDonalds I am furious that you have your workers working under a heat wave with no type of air conditioning I walked in to order with my kids and had to take my order to the car and eat in car which was very uncomfortable with 4 kids bet way better than eating in a place where it was difficult to breath If you treat your employees like this than this is the reason your customer service in this locate is poor As a franchise you shouldnt be involved in this type of business never the less in any type of customer service business I will not be returning to this location as my money is worth more to other busine

33354,1,Very poor service from all employees
111,1,They tried to charge me for a piece of egg when I asked for a bacon egg and cheese McGriddle through the drive thru I went inside and the manager tried to charge me when her employee never confirmed my order All I said was sub bacon instead of the sausage and somehow the egg got taken off I don
19474,1,Nasty customer service drive thru window
109,1,"I didnt used to mind this McDs  I was happy there was an option for 24hr food in case I wanted something on the way home from a night out with friends or just latenight munchies  During the day its a pretty average McDs  But they lost my business forever when I went by one night at 1am pulled up to the order box waited for five minutes then finally someone came over the speaker and said Sorry were closed

Closed  Its 24hrs  And I get it sometimes 24hr places will close one night every several months to do a deep cleaning  I get that I really do  But they ALWAYS post signs and notices so youre not blindsided by it  Not this place  I really dont think they were closed  I think the workers were too lazy to do their job and decided to shut the store down so they could get paid to do nothing

Additionally this store has a bad habit of having a broken ice cream machine past 10pm  Its always sorry ice cream machine is broken if you come in after the lobby closes

The worst part is I complained on the website  I submitted a complaint for this store pointing out the 24hr and the ice cream issue  All I got back weeks later was oh sorry the ice cream machine was broken were working to upgrade all our locations but it takes time  Not even a single MENTION of the closed 24hr location

As I said its a pretty standard McDs which is synonymous with lazy but this one takes the cake on it"
92,1,Worst experience All I asked for was a regular size coffeeI get to the window and was handed a small  I asked the woman if that was a regular to which she rudely said yes I questioned her again two more times then I asked her how many sizes of coffee they had she said small medium and large I asked her which one was the one I was holding and she said its a small thats what we charged you for she said and I told her I asked for a regular which would be a medium but I just drove off Also asked for 3 splendas and 4 creamers on the side and received 3 regular sugars and 2 creamers To top it off coffee was full of coffee grounds to the point I was spitting them out And as a little plus there was a piece of plastic Never again
93,1,Attempted to go through the drive thru at 430 am It said it was 24 hour however no one seemed to be taking orders and I drove around twice just in case and tried again but still no answer I saw one employee in the kitchen but couldnt get his attention   Very bad business If closed or delayed in opening then at least a sign that indicates that would have been nice
19581,1,Always with an attitude and take forever
95,1,"My burger was completely raw in the middle and when I took the burger back in to get it remade the lady behind the counter treated me like I was some stuck up brat for not wanting to eat a raw burger
If I had the ability to give them a zero star rating I would I WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN"
96,1,"If I could give negative stars I would This location is the absolute worst ever  Every single time I go they f up my order Then give attitude when they need to correct their mistakes  I Try to give the benefit of the doubt everyone has offbad days so I return thinking this time will be different but it never is They always suck The staff is horrible Corporate needs to send all their staff over to a week of training at chicfilA college to learn about work ethic time management teamwork and basic manors
I am baffled how chicfila can have 30 cars in drive thru and get my order right the first time and under 5 mins But at McDonalds there could be 3 cars and it still takes 30 mins and 3 tries to get my order right makes no logical sense
Moral of rant save your time and money and drive around the corner to chicfila they got your"
97,1,When ordering food the employees conveniently forgot to turn off their microphones and were talking mess about all the food we had ordered this is very unprofessional and honestly uncalled for When I asked for a receipt they said it was in the bad and it was convenient not in there Ive trying to get ahold of management to speak ab
98,1,I dont usually review places but this location has ridiculously rude service and consistently gets the orders wrong Even when not busy If I were rude I

103,1,"Horrible customer service always gets my order wrong They were out of French fries so I said thats fine I can wait while you make more We cant do that seriously what kind of fast food place cant make fries It only takes two minutes and 15 to heat up even the worst fryer Which I would have waited for Is this not the money making industry

My business is now sitting at Whataburger who also doesnt have fries ready but said I could have some fresh in two minutes"
104,1,The most horrible service yet  Drive thru cant get a dam thing right at all has no interest in his voice I have to continue to repeat myself for you to still get it wrong Then when I went through drive threw they still cant follow directions So sad

107,1,Your general fast food place with subpar service Went here one morning to get a quick breakfast because we had no time for our usual Saturday morning spot We ordered several different breakfast items and at the end my wife went to order a single order of three pancakes and sausage breakfast for one of the kids At checkout it seemed expensive at first the cashier never repeated the order back to us When we received our order we figured out why She put us down for three total three pancakes and sausage breakfasts When my wife brought it up the girl behind the register just said oops sorry and walked away no offer to fix it or give a refund Great job
108,1,Lets just say this place would be a lot better if they had a different crew member There is a orange red hair lady names Veronica who does the window mostly and she ALWAYS has a attitude If you dont want to work at McDonalds then gone because their are people who take customer service 
19583,1,Not sure which location so cannot rate
91,1,This is the 3rd time in a row that weve been burned going through the drive threw Each time they have messed up our order and youd think by now that I would have learned my lesson but I thought this would be quick and easy NOPE This location sucks I tried calling the number in the receipt but no one answers I know I can

19550,1,Bad service
22,1,Meh just meh When I finally get the correct order it is generally tasty Im a picky eater and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items I like Worked in the service industry for years as a server bartender and trainer Taking and fulfilling orders is NOT hard tedious at times though I only go here when I see they are not busy in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct Just ONE not an exaggeration That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag they were hardly what youd call filled nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonalds on Facebook at least the few were hot The evening staff is very pleasant but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which being a light skinned Puerto Rican I understand perfectly I have submitted several complaints and NEVER received a call or email back I just dont go here anymore to avoid the stress of paying money for something that is most likely wrong

33274,1,They are very arrogant I took a coupon and they gave me three options I took the cheapest one and they sold me the most expensive one so why offer me and they spoke fast in English so I couldnt understand them and they could make fun of me

32725,1,It is the slowest fast food service ever
20345,1,I stop here often only because it is on my way to and from work but seriously this is by far consistently the worst McDonalds I have ever visited  The milk shake machine is always broke down as was tne case today  I ordered a big mack hold the catchup fries and a diet coke I even repeated myself to hold the catsup twice at the microphone and asked at the window again to insure she understood to hold the catsup on the burger and was meet with a very curt yes I heard you Guess what  not only did they not hold the catsup but it was over loaded with extra catsup and I got a regular coke  Well at least the fries were right  I honestly believe the main problem is that the people taking orders at the drive thru speak poor English and obviously understand it equally as poorly toped off with very poor customer service skills  They s eriously act like the customers are a bother
18623,1,Nasty place
20346,1,I dont eat breakfast without mac sauce they have given me mac sauce with my breakfast before but now they wont so no breakfast for me Lost a sale because their to lazy to open up some mac sauce just wows me
20347,1,After waiting five minutes in a drive through line the vehicle at the ordering microphone had to jump the curb to exit the line because the drive through lane was blocked by another car at the pickup window When I pulled up to the order microphone I was greeted with pleas wait a second I replied ive been reading the newspaper for the past five minutes and you are telling me to wait a second He said the computers were down and that they were accepting cash only If they had any integrity for customer service they would have come out and told us that five minutes ago I also had to jump the curb to leave the line When I did I was met with yelling from a person in the parking lot
1021,1,Long wait times for the drivethru They jerk you around with their openclose times too They close at eleven I drove by at 10 after ten and they said they were closed for the night
32722,1,Slow service food poorly made
20348,1,They used to have average customer service and take forever in the drive thru Now the customer service is also bad The lady at the drive thru can not get my order right for the life of her and is just rude I mean its convenient for me as its on my way to work but if you can avoid it do yourself a favor

20343,1,Its a shame that I have to rate Mcdonalds a 1 star but the service I received tonight was by far the worst I have experience and it needs to be addressed because now I will not be going back but the young lady that was working drive thru tonight her name is Elise was very rude and can not believe the way she talks to customers this is how exactly it went word for word and I work in customer service so I know how customers can be over the top when there complaining but word for word this is how it was I honked my horn as I was in drive thru after I received my food because I had asked for ranch sauce and was given buffalo keep in mind this is not a big deal for me and I will not be rude to the young lady over this but she took my honk as i did not have manners which is by far not my intentions I was simply trying to get her attention She opened the window and asked me with a attitude Did you just honk And started going off on me about manners by then i was so upset that i just told her just hand me my ranch i will not argue with you as she still was holding the ranch still going off I then told her are you kidding me just give me the ranch and explained to her since I pulled up to this window you have had a rude attitude but that was not my place to get upset over that if she was having a bad night I just wanted my order so I can get back to work as I addressed her attitude she then said to me Why cause Im black I was so beyond upset I have never been talk to this way from any restaurant and really do not know what this girls deal was and how did it lead to her assuming it was about her being black Will not be going back

918,1,You used to be able to get multiple Travis Scott special at a discount  Now the J Balvin Special is one per downloaded app to get the McFlurries for free  All other orders are at 12 dollars a pop u need to check ur order  Short on fries and the McFlurries were half filled  Totally disappointed

20295,1,Very UNPROFESSIONAL I ordered from my phone as I have the apps for any food place I asked my husband to go and pick up as I am working from home He arrived at this location and he went to give them the code and they said they could not fulfill my order since my phone was not at the restaurant Absolutely preposterous service My husband said they were very rude about the while thing I have never had this problem before as I have ordered several other times and never had to show them my phone I do not even see on the app where it says it is required to bring your phone 
931,1,My daughter and I went to get slushies but they couldnt make slushies or shakes cause their machines were down
20296,1,We just had the worst experience at this location We asked if they had the peppermint coffee for the holidays the woman responded with yeah I asked another question no response then she barks back hot or cold as I was asking my son what he wanted she once again barked hot or cold

18690,1,disapointed 
20277,1,Waited in drive thru for 23 minutes for 2 six piece nugget meals and fries There was only 1 car ahead of us and had to wait another 8 minutes just to order Looked like there was only 3 people working No apologies sorry thanks or any communication No gloves hair nets or concerns for those waiting as well as being short and rude at times Never going back there again
32777,1,Slowest drive thru I EVER EXPERIENCED Ridiculous Over a half hour REALLY

900,1,Worst mcdonalds around  Workers are rude and the orders are always wrong And dont even think about complaining Because they will get in your face and curse at you Very unprofessional Dont waste your time going there food is cold most of the time or youre missing an item Needs to be shut down
32774,1,Worst service ever no manager no attention for costumers
902,1,By far the worst of the franchise This location does not sell McDonalds recipes or guidelines 2 times i made a uturn for over salted fries that cant be eaten for the amount of salt put on them The burgers are not built to McD recipes they appear slopped together and backwards To top it off the packing is without care They mix multiple orders in different bags where another petson has to dig food out of another bagto putmy meal together This is serious ignorance laziness and incompetence management to say the least Need more prople to contact corporate about this location
20280,1,From the moment I pulled up after ordering literally had ZERO words spoken to me by the drive thru guy He just gave me dirty looks Then after taking my credit card he took his cell phone out looking like he was stealing my credit card information I asked for my receipt which was given with a hateful look but still no words I called MULTIPLE times and left multiple messages before I got a call back from a person stating they were the manager They said they pulled the video and he was just texting no picture He could be texting my credit card info I still dont feel comfortable with this and my card is still frozen Mcdonalds once they take my card is accepting responsibility for any fraud theft and PCI DSS compliance If their employee did in fact steal my CC I am filing criminal charges against the employee and McDonalds for not being PCI and PII compliant The auditor in me will not allow this Even if he truly is innocent the perception with the influx of cyber crime should never happen Do not have your cell phone out when holding someones credit card
933,1,Worst customer service ever will not return Food was cold and frys not cooked properly Bread had mold on it
904,1,According to both Google and the corporate website the drive thru at this location is 24 hours I have gone there multiple times recently to find cars parked in the lot lights on in the building and the drive thru signs lit only to wait several minutes with no acknowledgment I even pulled around to the window and honked and still received no response
32771,1,Horrible customer service
20281,1,Dont go eat here they will take about 6 minutes to cook your frozen apple pie then drag their feet till they feel like it to give the order to you  I paid at the counter at 403pm and got my order

18650,1,disapointed 
972,1,I WOULD LEAVE NO STARS IF I COULD DRIVE THRU ORDER IS ALWAYS PLACED CORRECTLY AND BILLED CORRECTLY ON THE RECEIPT BUT FOR SOME REASON THE LINE COOKS CANT GET THE ORDERS RIGHT EVERYTIME I COME TO THIS LOCATION MY  FOOD IS NOT MADE CORRECTLY TODAY I CAME THRU THE DRIVE THRU AND ORDERED A DOBBLE QUARTER POUNDER MEAL NO PICKLE MED WITH A COKE I WAS CHARGED 847 AND I GOT BACK TO WORK I OPENED MY FOOD AND A GOT A SINGLE QUATER PONDER WITH PICKLES A MED FRY THAT WAS HALF BURNT AS USUAL AND A DIET COKE I ONLY GET A HALF HOUR LUNCH SO NO TIME TO GO BACK AND COMPLAIN SO FOOD WENT RIGHT IN THE GARBAGE ON A PRIOR VISIT A FEW WEEKS EARLIER I WENT FOR LUNCH ORDERED A CLASSIC CHICKEN SANDWICH MEAL GOT BACK TO WORK OPENED MY FOOD I GOT WAY OVER COOKE FRIES AND A CHICKEN PATTY ON 1 BUN JUST THE HALF OF A BUN NOTHING ELSEI DID NOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT AGAIN NO TIME TO COME BACK 12 HOUR LUNCH    ON A SEPERATE VISIT I ORDERED A BACON SANWICH MEAL AND GOT NO BACAON ON MY BURGER I GUESS WHAT AM GETTING AT IS EVERYTIME I COME HERE THEIRS A ISSUE WITH MY FOOD I WILL NOT VISIT THIS LOCATION ANY LONGER AS WELL AS ALL MY CO WOKERS SINCE THEY HAVE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE  AND McDONALDS AT ONE POINT AND TIRE WANTED MINIMUM WAGE TO BE 14 OR 15 PER HOUR THATS A JOKE 
20323,1,The lady who took my order was on her phone She missed my order Had to order again to the manager and he was speaking rude The lady who gave me the remaining order literally threw it onto the table rolled her eyes over Not a good experience
20318,1,This particular location is by far starting to be the worst in alliance Their fries are always cold they sweet tea is nasty and the burgers are warm last week was our last time going to this location Weve found a better one
974,1,Was horrible Dry old and nasty All of us were so disappointed Thats pretty bad when a kid says it was horrible
977,1,The service was very slow today and they messed up the order The fries were old and hard They were cold
978,1,Terrible waited like 20 mins order 2 mcchicken and 1 mcdouble got 3 mcdouble smh
20325,1,Poor service They were super busy and took the orders pretty fast but they didnt make my order I waited 15 minutes for 6 nuggets and a small fry After several other orders that were placed after me were served I asked about mine and the lady handing out orders  just brushed me off I just asked for a refund instead which was a lot quicker Thanks for wasting my time Ronald wouldnt not be happy not happy at all
20326,1,"The manager himself throws fries inside the to go bag maybe 10 in the container and the rest all loose in the bag Has a salty attitude and highly unqualified position Not a good front for this business Recommend new management do the manager a favor and get rid of him I can only imagine how the food is prepared

PS The chicken nuggets taste like outdated breaded shrimp"
20327,1,I ordered a bacon smokehouse meal The lady asked chicken or patty No where on menu did it say chicken The only thing I received correct with my order was the drink I ordered beef and I received the chicken only I ordered the meal and didnt receive my fries Then the receipt said sandwich only with chicken Usually when you order its automatically a meal unless specified otherwise I ordered the meal she heard everything I said cause she repeated it back to me I will make my stops elsewhere
20328,1,I am only giving 1 star instead of 0 because the OTHER staff were great I listened to the manager verbally abuse the staff  customers The establishment was a disaster including a gentleman with no shoes picking at his toes in the back booth I feel sorry for anyone having to work under this manager Even when he managed the courtesy to pull a employee to the back to speak to them everyone was still able to hear the highly explosive conversation l do however commend the other staff for holding it together although i did see one staff member crying while taking orders after a conversation with said manager I pray UPPER MANAGEMENT reads this review and does something about this situation ASAP This is the worst review i have ever had to write and hope to never have to write such a review again
18642,1,Very badly
32743,1,This is the worst mcdonalds it seem everyone that works here is slow
32694,1,I made and uber eat at 4 am and they canceled my order at 548 am horibel service
20316,1,"Its unfortunate that after today  Ill be going to the McDonalds on Beach 3yrs here 7 days a week I order a large mocha   Ive seen the management change about 7 people and Ive made some friends
All those people are gone I made a direct complaint recently because Ive had enough  youd think Id go to a different McDonalds with that many issues right Well I dont think I should have had to drive further for their lack of customer service butits not changing My complaint was handled fast and efficient I come to retrieve my mocha and it tasted weird a couple of days ago I came back and was asked to park in 3 for it to be re made I then gave it back to the lady and told her to please let the manager know I wasnt satisfied with the drink we both laughed and she said ok
Yesterday I waited an hr because it was raining crazyfor a doordash They gave the wrong item first and I had to reorder
Today I go and retrieve my mocha again and the manager ask me how many were promised to me I let her know  the last one I came back and returned and told the girl somethings wrong with it  its taste burnt  The gm says  I saw you yesterday and I know I gave you a free mocha To methat is calling me a liar Especially when you repeat it after I tell you I didnt come yesterday  I doordashed and yall messed that up I also have dash receipts to show
She then says I didnt call you a liar but I know I gave you a free one She then tells me her staff shared that I drive up without ordering No Have you ever experienced that Im here daily When I told her her staff isnt at the window just as she wasnt when I pulled uptoday  she said something was wrong with the speakerNo accept some accountability  The last manager told me she was Rosa and thats not the same lady I complained on Anywho  I told her Im not the problem and Im not sure why this hasnt been fixed yet  but today Ive decided to switch locations lol drive further for good customer service Rosa thank you for at least responding today

LargeahotMocha"

938,1,No shakes or ice cream again and no sign to inform Long lines only to learn they do not have what I stopped in the purchase 
32759,1,Very bad service slow and dirty place Never go back again
20302,1,Walked in and we were completely ignored even though we were the only people in there  After about 10 minutes asked if they were serving people inside and the manager told us yes to give them a second She didnt even turn around and look at us  Waited another 5 minutes and still never received any service  By far the rudest manager Ive encountered at McDonalds
20303,1,I know McDonalds isnt known for customer service but this place is beyond rude Its a 247 location drove up to order nothing no response  Went inside the gas station and walked in  The grill chick looked at me after standing there a few mins I said excuse me  She looked at me then turned around and hid behind a stainless Steele shelf for a min Another min later Said hello once again no acknowledgement FINALLY three people come out from the back another min or so someone finally acknowledges me rudely food was burnt and to top it off i got food poisening
943,1,Didnt have kid meals toys Brought 8 kids to eat  no toys for none Also looked like 2 employees was high off drugs Will never eat there again Maybe no McDonalds

945,1,Screw up my order 90 of the time when I go through drive thrue BK is right next door I just go there now
960,1,Restaurant 42 the worst and the dirtiest trays that they put your food on that Ive ever seen complained about it before and nobody has done anything about it as of yet so if its restaurant 42eat at your own risk so if youre looking for a place to eat at McDonalds ask if its restaurant 42 before you orderthey tell me tell me to come back and youll make it right hows it going to do that when  they dont know its me coming back
32755,1,By far the worse McDonalds Staff playing on cell phones and manager goofing off in the back while a long line of people wait
32754,1,They always get my order wrong
20310,1,So I ordered from door dash  All my French fries were missing and I have 5 children all the sundaes and McFlurrys were missing  I called door dash and got credit for the missing items but as those of you know you dont get dash fee and delivery fee and tip credit when the items missing so I lost that money  I reordered all the missing items which included 3 Oreo McFlurrys2 fudge sundaes and one Carmel  I received 2 sundae and 1 McFlurry  Get door dash credit again but again loading the fees and tip  I try and call the store so the manager could at least talk to the parties who were making and packing and checking the order and tell them just be careful and pack everything on the receipt Just read it and check it But no first 3 calls it rang a few times and went to message that this store cant answer calls anymore It late it not rush hour at  care is taken to ensure the quality of the food they put out  Very disappointed in this store 
20311,1,They need to hire real English speakers It took me 10 minutes to explain my order Then my fries were so cold they must have prepared them last night I had to go back inside and wait another 10 minutes to get them replaced Meanwhile my burgers were getting cold There were 2 Mexicans ladies working the front and drive thru who seamed to be conversing and unbothered by THE customers in the lobby The Mexican man in the back was the only one working hard I dont know if anyone else was English speakers or not but all I saw was 45 Mexicans working at noon Photos included Management or owners need to periodically check to see if their restaurant is to standards
32752,1,Worst service and longest wait times out of any McDonalds Ive ever been to
20314,1,This is THE WORST MacDonalds I have ever visited First thing I noticed Four white customers standing in line and the black customers being served their meals The BLACK manager custom made their sweet teas reassured them that all you have to do is ask for me and Ill have your back They left more than happy Meanwhile the untrained cashier cannot prioritize drink expediting When one of the white customers asked the manager to assist the manager just looked at him and turned around In response that white customer left very angry before ordering After witnessing this obvious display of racism towards whites another white couple simply walked out without ordering Finally I ordered my meal A Big Mac meal It took five minutes to expedite my meal The black manager yelled out my number dropped the bag that contained my meal on the counter and turned and left No thank you no reassurance that I was pleased nothing I then waited 10 MINUTES for my large Coke The cashier who is responsible for making drinks didnt know how to get more ice or restock the large cups To top
32751,1,30 min wait    Dont come here
20315,1,"THE WORST MCDONALDS I HAVE EVER BEEN TO
I went there to order breakfast sandwiches for my crew to show them some appreciation for there hard work I ordered 20 breakfast sandwiches to get to job location and count 15 only in the bags I had to waste my time and gas to go back and get the rest for my crew  They should really double check there orders before handing them out Also they are rude and unprofessional You tell them the situation and they look at you like its your fault and dont even apologize for any inconvenience they have caused you Someone from corporate really needs to go clean house at this location As I am writing this I can also see all the other bad reviews about this location Thats gotta say a lot about the GM running this store and his employees "

30163,1,Ordered 2 cheeseburgers with no pickles I got 2 burgers with no cheese and pickles The establishment itself was clean kept and had a nice interior update to it The soda machine is a touch screen and you can add flavor shots to it if youd like So if you like Russian Roulette this might be the McDonalds for you

4164,1,The food is terrible Coffee is terrible the atmosphere sketchy
30167,1,If you prefer to talk to a person then DO NOT go to this location They only take orders made by kiosk in the dinning room
4148,1,"I bought an hazelnut coffee I received an extremely milky coffee and it didnt have any ice I asked what happened to the ice I was told they didnt have anymore So why allow me to purchase an ice coffee Hash brown was hard as an rock Sausage egg mcmuffin was just thrown together They need to get it together as far as Quality Control

I usually dont write reviews I felt compelled to do so"
4149,1,"Out of all the McDonalds restaurants this location had to be the worst  purely because of customer service
Last night 2210 whoever worked there needs to be let go We and other customers were yelled at  the virtual cash register was not working with the receipt so my boyfriend went to the front register to pay and the worker yanked the card out of my bfs hand sighed like super annoying When he turned around to wait  we heard him saying out loud customers are so stupid not listening 
Myself and some other customers got yelled at for sitting down I also needed go to the bathroom but didnt know it was shut but got yelled at Not sure what was going on with rather staff but rude did not cut it"

30170,1,If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here tonight The employee manager handling the front end was the rudest individual Ive ever met of all my visits to McDonalds in my 30 years Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for food One lady said shed been waiting on her food for over an hour They wouldnt even accommodate her with a refund Infact my order 25 took 40 min to fill The store shut down the kiosks as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the lobby I understand its easy to get overwhelmed but when youre filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an hour your prioritizing methods are failing And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy customers Im on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant again But if I were a local they would have just received their last 25 from my pocket My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller McDonalds in down town orlando the management  lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team poorly The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on duty McDonalds Id fix this ladies attitude or Id find her replacement
30169,1,This is the worst run McDonalds I have EVER seen in my life the service is super slow Its complete chaos The manager should be immediately terminated along with the rest of the useless staff I would rate it zero but that wasnt an option
15703,1,Its not open 24 h
4154,1,I ask for bathroom and they told me the manger take the key  Shame in you

4156,1,Very very poor service Employees screaming and yelling and cursing to guest So unprofessional
4157,1,You guys shouldnt have signs saying your open 24hrs if your not open 24hrs

30162,1,Took more than 30 minutes in drive thru with 5 cars ahead of me Not only the slowest McDonalds ever but by far the slowest McDonalds I have ever been to
4147,1,At McDonalds was trying to pick up an order for delivery come to find out a store that claims to be open 24 hours is closed please if you are not going to be open for 24 hours please turn off the UberEats app and off the 24 hour decal it
4182,1,Ordered few times here experience gets worse and worse Triple cheese burger only 2 paddies I paid twice because the first order got canceled because of internet issues they don
4184,1,Bought a coffee and after needed to use the restroom Manager impatiently said no when I asked to use theres then when I asked if they knew any nearby bathrooms he shrugged and turned around walking away I get the bathroom is closed but how about being prepared to help in a somewhat friendly way
4206,1,Bunch of bums working here
4207,1,My nuggets not only had a random piece of lettuce on top but bits of paper at the bottom of the box Not cool There wasnt

4212,1,Which 24 hours is this place open
4205,1,Absolutely unprofessional staff disorganized and angry They were so angry and SCREAMING out the numbers into a girls face angrily They were talking about jumping a girl And when I went to order I took a second to take my phone out to show her the deal I wanted and she snapped at me and said HELLO and repeated my order and said OKAY I said yeah but I have a deal I want to use She waved it off and said it dont work She was snapping her fingers and voice I literally just got there and she was just already angry standing there I took my card out to use and she said You have cash That dont work As if I knew She didnt state it beforehand What I didnt understand was everyone else before me ordered with a card So I just told her I dont have cash and walked off the line I saw people using their cards and when I saw that I got upset I just got done working a long day and I was tired and hungry and just wanted my McChicken and fries I got back on line and there was her friend The friend told me to insert my card I asked her if it works she said yeah I said so WHY did the other lady tell me otherwise Then the lady saw me on line again she said I just told her the app dont work why is she asking again I said Actually you also said the card reader doesnt work and it does so I wouldnt know whats true or not She said WHO DO YOU THINK YOURE TALKING TO ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE They both started laughing There was a pretty big spider walking around on the floor too All the tables were dirty And the guy cleaning was on his phone and rapping And looking at other customers butts She handed me the food harshly Theyre all children Immature children Absolutely disrespectful
4213,1,The service was slow there were 4 people ahead if me and only 1 cashier  Then it looks like the manager or supervisor opened up  They didnt have Sprite or HiC orange  Some guy in a black tank top got up from the table and walked to the back where they were preparing food Now I realized it was an employee not in uniform  Bathroom was out of order and every table that I went to was dirty  Its been a while since Ive eaten in there it looks like new management  Im concerned
4215,1,Terrible place filled with druggies and bums theres even a security guard who has to be standing there making sure everyones safe or kicking people out The seats are ripped and extremely filthy I could imagine bugs b
30150,1,"Please calibrate The Sodas Machine correctly

15676,1,This is the WORST McDonalds EVER Customer a Service here SUCKS They argue with you The customer is always rightbut at this establishment the Employees are right RunRunnever eat here
4218,1,Customer service is very poor For the frosty they added the toppings on top of regular soft serve and didnt even bother mixing in And when I asked for ketchup for the fries they handed me the ketchup box for me to grab some ketchup packets
4219,1,Good luck getting service I tried to order at the counter instead of the kiosk and stood there as 3 people directly on the other side of the counter ignored me for ages I could understand if it was busy but I was the only person there I finally gave up and went to Shake Shack
15675,1,Coffee cold  waited 20 mins for Hot coffee Mcmuffins edges Hard Just NOT satisfied with overall
15678,1,They took out the kids play area They consonantly mess up on order customers service sucks their phone is always busy no one ever picks uptoday my number 4 crispy chicken was not even cooked all the way 
15684,1,Employees are rude most of the time i dont know whyand they always argue with each other when i go in which is very often for the last couple of months and they are always slow
30151,1,"This location is incredible It has two stories Has automated machines to order from You can get a variety of different items to try out that arent at regular McDonalds Its always super busy here too so expect a wait

Im a local and I decided to try something different when a friend was visiting so we came here and ordered pizza I was so sick for the next three days that I couldnt leave bed Never again"

15693,1,Never get anything right I generally go to a further MCD to get better service
4190,1,Not terribly clean Stopped in and decided to buy snacks here as we also needed a restroom Sign was placed on the restroom marking it closed just after we received our order Coffee drink my husband ordered was certainly not coffee perhaps a milky product and lots of ice
30156,1,The worst McDonalds in the area I have lived close to this McDonalds for a little over a year now and have yet ever had a good experience My order is either not accurate or the food is unacceptable Also the team members and management just dont seem  to care Im not usually one to complain about things because I do realize this is a fast food restaurant however this last visit has really ticked me off I couldnt even place my order because the person taking orders in the drive thru was so incompetent and then she wanted to act like she couldnt hear me Other times I have visited this location  I have had an issue where items were left off my order so brought the food back to have it all replaced because by the time I got home and had to drive back to pick up my missing items it would all be cold I asked for my order to be remade and I legit watched this manager put my sandwich in the microwave  I could understand if I had a huge order to be replaced but it was honestly 3 items With that said I will not be back to this McDonalds location ever
15690,1,This place is so not wortheverytime I stop by here the food is never fully cooked and they have bad customer service
4194,1,I ordered my food online got everything perfect When I went to pick up my food I asked if they can show me which toys they had today because i wanted to collect all of they toys for my daughter They looked at me like i had 3 heads and said we dont have toys I replied no toys in a McDonalds Thats a shame They tell me they only have the old ones So i ask another worker who was extremely rude and ignored me the whole time She then says give me 1 minute while having her back turned so I didnt hear it especially with these masks on I wait a little and see her making little effort to help me as if i was asking for something not worth their time So I ask another employee and she points at the other employee saying ask her All I wanted was a toy for my daughter Those employees need to get out of there if they dont want to work there
15689,1,Not pleased Service is poor food was cold Dont waste your money here
4196,1,"Closed at 5am at a 24 hour McDonalds

4201,1,Worst employees ever Had to wait for 20 min and they pretend like didnt even know that they have my 
30161,1,Severely understaffed for such a busy location Ive seen McDonalds with more workers in locations in the middle of nowhere Expect to wait at least an hour for food and make sure to check your order before leaving as I and at least half of the patrons I saw leaving came back missing something
30172,1,I have no idea how the employees got hired They are so rude and have no manners They literally see you standing there for over 10 minutes waiting and no one offers to helpThey all need to stay home if they don

15733,1,Trashy  drive  nasty drive through Drove through that 2 weeks ago dead rat at drivethru still there
30202,1,Went new years Eve and was a disaster 4 employees in the heart of tourist districtWe ordered at Kiosk and waited 15 mins and saw that others that had been There for 25mins hadnt even paid for much less gotten their food Would have just done as much good to have shut the doors and locked as opposed to being open
15740,1,Not actually 24hours If you go late at night they
30201,1,I couldnt tell you much about the food or service because it wasnt open Supposedly 24 hour location but closed for maintenance  The sign had been updated closed from 11pm to 4am and then changed again to 5am I gave up hope at 520am when it didnt look like it was going to happen  Oh well good luck

30205,1,This Mc Donalds its always really slow Simple orders like a Quarter Pound and Mc Nuggets can take forever Im already waiting 40 minutes on Curbside Pickup and nothing It already happened sometimes I will not come back to this Mc Donalds anymore Terrible customer service
30206,1,Sat in the drive thru for 30 minutes before being able to order Part of the delay was due to another car deciding thier time was more valuable by cutting the line so it pushed three other cars besides mine back in line Two other cars followed suit so we couldnt even leave when we wanted to and were forced to stay and order because we along with the traffic trying to leave the parking lot was blocked in When I called to complain while forced to stay in line I was on hold for 6 minutes before hanging up because the manager didnt want to answer my call
30207,1,Unbelievably poor service Ordered 3 items 2 bagged immediately but then waited 15 mins for final item  a double cheeseburger By this time first 2 items cold so asked for a fresh re order  30 mins later Walked out with barely an apology Given the numerous bad reviews for this outlet you would expect a change in personnel Avoid if you can dont expect if you cannot
30217,1,How hard is it to give us the unsweetened tea we ordered instead of sweet tea We got on the hwy took the first sip and realized the ineptitude of the staff Too late to turn around
30216,1,We shouldnt  even be waiting for fast food more than 40 minutes  For order of chicken nuggets Please  Also they wanted to give us watered down drinks  I mean i know fast food   isnt easy but damn 40 minutes really give me a break Staff is extreamly slow Wont  be back
4069,1,Bad
30215,1,Horrible service stood there for 20 minutes trying to pay 600 for my food Manager was talking to one customer ignoring others workers were in back play fighting Drive through line was around the building and over 12 customers in line After 20 minutes asked if I could pay manager when she finally came by  register she told me I would have to wait very rudley and walked away She was very ride to customer in front of me also who had waited longer for his food Will never go back there and advise others to avoid this mcdonalds
30214,1,What a waste of time we were there in line for more than 30 minutes The woman at the window asked for our receipt and still did not get the order correct We spent 5 minutes at pick up trying to get it corrected  When I asked for my re eipt back she told me she lost it When I said I wanted the Manager she slammed the window shut The manager  said she put the order together from the receipt He stated the order screen only holds orders for 25 minutes Not sure what to think McDonalds at this location in the later evening I would suggest do not stop find another
15755,1,3 times in a row at 1025pm no coffe why is that Morning shift always has coffe
15754,1,No fun  received wrong order and was made to wait for correction
30212,1,"Good luck being served if you have questions about allergies We asked one of the employees to check the ingredients of the chicken nuggets to make sure there were no dairy allergens He asked his manager to check She straight out refused We couldnt even complete one of our orders

30 minutes after placing our other order we received fries so cold when I went up to the front to get fresh ones I didnt even have to say anything One of the employees brought me new ones automatically after the manager ignored my presence

The bathrooms were nasty the tables were dirty every trash can was over flowing and the whole lobby smelled like rotten fish This is easily the worst McDonalds in Orlando"
30211,1,What a horrible experience I sat at the front counter for over 15 mins for utensils and sauce on Dec 21st at 945pm The so called manager and the employees never once acknowledged me nor other customers that walked up for assistance with their orders that THEY messed up Honestly the manager should be fired or retrained she had no customer service skills or manager skills at that This mcdonalds makes the rest look bad
15751,1,Always attitude never get your order right cant stand that mcdonalds
15747,1,Im starting to think this food isnt very healthy
30208,1,Normally visit this location 4 out of 7 days a week usually early mornings and staff dont seem to want to be there which is ok because it is early 530am On 42119 the frappe machine is down for cleaning at 5am and now on 42219 the system is completely down Its becoming a place that isnt dependable

By the way when I entered he "
4112,1,"this is the worst mcd Ive ever visited
the illumination is dark atmosphere depressing and everything looked worn out
asked to order first in order to use the washroom so I ordered a coffee then the staff took a key and escorted you

15612,1,Anyplace that makes you park when going thru drive thru always will deserve 1 star in my opinion if I wanted to wait in the parking lot I would of paid thru curbside more angry watching cars that ordered after me get their food first

30065,1,Rainy first night in Orlando we went here after a super long day at Disney World We waited over 20 min for our food in the drive thru None of our order was correct and it was pouring rain so I did not want to go back through the slow drive thru I mean McDonalds is what it is but people go there for quick and convenient and those components were def missing on this particular visit 
15588,1,"I came with my family to enjoy a dinner
People working at 7PM on 100419 were discussing and talking very loud

30086,1,Terrible service waited forever for our food Wont be back

30083,1,Open 24 hours but not before 6am
15607,1,Food was good of course Thats why i gave it a star  but the restrooms and the restaurant was dirty Especially the playscape Full of stuck on and fresh bird poop
30081,1,Ill start with the positive The food I received was the correct order and it was hot The bad What was supposed to be a 10 minute trip ended up being almost 40 because they were severely understaffed and constantly giving out the wrong food to everyone Maybe theyre better during the day but definitely stay away from the midnight shift if youre looking to get in and out
15605,1,"Would NOT break my 100 bill because my order was only 648    i call it LAZY to satify the CUSTOMER 
They really need to have Pep talks in the mornings b4 they open  remind their stsff that THE CUSTOMRR IS ALWAYS RIGHT "
30078,1,Service at this place is a joke Sat in the drive threw for 20 minutes waiting of my food The tea is bad 60 percent of the time I believe this falls directly on management As there are always new employees there Most times having poor attitudes Also I have never once been suggested a pie I dont even bother pointing it out as it would only take longer And probably be un edible I only stop in there maybe once a month when Im in a bind
4360,1,Took mad long getting my mm McFlurry missed my X27 express bus the last one of the night all because they didn

15598,1,Very sad Explained that the food was saturated with grease and employees were uncaring and unable to make it right or didnt care A simple fix  was too much trouble
30077,1,Sometimes high tech doesnt mean faster Location has multiple self service kiosk meaning instead of taking orders one at a time you have several being made simultaneously Causing a backup waiting to get food inside while competing with drivethru Location still does not offer dining inside after ordering food They had just mopped with 20 customers inside so that was a safety hazard Not to mention I overheard someone tell one of the employees that something was broke in the ladies restroom causing water on the floor
30076,1,I am here in Orlando on vacation and I ordered via Uber eats and when I got my order the happy meal had no fries My large fries were half empty cold and soggy My deluxe chicken sandwich was cold as well I ordered a large sprite with it and it was flat and didnt taste right Tha

4349,1,Worse McDonalds Ive  had so far food tastes and looks like it was  made hours ago not made when ordered
30109,1,To whom it may concern Your curb at the entrance of Hawian Bvld at International Drive is dangerous to cars turning right to park The curb extends to far out to the drive and is blind to drivers in SUVs are high sitting vehicles I can tell by the damage to the curb that Im not the first to experience this and damaged was caused As a suggestion you may want to paint the curb bright red or install a Yellow caution post to alert drivers The right think to do would be to correct it

15664,1,Came through drive thru at 1130pm got no response  Website and stickers on building stated that they were open 24 hours
4247,1,This is the worst McDonalds in New York City The heroin users congregate at the main table in front of the register and they harass customers as they come in They nod off and just buy a soda or water to occupy the table for hours Theres homeless in front of the McDonalds and to the side and inside theres a lot of shady individuals that are just sitting there coming down off heroin highs The service is mediocre and the atmosphere is gross For it to be across the street from NYU this should be a whole nother level of security and quality
4248,1,Absolutely horrid customer service and even though I have lower expectations for a McDonalds in food quality this has particularly bare food taste and is often served sloppily Eye contact is optional in their employee training apparently
4249,1,They have a security guard who has the key of the restroom and he thinks he owns it he got upset because I was holding the door for my friend to use it cuz he was waiting too as I did the security guard doesnt come until 7 am so if you buy something before that you are not able to use the restroom until he comes the bathroom doesnt look from inside means that anybody can open the restroom while you still using it he also was arresting us cuz my friend took a little bit longer in the restroom and he ask me if my friend smokes I think that unprofessional
22754,1,I was sick for three days after eating a big Mac here
30134,1,The cashierservers look miserable and when you smile they just straight up look at you like youre vermin to them They lack personality and they rudely say stuff Even forgot 2 items out of my order Went up and got the wrong reciept printed and recieved attitude from the cashier who printed out my reciept
4245,1,I dont like MacDonalds in NY  Has a horrible attendance and this thing of asking to open the bathroom to be able to use is not pleasant On one occasion my niece went to make the request for all and the security said that if we were not going to buy nothing was to vacate the table
15661,1,Right now i am waiting in drive through the lady asking for orders is super rude and she thinks people are here for free food and giving tons of attitude worst experience am having RIGHT NOW
4256,1,Customer service is horrible Its law U cant reject TLC driver to use restroom Keep closed your one star toilet U dont deserve uber ride at all

4226,1,Staff Super Ghetto
4227,1,"Lousy dirty dangerous place Full of junkies crackheads and homeless people This place should have an armed security guard to keep it safe and clean  Do not bring children here Do not step foot in here Worst I have ever seen

15672,1,Health inspector was there and there was no ice it was a mess and if you look underneath the soda machine theres a river or soda under there probably molding
4230,1,"I ordered an MM McFlurry and paid Then they handed me an Oreo McFlurry and said they were out of MMs That is not what I ordered so it was very disappointing and annoying but since Id already paid there was nothing I could do but keep the Oreo Then when I asked for my receipt because I didnt want them to leave my credit card info on the counter they started explaining that theyre out of MMsa concept I understood even though I was annoyed about it
Also the bathroom is gross and the top floor is never open"
4231,1,Every franchise I have been to in NYC has been very disappointing Most team members not all loathe their job Furthermore I can never reliably tell if McDonalds is 24hrs anymore because of the inevitable 
4232,1,The night supervisor in grey is very rude Although it says 247 they often close around 1 am  Unless you order uber eats u are not able to come in and place your order
30143,1,"Another experience

I was asked to wait at drive thru No other customers were in queue They forgot about me The order was reduced without telling me The apple pies were removed without any explanation When I called to report the issue a woman who answered the phone saying she was the manager didnt identify herself She was rude and short and when I asked for her name she wouldnt provide it Bad experience with the food too The fries were so over salted I couldnt eat them and the big mac had so much lettuce and sauce on it I was wondering what happened in the kitchen End to end bad experience

Hello I came to your restaurant this morning and waited an extremely long time and was ignored by your staff I waited at the drive thru order kiosk then at the payment window and then at the pick up window Your staff saw me waiting making eye contact several times but continuing to ignore me I moved back to the payment window and waited while several cars pulled up waiting too When Mitzy who had ignored me finally opened the window was really dismissive with her demeanor before taking my order I asked why she saw me and continued to make me wait Her response was I just put on the headset Seriously that was her response There were at least four of the staff who saw me so I am really frustrated with your customer service Why didnt she acknowledge that she kept me waiting and just apologized for the delay like a normal person I was really offended that she was so flippant when I asked her about making me wait HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE and lack of basic human kindness NOT LOVING IT

Visited again on 3172018 and had the same experience Even the white shirt manager ignored me"

30131,1,This place was a mess They took FOREVER to serve the few people they had A guy dropped a spatula I was freaking out They would take counter order cause the manager said When we are done in the back So upset with this service
4263,1,Why did I ever think think that McDonalds had anything good for cheap The best thing is their overpriced fries The burger mouth feel was like tofu I hope millennials kill ol McDonald with their healthy spending habits
15656,1,Poor service cant seem to get orders right Then want to catch an attitude when you ask them to correct their mistakes
4265,1,Typical McDonalds experience Long lines Long wait considering what youre getting Rude ghetto employees Equally rude and ghetto patrons Just there for a cheap quick snack or meal
30119,1,Absolutely the slowest service Ive ever had at a fast food restaurant  Me and my 3 friends went and we all used the kiosk to order our individual meals  After 45 minutes and having to talk with the manager we finally got our food  There was one person working fries one cook on manager assisting the cook and one employee who was supposed to be putting the orders together and delivering to the customers  The last person walked around like a zombie who had no idea what planet they were even on  He would pick up a bag occasionally and put it back down and the clear orders from the system and not give anything to the customers Then when customers complained he would ask them what they ordered and the try to find food for the After seeing that 3 customers who ordered 20 minutes after me and my friends I asked to speak with the manager He proceeded to lie and said that once and order has been on for a while the automatic delete off the que  So he had no idea what any of us ordered We had to give him a receipt and the he helped us 10 minutes later All the trash cans were over flowing into the floor and the restaurant was very dirty   All the employees including the manager didnt even look 18 years old They were definitely under trained mis managed and probably under staffed

30373,1,For a prime busy tourist filled location the processes and procedures at this McDonalds are absolutely terrible  Many of the selfordering machines do not work when you use a normal line with a cashier its like the employees have never even been to a McDonalds before as they dont even know the menu items I ordered traditional chicken nuggets meal so it wasnt pasta or some sandwich that only special locations have  When you order at a kiosk you can order things they do not have such as a waffle cone ice cream  Then you wait 15 minutes to find out they dont have waffle cones and wait for an employee to make a fresh one which she doesnt know how to do so you end up paying 4 for a cup of ice cream  I did get my money back for the ice cream because I couldnt believe it took that long  Dont bother going here its not worth it unless you want to feel like youre waiting at Disney at a subpar place
15881,1,This place not clean at all  needs to properly be clean
15879,1,Not sure if they know what they are doing
3894,1,Terrible
15873,1,They always forget to give me something
15872,1,Bad night shift service employees hiding from giving service
30366,1,Employees just talk amongst themselves not fulfilling orders or payments as we sit in the driveways like dummies waiting for a bag of cold food Thanks guysall 3 times different days and times
22642,1,Typical McDonalds fare but this establishment lacks the basic facilities that humans need Ie theres no toilets
15894,1,Long line
30385,1,You can not get service at the front counter They only cater to drive thru and kiosk Past 2 weeks have stopped and after 10 mins no one would take order after having 3mgr look at you

15903,1,Wait time is crazy long And there rude
30401,1,Waited 25 minutes in the drive thru with 7 cars in line Not busy just poorly managed
30398,1,Cold food expensive to take advantage of the tourists and poor service
30396,1,The service and food was terrible It took so long to get it that I didnt want to wait in line another 20 minutes Manager didnt care about us
30395,1,Used the drive thru Ordered three large fries Paid for three large fries Received only two large fries and no receipt was given to me so I couldnt go in and prove that I ordered three
3867,1,Terrible
30394,1,Very over priced but did bump into my nan so we did have a good catch up about Corrie but there is a much better place near BURGER KING The straws are thicker and the drinks are cooler I would of gave macdonalds 3 stars but the old women in front of me how took 2 mins and 47 seconds to decide Yes I counted Drew the final straw

30502,1,Epic McDonalds on International dr Is lacking customer service  Had the coupon for free Happy Meal from Visit Florida  They didnt want to give it to us because we downloaded from site and printed not from tourist booklet  Then said it was not actually for a happy meal  Just drink fries and burgernuggets  No box toy yoghurt or toy  even though the coupon stated HAPPY MEAL  no small print  Girl at drive thru wasnt nice  Prices at epic McDonalds are quite a bit higher than the other locations and no 123 menu

30490,1,"Mario  glasses dark hair What an irresponsible manager Left everything to manager Stephanie whilst he disregarded customers Food missing from orders another customer young teenager  spoken to like dirt by a female member of staff
I tried to complain about Mario who did not respond appropriately couldnt be bothered to make any verbal response but had to wait forever for Stephanie as she was putting out fires all over the restaurant You could not pay me to work with Mario or the newly appointed manager who was called to speak with me  but never came over despite eye contact and him making a grumpy soundyoung black guy who was more into showing off in front of the young female staff than treating any woman with respect
What ever the main manager Stephanie is being paid isnt enough I saw her run rule command the show in a way that got the job done She was gracious with all customers whilst her staff were ignorant gits"
30489,1,Service is slower than molasses in January Also the order stations did not print a receipt and when I went to claim my food they wouldn

30518,1,Worst drive thru times Waited like 20mins to get my order This is not the first time either I gave them the benefit of the doubt and it happen again tonight
16053,1,They always lack something or they dont give you the right order
30517,1,"It literally took my boyfriend an hour and 13 minutes to receive our food two meals
I get it  things happen and its one thing to be understaffed but maybe corporate needs to step in to save this location

16052,1,Very bad service they are not friendly and do not want to serve I DONT LIKE
16051,1,Unprofessional attitude of the selfservice attendant today 0722 at 1028 am
30514,1,Pathetic we placed 4 orders all 4 were incorrect not busy and utter chaos ONE PLACE TO AVOID    needs a good manager to control things
16049,1,From my experience today they have a bad job with the drivers who do Delivery they take time to prepare the orders and when they are ready they forget to take them to the drivers and with an APOLOGY they solve it they should be more responsible that is their work like ours is to make the Delivery on time
30513,1,Wait time of over 30min and then they had the order completely wrong after repeating the entire order again at the pay window Not fun after a long day of travel and you are just looking for the normalcy of a dang McDs
30512,1,Terrible experience Came this morning at 428am no egg whites no scrambled eggs for big breakfast Long story short waited almost 25 minutes to get the order Unacceptable
16047,1,This place is horrible I do not recommend it to anyone I stopped by for a breakfast for my children and their friends The bread was spoiled They should be more careful with their inventory and when giving the food
16045,1,They dont have staff the ice cream machine doesnt work They dont have smoothies Orders take a long time Definitely very bad service
16044,1,My opinion is very simple I asked and a lady sent me to number 2 I was there for more than half an hour and when I wanted to enter the place they closed the door and I went through the window to remind Mrs Anglica who was the one who told me if she wants to come in and grab her coffee she was very rude and she closed the window for me but this place doesnt give a

15969,1,Mc Dont go here
22566,1,Got fries tasted super old and stalemold growing on them Puked all night
30442,1,Raise all their prices due to the Convention center Some sandwiches raised by 3 As a company this large they should be able to keep the prices lowered rather than ripping off all the people in the area
15963,1,worst service ever
30441,1,Went there today and went through the drive thru and the girl taking my order was very rude so I told her get the manager  and she was rude as well Poor ass customer service if you ask me the dont even deserve my one star

22551,1,Food poisoning  24 hours of vomiting and diarrhea   Way to ruin the first day of my honeymoon
30460,1,Terrible service Waited at the drive up speaker for minutes before anyone asked for my order  Then proceeded to wait in the line for over 10 mins  If someone has food that is taking longer you should pull them up
16001,1,Good
22540,1,Would not answer me when i called
30480,1,Waited at the register with one person in front of me for about 20 minutes without one employee even acknowledging our presence  I left and went to Dennys

3773,1,Mediocre
30472,1,Costumer service is terrible approached register to order was told they were to busy i had to use the self service computer talked to a lady looked like a manager she asked the casheir to take my order but then i heard how she told her to keep sending people to the computer Managers are rude and not well dressed
30470,1,Worst experience Drive thru line was longggg I left the line and came back again at 1215am by then it was closed 24 hours
30468,1,Not very good customer service at all except for the manager more training needed to deal with people
15994,1,Service is horrible
30466,1,I am so tired of these franchises ripping off customers and upscaling the prices on items that are supposed to be a dollar McDonalds just needs to take down this 1 2 3 deal It seems as if every McDonalds I go into now is ran by either Hoodrats or Morons that are unable to perform their job duties
30463,1,Took 15 mins to pick up my mobile order 3 ppl working there and nobody knows where my order was When I got it its already cold
3784,1,just gamine
30462,1,Worst service ever They didnt have everything in my order and then look at me like I did something wrong Actually wouldnt even look at me I will never comehere again
22546,1,Terrible long lines and the way it works is unlike any other McDonalds which entails fighting your way to the counter and making sure the employees pay attention to you
22550,1,Costs 50 more than elsewhere in the us and customer service is twice as bad place an order online or on the kiosk to avoid rude employees and you still need to pick up your order
15869,1,Thanks Williams for making me hate McDon
3902,1,Bad
22659,1,The salad was brown and they asked if I wanted anotherumnooooo
15777,1,I dont know what to say Ronald your car just went over the cliff Food was terrible
15776,1,Says is 24 hrs but there was nobody there at 310 am on July 19 2019
30274,1,By far the rudest customer service I have ever encountered I went around 332am on Sunday went to the drive through my husband asked what comes with the crispy tenders meal she responded so rudely ugh fries and a drink what else he laugh and asked if she had a long shift cause that was really sarcastic and again she responded rudely  cause who doesnt know that  I dont work at McDonald why should I know what comes with a meal every place is different regardless its no excuse to be rude to a customer
30272,1,at Night they didnt give happy meal drink they have a sign for if they dont  offer new dessert they will give a free dessert But they never mention about it So I requested them to give a free dessert They dont want to give a free dessert
15775,1,If this was last place on earth and I was hungry  Then maybe I think about going there Than maybe I would die before I ever go back this dump
15774,1,They never have  Fresh food or my food is missing
30277,1,No napkins inside and the buns on the sandwiches we ordered were on hard bunsthe sandwich and nuggets we ordered tasted like they were made a few hours agoI dont think Ill be coming again
30269,1,We went here late night after EDC Around 2am we waited about an hour to get our food Whatever its the night of EDC so it was crowded ok In a 22 order we were missing 2 items equaling 8 and a sweet and sour sauce that they charged me 2 for After going back and telling them what happened they argued I eventually got the egg sandwich and double bacon cheeseburger which ended up having no bacon Still never got that 2 sweet and sour
15773,1,Horrible service can never my meal right
15772,1,This place is always out of Ice Cream They also close at midnight when online it says open 24hrs
30265,1,Terrible processed unhealthy food that squarely contributes to the diabetic and obesity epidemic especially with the underprivileged  Went only as an emergency
30264,1,"The manager at this location is Mike I was the only person in the drive through Mike opens the window and hands me my food and walks away I looked him right in the eye and asked for BBQ sauce This is how little Mike cares about his job and helping his customers

Pure laziness at this location"
30262,1,Super impolite drive thru and cashier We had to repeat the order three times bc she was talking to someone else and they didn
30261,1,New and clean but horrible service
4017,1,Bad
30278,1,Hire more staffing during evening hours Waited about 25 min with only about 4 cars ahead of me before finally giving up Be more proactive and tell customers if there will be a long wait
30279,1,Order from the kiosks cause all the POS were unmanned and closed Paying by cash made this a pain but not only that as everyone else was ordering and having thier order number shouted across the restaurant we waited and waited until after 30 mins got uo to ask how our order wasnt called or even on the board we were told we had to queue to replace the order and pay Utter farce after being here multiple times and having no problems this was a shambles and insulting
15778,1,Just ate here and it was awful  Only reason they are in business is the name
15788,1,Seems like everything about our order was wrong Ugh
22707,1,Mad man poop and splash it all over the outdoor table and eating areanasty sight
30293,1,Very poor 22 minutes of waiting on my order to be wrong and it was sitting on the back counter the whole time Didnt say anything because I knew I hadnt ordered what was on the tray Employees only wanted to do one thing and passing the buck to someone else The kiosks dont work properly The line to get your money is quick enough but the wait is ridiculous Only 6 words of English amongst the whole crew Thand you I sorry Come again Wel here are 2 more for you Never Again
15784,1,is this mc open i see its 24 hr but the drive way is always close when i go there
30290,1,No inside seating Rude employees that barely noticed I was there No napkins in my bag and no one asked or seemed to care if I needed any I had to remind them my meal came with a drink
30289,1,We ordered on the online tablet and we sat down and waited for 15 minutes and got tired of waiting so we went to the front and was told that our food was given to us ten minutes ago and it wasnt clearly They remade the order and of course it was incorrect so I had to go and get them to fix it again
30287,1,We are British but never had the same problem on our many visits to Florida He persons taking our order just didnt understand what we were asking for Very frustrating seeing as our language is almost identical
3998,1,Bad
15783,1,Just rude  the food sucks very cold  not cooked

30283,1,They were out of chicken and ice cream Waited 40 minutes on the drive thru to get our food Cash only Their credit card system was down
15781,1,No one answered drive thru the employees were on their phones
15779,1,Worst drive thr ever

30258,1,I went through the drivethru the drivethru was closed so I came in the kiosk was not working right and the lady would not take my order so I left
30257,1,Seriously you have one job Ordered a stake egg and cheese on a bagel they served it on a biscuit Ordered a egg McMuffin served a Sausage egg McMuffin Best part about it A MANAGER walked it out to my car Y
30256,1,It took 26 minutes for them to make 5 double cheeseburgers I asked the manager Daniel why he said they just completed a large online order I told him this was the 2nd time in a month I had to wait an outrageous time for fast food and he just starred at me blankly Eventually Daniel told me I was holding him up and making other people wait I thought that was pretty rude and unconstructive for a manager to say Terrible location regardless of how busy it is it almost always looks like a warzone inside with trash everywhere and nasty dirty tables and the wait time for food can be really ridiculous and on top of all that the staff is rude
30241,1,It was awful 45 min to get lunch Lines of people complaining  No ice in the soda machine  Told them we wanted are money  back  They found are food
30240,1,"Just went through the drive thru young lady at payment window needs additional training on what is considered proper customer care  She was having a full on conversation with a coworker related to a personal matter candy she had sitting on the counter next to her the other coworker indicated she had a customer to which she stated  I dont care  She continued her conversation leaving me sitting there until she finished Never said hello or thank you
Once I received my food it was in a bag dripping with grease
I should have driven a quarter mile up the road to Wendys
Shameful"
22716,1,I agree with Ed and after this Ill never return at other MacDonald and they called this a restaurante place my gd
30239,1,It was already a bad experience from the moment I met the window attendant at Pickup 1  She told me we ran out of eggs and just left me there at the window without telling me they were making more Then she came back s few minutes later and handed me my foodBig Breakfast which is supposed to come with OJ and I asked for salt and pepper and she said it was already in the bag which it is NOT and then shut the window in my face The meat wasnt fully cooked and the eggs still runnie I walked in to find out she is the actual manager I told her I was about to shut the window in my face I was gonna ask for Ketchup She then snarkley replied I didnt shut the window in your face Have a nice day
30238,1,Ordered a spicy chicken sandwichbit  into the sandwich and it was a bit hard to chew the sandwich was undercooked not happy with this at all
15758,1,They arent 24 hrs dont speak English and has very rude employees
30235,1,There was one car in front of me when I pulled up at 5am More than 20 minutes for a single egg mcmuffin I was given no explanation or apology for the wait either Im honestly appalled at the poor service especially at such a nice location I will literally never come here ever again
30233,1,Wish I could give a ZERO food was horrible and the whole order was wrong paid extra for cheese no cheese no mayonnaise on anything Food was cold and to top it off the dime size tomatoes on each sandwich 7 sandwiches and 2 were right cant post the pictures on here or I would service unacceptable
30230,1,I usually frequent McDonalds at least once a week whether its to grab a coffee or get some pancakes for my little one This visit was probably the worst Ive experienced I ordered my food at 911AM  A mcgriddle a coffee and two hashbrowns Once I paid I was immediately told to go to 1 so I did After waiting until 930AM with no one in the drive thru line anymore I went back around where a female with red hair came walking out with a guy who looked like they knew each other After handing me my bag I asked about my drink and she said What drink I said the coffee thats listed on the ticket you provided me along with the receipt She said okay and then CONTINUED to hold a conversation with the guy standing right in front of me I waited an additional 2 minutes and she was still talking and laughing with the guy while me a customer was watching her and patiently waiting for my coffee Needless to say my patience went thin and I told her to forget about it and I had to leave I paid for something I never received and was treated with the most disrespect in my book Coming from a long time McDonalds customer I wont be back again
30229,1,Absolutely one of the worst experiences ever at McDonalds Ordered a ice coffee and cappuccino at 1013 pmwaited and waiteddrive through backed up 2030 people inside waiting absolute chaos Finally at 1047pm the lady asked what I ordered and made them so I could leave Literally 35 minutes for coffee Horrible experience short staffed and totally out of control
30228,1,Employees I dealt with were rude When they got our order wrong they tried to blame it on us not ordering right We showed them the receipt and still refused to admit they were wrong The girl went to the back and came back with the right order didnt say anything or make eye contact just handed me the bag This is the rudest I have ever been treated at any establishment fast food or not I recommend everyone drive a little farther up the road to the next McDonalds than deal with what I had to deal with
30227,1,Warning avoid this location at all costsTruly one of the worst McDonalds in the nation Theres always an issue in the drivethrough theres always an issue when you go inside the store The staff is not friendly not greeting when you walk in the door they have no idea what the 3 ruled is Whoever their trainer is should be ashame when they have the McDonalds conference in Orlando Florida If I could give them negative stars I would When you go through the drivethrough there is not a proper greeting It as is if you are bothering the attendant taking your order There is no quality service Its all about quantity instead of quality
30226,1,If I could give this less than 1 star I absolutely would I spent 30 minutes in line just to get 2 meals and 2 ice creams for my kids Waited 15 minutes just to pay and another 15 to get our food Will NEVER recommend this location to anyone The sad part I didnt have high expectations because it was late on a Saturday night and all of the theme parks were letting out and even my low expectations were shattered
15756,1,Horrible horrible service extremely filthy place and not one individual could speak proper Englishshame on you if you bring your kids or family here
30221,1,"Id like to start off by saying so far I love the employees they have great attitudes they act professional and real kind

So I stop by almost every morning and have come to realize their apples pies are often hard as a rock This is becoming to be a real problem at this location They also dont put the  best by  stickers on them  I"
30242,1,Spent over 30 minutes waiting in line at the drive thru at around 9 pm Finally placed my order of 2 egg mcmuffins Recieved 2 egg mcmuffins that must of been sitting since the morning hours from breakfast The white portion of the egg was almost black They are supposed to make them fresh after breakfast hours not serve on from 12 hours prior
15789,1,"Locked restrooms just for employees
What is they problems they have to take costumers"
30243,1,Horrible service waited over 40 min for my cold food No one wanted to speak up but i did manager turns around and tells me we are short staffed but no excuse for them dragging their feet and cracking jokes to each othertotal opposite of a FAST food joint I would of had better luck and service an actual sit down place
30244,1,Store is unprofessional not open during business hours When does that happen at mcdonalds Not a good look
4029,1,Bad
15770,1,They don
15769,1,Every time I go there I ask for apple pie instead they put cherry pie inside the apple pie container
30255,1,One of my worst experiences at a McDonalds ever   I waited in a line at the drive through for 20  minutes  Get to the first window where I hand them my card and end up paying for someone elses order   Waited longer to correct that situation  The order at the window was wrong  Waited some more for that to be corrected  Finally the lid to my soda wasnt on so when I went to grab it in the car the lid popped off the cup and spilled all over me
30254,1,Horrible customer service tried to order at the register and the manager talked to me like I was a child and had to order at the kiosk Mean while half the kiosk in the building was not working
30253,1,Employees just hate being there Not one person said thank you please you are welcome Just Whats Your Order Pull around here Put people who actually want to work and a friendly Its not that hard
30252,1,"The ONLY reason I gave this place one star is because I couldnt give it ZERO
we ordered on a kiosk at McDonalds because the counter line was too long  Come to find out its because the kiosks werent taking payment  I then proceeded to wait in line FOR AN HOUR to just PAY for my food  When I asked for a refund for my friends food the manager pointed at food that had been sitting there no less than 10 mins and said its coming  Uh no  Needless to say we got our refund and ended up going across the street to iHOP instead  Shout out to the waiter at iHOP and the whole staff for doing so much better than McDonalds"
15768,1,Store is 24 hour went in at 745pm and they were closing Wont go there again
15767,1,Man these guys are 24 hrs  I came here about 1 am and they said they where closed try someone else  sound like some kids running the show there
15765,1,Took absolutely forever then theyre card reader didnt work
30248,1,WORST MCDONALDS EVER unfortunately I cannot leave less then 1 star They have 10 automatic screens to place your order from but only if you want breakfast cant order lunch from them A completely waste of my time and money Your better off going across the street to Burger King and getting a whopper
15764,1,Not open when they are suppose to be 24 hrs very unhappy
15763,1,Its Mcdonalds go to In and Out burger or P Terrys or the million of other better burger places here in Austin or anywhere
30246,1,"Our order was messed two days in a row when visiting this McD on vacation

The first day they rang up our at the drive thru incorrectly AND didnt even match the incorrectly charged order Second day we ordered at the kiosk inside and they didnt give us 2 of the items we ordered an apple pie and hashbrown

Not sure if there"
30245,1,HORRIBLE It took 54 mins to get our food and then it was nasty We watched the manager mix sweet and unsweet to fill a mans tea Noone ever asked for our order so we pulled forward at the window Will NEVER stop at this location on our way home from Seaworld EVER
15761,1,Ill never go to a McDonalds I have not been to one since last year
15587,1,One minute after closing 101AM Sorry bro I already turned off all the machines COVIDNO MORE CUSTOMER SERVICE
15790,1,This is the slowest most disorganized McDonalds I have ever eaten at And I have eaten at McDonalds all over the western half of the US
30298,1,This has to be the WORST experience ever at a fast food place We used the kiosk and were thrilled because we placed the order faster than the workers that were ignoring us at the counter THEN they only brought 14 of our order Forgot our 4 McCafe drinks and condiments Then when one of the teenagers told someone at the counter he was told to ask someone else Really You want 15hr for this I had low expectations because no McDonalds gets the order right but damn
30345,1,This McDonalds needs work By far the worst and most over cooked food Ive ever had Just bought a cheeseburger and it tastes and looks like it was reheated in the microwave The worke
30344,1,Plug ins dont work also took 20mins to order the cashier was just standing in the back Asked about the plugs in she told us that its not their problem Horrible service

30326,1,Bathroom it was a disgraceful experience Lobby tables dirty Drinking fountain super dirty Hamburger box came oily Unfortunately it was NOT a great experience and cleaning McDonalds Better to give up on McDonalds for once and for ALL You can base a restaurant by their bathrooms
30325,1,Stopped in to get breakfast and there was mold on my bagel and the oil must havent been changed in a while because the hash browns tasted like old oil instead of hash browns Never will stop there again
30324,1,Never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant which is a big deal for me to say since my 3 year old is allergic to many things  This morning around 1228 am 112418 when asked the very standard  may I see the food allergy menu or since that wasnt available would you mind checking the ingredients on the package while I wait to place my order while others go ahead the cashier was told by the manager right in front of me that she would not get the menu nor would she check the ingredients and went right back to laughing and carrying on with another employee  The same manager stood around looking at others needing help during the rush without any movement or intention to step in for her team or their long waiting customers  The entire place was in disarray from the back to the front with filthy tables floors and bathrooms  Every trash can in the place was overflowing and the pungent smells both in the lobby and the restrooms were enough to make anyone lose their appetite  Black Friday or not absolutely unacceptable brazen behavior from management that I would never tolerate under any circumstance from my own team at any level of the company  Zero starswould not recommend
30323,1,Worst McDonalds experience  ever  Silent 25 mins in drive thru  When ordering we were advised could not sub drink in meal with McFlurry and had to purchase separately  When finally making to window to pay they couldnt find my order  For this to be in a Prime location in Orlando  they completely failed the meaning of fast food
30321,1,Terrible service I order a few things and had to wait over 20 minutes in order to receive my items No one approached me and another guy when we were standing at the cashier for over 10 minutes Not even the managers I had to ask one of the employees if they actually had a cashier

30316,1,Horrible service Whoever that moronic lady working the counter register at 1150 pm on August 15th 2018 is she should be shoved into a corner of the rear of the store indefinitely The fact that she couldnt grasp the English language isnt even the worst of if On top of that she had an attitude and acted like her doing her job was an inconvenience I get it it

22847,1,While sitting down eating A manager was arguing with an elderly gentleman Very disrespectful Will never got black again
22839,1,I understand the profitdrive to push automation but it seems to not work here 35 minutes wait for two standard egg McMuffin meals mid morning is unacceptable for fast food
22848,1,"Lst night the cashier wouldnt assist in exchanging a nugget meal for a nugget happy meal due to their broken kiosk misplaced the order Neither would sell the toy itself to help a child get their wanted toy instead sold a seperate happy meal box Coffe was cold too

Next day went bck hoping to get a different experience the guy on the floor was really nice and polite but the middle eastern cashiers not so much Im standing their waiting to be assisted but instead the latina looking and the middle eastern had a more important conversation of how to remove her nose piercing and how to clean it Also she was manipulating her nose while at the csshier So so disgusting Grosss"
22852,1,I ordered the 2 for 449 crispy chicken biscuits for breakfast and they gave me the 2 for 3 mc chicken sandwich and then when I asked the manager Monicawhy was i charged so much for sandwiches I didnt order she told me that she was shortstaffed and didnt have time to fix it and gave me an attitude
22855,1,this mcdonalds is not open 24 hours despite all signage and hours posted an employee rudely shooed me away when i showed up at 130 AM
22859,1,Take your service else where save your time Manager is unprofessional and rude and so is the staff OH and btw if you are a tourist they dont accept more than 2 orders if you

22863,1,A Big Dog was unleashed in the restaurant Seriously I love animals but I have some allergy reactions

15371,1,"This place is always awfully busy and slow Not their fault

But we are very unsatisfied with the treatment received at the drive thru the other day You dont call out your clientele for whatever reason especially not in such a blunt rude fashion If Ra"
15370,1,After decades of serving families McDonalds is on their way out I blame it on the district managers not doing their jobs McDonalds needs individuals who can read comprehend and speak English Today I went there for lunch I ordered 6 FiletoFish sandwich meal I ended up with 10 peice chicken nuggets HmmmmI  guess the order taker did not know the menu item or understand when I said FiletoFish sandwich I quickly caught the error and told the cashier She said So you dont want it Then the manager came along to find out what the problem was I  explained and received the sandwich I left and when I  got home I found out I  had a frosted breakfast pastry in a FiletoFish box Come on now McDs May we get better service and expect a lot more from you If not please close your doors to save the public from the irritation
15369,1,Theres a reason why theres mainly 5 stars and one star reviews for this McDonalds I will say about 50 of the time its good and then the other half is horrible One time I went before breakfast ended And place my order Got to the first window to pay for the order and then when I got to the window to pick up my order they told me they couldnt do breakfast anymore Another time I went inside around 7pm and despite the door being open and plenty of employees chatting and talking instead of working they said they were drivethru only currently Another time the line wasnt that long but took a good 20 minutes to get through and when I got to the window to pick up my order they had more employees inside talking and chatting Theres been a few times some lady taking the order wasnt friendly and kept rushing orders by asking anything else  I will say though that the food has almost always been hot and correctly ordered that is the only good thing about this location
22821,1,Sign indicates free item if the person taking your order doesnt ask about rewards The Male taking our order didnt ask We told them at the window The manager told us the girl that took our order did ask us we explained that it wasnt a girl it was the man To which she rolled her eyeswalked away and didnt return We also didnt recieve our bottle water napkins  nor straws for the drinks we did get
15367,1,Disgusting I felt a nasty Baby roach In my bag of food This is an outrage And this place should be shut down Try to get it resolved by manager And just complete disbelief Of the manners this woman had  Infested With roaches sick poor service  Disgusting establishment
15366,1,I order my food ahead of time online Only to get there 25 minutes later and its not even ready The large fry I ordered was 34 of the way full there was absolutely no ice in my drink which was a lemonade and tea so its not like it was cold like the sodas come out of the machine and they were practically shoving me out the door when I asked for ketchup and salt By far one of the worst customer service experiences Ive had
29775,1,Terrible
22824,1,Lucky they even get the rating they do Placed a mobile app order at 949am and was still waiting for 3 sandwiches 45 minutes later Not a single person acknowledged me standing at the front counter but had no problem passing orders out to those using the kiosk Go thru the drive thru to be given the excuse that their short handed yet I spent 45 minutes INSIDE and seen plenty of employees My order was wrong twice Absolutely cold food Sent a complaint to corporate because this is unacceptable This location is full of tourist and I hate for these people visiting our state and area to be treated the way I was Absolutely uncalled for
15363,1,10 cars in line no one taking orders went to the first window and she said she couldnt take my order to go to the next the next window had a huge attitude and got smart with me saying she cant take my order either and dont know why the first window told me that So I asked where I should order and she said not here and when I asked her again she said to come in the lobby So I drive around and tried but the doors were locked so I went back to the window again and she took my order and then I get home to find the crispy chicken sandwich I ordered is just bread pickles and sauce No chicken Dont even want to waste my time going back Last time I ordered it I got a spicy mcchicken which is also wrong Learn the menu care about your customers I will not be returning to this location
15362,1,I repeated my order numerous time and he repeated Get to the window and review the order and it was wrong The employee was debating the order and ask to speak to a manager And to my findings it was another employee that did the same debate I ask numerous time if he was supervisor or manager and he said yes False Ask for corporate number and dumv found Was asked to pull forward and they wound bring out my order Four cars passed and I walked onto the store and a white female dressed in store uniform appeared after a wait period to give me the order In the car open order Fries old and burger burnt Just sad The order was trashed
15361,1,We waited 20 minutes for our mobile order till we went up to a worker and told her we had a mobile order She walked away without even saying anything and came right back out with our food which was probably just sitting aside the whole time The fries are old I even took a picture to show I understand dine in is closed but at least be consistent with your mobile orders and kindness goes a long way she needs more training
15359,1,Terrible
22827,1,"Food was cold drinks missing
The manager is rude the advertising is false She accused us of lieing when we said we werent asked about the rewards to receive the free cookie  Very hostile "
22829,1,Not satisfied with purchase Female manager messed up my order twice My tripple hamburger looked like someone added two miniature paddies on a normal size burger I would recommend that this supervisor pays attention to receipts and ask for additional help in order to avoid mistakes
22831,1,If I could I would give 10 stars because I stayed here in Orlando all week and they never wanted to take my order they locked all the doors at night they say they close at 11pm and for example I arrived at 940 and they told me that it was closed please McDonalds do something this is happening to me all nights Im from Mexico and I dont have a car or the App from here even if its the same is different they are rude and not attentive 
29730,1,Terrible
15372,1,Drove up to lane 1 to place order Waited to be acknowledged 2 vehicles drove up to lane 2 while I continued to wait and placed their orders before me I pulled ahead to the window never being acknowledged at drive thru speaker When I pulled to the window I stated that I was never acknowledged and didnt get to place my order I was told that I could not place an order at the window and to go back through the drive thru I chose to go to another location I submitted a formal complaint about their policy through their app Be prepared for drive thru customer service inconsistency if you go to this location
22864,1,The lady at the drivethru window was so rude and angry for no reason that I cancelled my order and drove away The lady would only answer with one word answers and was not even polite Drove to BurgerKing across the street where I was treated nicely and my order was completed with no problems or childish employees
22865,1,Large capuchino The second picture with the flash light was other day take your own review about it IT IS A 
22898,1,"We have visited this McDonalds twice now using the drive through It took forever both times  the car in front only ordering 1 or 2 items First time it took around 10 minutes to order and then we had to wait for the food another 10 minutes
Second time too"
22899,1,Not greeted when entering employees refused to acknowledge us while we waited to order just to be told by another guest that we have to use the kiosk An employee walking to the bathroom confirmed this Kiosk doesnt accept cash and touch screen was not responsive Decided to go to drivethru and waited a few minutes just to pull off and go to chickfila where they still know how to serve its customers
22900,1,Raw meat Dont go here second time happened to me
22902,1,"Kid wouldnt take our order with cash but took a single girls order with cash

22913,1,My family and I came here and we were all disappointed They were not welcoming and they had a line didnt even bother asking anyone what they needed The people needed to stop the worker and ask for what they needed no one was ever at the counter We are Hispanic and we also felt discriminated against because the lady at the counter didnt want to give us refills and didn

22914,1,The food is no good for you since I have found out since the last time I reviewed this that there is pork in their hamburger I will not be going there anymore I should sue them as what I should do I havent ate pork in 20 years very disappointing and you would think a big establishment like this could get turkey bacon or turkey sausage
22915,1,Waited 19min for a single happy meal Drive thru was not overly busy 23 cars past the order area Dining room had moderate amount of guests ordering and waiting never more than 56 groups I counted 8 workers I just needed a hamburger and 2 happy meal fries
4877,1,Bad
22917,1,lve paid for hot drinks but they didnt have hot drinks So funny Than they return my money in to my bank account but less than l have paid They didnt refund as full amount
15261,1,Slow as hell
22893,1,My husband and I wanted to do a combo through the mobile order but the drink machine was shut down The Manager Keith went out of his way to be rude and shut us down with a No cant do it when we asked for a orange juice for the price of the soft drink scene the soft drinks were not available because soft machine was broke As we stood waiting for our food he was being very condescending and also maid comments like he can
22892,1,Took 20 minutes to order then they messed up are order charged us for there mess up Questioned the price they gave us a hard time just to get the receipt to prove them wrong That took  another 10 minutes
22890,1,"Be Aware

Always a problem in this branch Either order is wrong or missing key ingredients in burgers like ketchup for example or stale meat ingredients or the high prices or the 45 60 minutes long lines etc What broke the camel back for me was when some customers would skip the drive thru line and when speaking to the McDonalds manager I was told theres nothing they can do about it Very bad area to be in for sure Ghetto employees and ghetto customers Better to drive couple more miles either way on 192 than to come here"
22870,1,Made an order online Arrived 15 later The place was packed We waited 50 minutes in the store for our food We got the wrong nugget sauces We were missing 2 LG fries and 2 LG sweet ts The manager behind the counter was very rude to the customers This place is a wreck

15300,1,Terrible
22872,1,Companies need to understand its not 2020 anymore The public is tired of your excuses Be aware this location starts breakfast at 4am however during late hours they shut their systems down meaning they only take cash and mobile orders are not accepted and the mobile app is not updated to make yiuu aware of this Maybe its legit seems shady though If anything it is poor management It is understandable to shut down system during slower times if need be But you should have it ready to go by time your breakfast hours start and the mobile app should not be accepting orders
4844,1,Bad
22873,1,Automated McDonalds dont expect excellent customer service food is always mediocre
22883,1,Waited 34 minutes to pick up our order and of course it was wrong and cold Poorly managed I do not recommend this location
15292,1,The staff is not very focused on their work
22885,1,I have worked at a McDonalds and I have never seen such disrespect Lack of communication and unprofessional from a manger in my life I had a Uber eats order and called 15 minutes before to make sure that it was able to be picked up and when they answered the phone I asked my question and I got hung up on not once but three times When I arrived and have waited in the line the man taking the orders in the drive through said our Uber order would be ready at the second window When we got there the manger told us no orders for Uber were available When I asked if he could double check he said that we would have to go back in line and that he was busy I understand if there is system issues but I 
22886,1,Couldnt even order I was greeted at the drive thru with were only taking one order at a time there are 2 people in front of you Ill get to you when I can so I thought maybe they were severely understaffed After 20 minutes at the speaker waiting I pulled off without ever being spoken to again to find at least 6 or 7 staff members kind of just hanging out inside surely not moving the drive thru line along
15288,1,I love McDonalds but in this one I have had the worst service of the century
22887,1,"Most unprofessional and rude mcdonalds I have ever been to
I recently went to this Mcdonalds and order 2 quarter pounders with cheese with no ketchup or tomatoes because I have an allergy and a large coke When I got to work Im happy that I checked it before I bite into it because it had both When I called them and spoke to the manager I was asked my name and to come back and they would replace it I couldnt make it back that day because I was at work so I called the next day and left them know my name and I was going to go by and get the replacement and they said that I was ok to pick it up Not even 5 minutes later the manager called me back and told me that I couldnt go pick it back up When I said the manager said it was OK the person that called me back said it was a different manager that I talked to and thistles manager said absolutely not Which it was the same manager Like how unprofessional and rude this mcdonalds was"
4833,1,The cutest staff in all of Manhattan
15373,1,Second time Ive been to this location and the second time was even worse than the first The fries were so soggy the box was getting flimsy from the excess oil I couldnt even eat them The cashier was complaining about having to refund me my milkshake because apparently they didnt have milkshakes My boyfriend ordered a chicken sandwich and the chicken was visibly burnt
15374,1,My McNuggets where burnt after a 45 minute wait and i was told to wait in the speaker i recommend going to 1024 E Anderson Ln
15375,1,This was by far the worst experience Ive had a McDonalds drive through  There were only a few cars in line but I waited 30 minutes to get to the order station and another 15 to get to the window to pay and get my food  I cant imagine what they were doing in there that it took so long
15414,1,Drive thru only  lobby always closed  cant take two orders for one car probably not coming back  
15413,1,Been living next to this McDonalds for almost 2 years EVERYTIME I
4736,1,Two giant women who stay at the early hours refused me service just because the order was large They invented that cards werent working but a customer had recently passed a card Both lazy and aggressive behavior A fat white woman and a black woman At 5 am there are almost no stores open I had to get hungry Never again will I go to this place I dont know how the franchise owner allows this type of employee on site
15411,1,Worst McDonalds stopped to get a Mochiatto and the young lady yeah No hot coffee  Asked for a shake Yeah 
15410,1,Store always seems to operate drive thru only  Main door lock Through lunch hours With management sitting in booth a front door
15409,1,No dining in for over two years although the signage on the door still says theyre open daily The app for ordering straight up sucks and only works maybe 60 of the time Parking lot continuously backed up and blocked from drive thru customers
29824,1,We were inside a Walmart McDonalds My granddaughter has food allergies to egg  dairy So there are only a few things that she can have We had ordered her a kids happy meal with apple slices but they gave us french fries instead The beef frying oil has dairy in it so she can not have the french fries and they were all out of apple slices Next we ordered apple juice They were all out of apple juice as well The girl employee that was trying to help us did not believe me that the french fries had dairy in it A happy meal hamburger and apple slices is all she can have here Was not happy with the service here The food and service times are not the same as it used to be
29815,1,"Disappointing McDonalds is my standby for fast food Normally I get consistent food with decent sometimes amazing service I know its not going to the gourmet but better than waiting at an untested restaurant for more expensive and worse food

Shrinkflation at its best  Half filled fries Soda with no refills Seriously Especially now that a combo meal costs 9

At first I thought it was because the restaurant was newer but after looking at these review"

29832,1,No cashiersorder takers you must use their selfservice kiosk which they have several of You take a number sign to your table and staff will deliver your order to your table however this wasnt the case for us The employee came from around the counter and yelled our number while she stood in the nearly empty lobby We were seated less than 6 feet away from her and in her lineofsight We raised our hand and said thats us She saw us but made no attempt to deliver the food I dont mind getting up and getting the food from her despite the kiosk saying it would be delivered to our table but Im feeling a little like an unpaid employee at this pointwe placed the order ourselves as well as served ourselves the food despite paying the same amount for the food that a fullservice McDonalds charges Several people instore and in drive thru returned food due to being cold old or not made correctly This included usat 100 in the afternoon the nuggets were cold chewy and seemed old I would think this wouldnt be the case given 100 pm is during the lunch rush Fries were cold presumably because they were sitting on the tray well before the rest of the food was ready Double cheeseburger was made correctly no mustard or pickles but bun was not warmdry and cheese was coldnot melted 4 managers were in the kitchen buttonup shirts with ties along with 6 employees yet there was a lot of standing around doing nothing and operating with a shufflepaced leisurelystroll walk I worked at McDonalds and Burger King as a teenager and was always told If you got time to lean youve got time to clean and that was during slowdead times not lunch rush I will say that the manager I returned my double cheeseburger and fries to we ended up just eating our stale nuggets because we were told it was going to be 510 minutes for fresh ones was nice and when I told her she could just microwave my burger she insisted on making a new one
15423,1,They always Getting orders wrong more than 8 times
29830,1,The manager was rude I waited for more than 40 minutes understanding that they were busy  but everyone who wanted to ask her was stressed  The worst customer service additionally tells me that my refund will be from 5 to 10 days since after 45 minutes waiting  It only said that there were many orders

The person who cleans is completely dirty badly dressed and smells bad aside we started to scream for sitting 5 minutes to choose the menu even threatened to call the police we literally ran out of there the moment I went to place my order the cashier treated us very poorly I would not recommend to anyone the worst McDonalds in New York"
15402,1,This is the second time they do this We are there by 1027am and breakfast ends at 1030 and when they ask us what they can help us with we answered with breakfast and they just cut us off and say to give them a minute they come back around 1031am and ask us again what we wanted and we told them we wanted breakfast and they say oh sorry were not serving breakfast anymore we let them know we were there before 1030 and they told us to wait and all they had to say was they werent serving breakfast anymore
4751,1,Unspeakable to avoid as much as possible better to eat pizza for a dollar
15401,1,Waited in drive thru for 15 minutes and had to switch lanes because lady was only taking one side at a time

29795,1,Terrible
15384,1,If I can give this place ZERO stars I would I went through drive through and cashier informed me to wait on line 1 So I drove and parked while I was waiting a lot of vehicles passed through There was an older lady with red hair giving out deliveries of food so I was wondering when my order was going to come out waiting there for 30minutes or Longer So I walked inside asking for my order and come to find out that my order was given to someone else So they had to put my order again through the system so I can get my food so again Now I had to wait for others to come out before mine because my order was last in line Food wasnt warm once I got it and fries had salt when I ordered no salt Never coming to this place again if your near by this location I recommend going to the McDonalds on 183 by Taco Bell
15382,1,Absolutely terrible experience Walked in and ordered our food on the kiosk After about 5 minutes an employee sticks her head out to say no ice cream Three of our 4 items were ice cream products My husband then asks if we could get a refund to which she 
4779,1,People have an attitude that since they dont want to work they just wait for the time to leave
15381,1,Ordered an unsweetened tea The person came out to the pickup area and told me they had none and did I want some other drink I said yes and told her what I would like and it was never brought out to me I ate what I ordered and they never brought it I had to go to work so I just had to leave

4782,1,It was terrible poor attention and with a dirty bathroom that it was impossible to enter
15379,1,We waited 25 min in the drive thru line to be told we had to come inside for our mobile drive thru order The guy in the drive thru insisted we go inside to pick up the order We parked in front I went inside and waited 8 mins to be asked what my order was The cashier said she didnt have a order for my code I was giving her She went over to the drive thru cashier and she told him he needs to process the mobile orders in the drive thru It was causing a delay with several customers
15378,1,Wow this McDonalds Is the worst ran one that Ive been to in Texas Food is consistently delivered wrong Your bag is going to always have a missing item Can we go back in to get your missing items is such a hassle that you just keep on driving home without turning around because its not going to be with your while
15377,1,"What can I say its McDonalds  The food is never cold or smashed Its hit or miss on the type of employee youll get at the drive through They either dont want to be here and hate the fact that youre making them work or they smile and make you feel welcomed Its close to my office for a quick breakfast or lunch

Im editing my last post and changing my rating I waited in the DriveThru for 10 minutes with no one coming on the line The other line however three cars went through while I sat there I pulled forward to place my order at the window and I was told that I had to drive back around The level of unacceptable is insane  I try to be understanding of fast food workers because I know they deal with ugly people but this takes the cake  The day is Monday June 11th 2023 at 345pm The morning crew is a good bunch of workers however the afternoon crew has always been extremely slow"
4786,1,Very dirty and there is no place to sitit has the second floor but it is closed
15376,1,Consistently the SLOOOWEST McDonalds I have ever seen Also their prices are higher than all of the other McDonalds in Austin for some reason To top it off the food is usually cold and they have a hard time even understanding your order
15385,1,"horrible experience just drive for 3 more min to the Anderson lane McDonalds
I got there at 645am and opening time is listed as 5am I was waiting at the drive through speaker for 10 minutes NOBODY even said anything I drive up to the order window and see another car that was there ever since I got here parked waiting for food for forever The payment window was empty I parked and decided to order inside but the door was locked even though they were OPEN the 2 employees inside were just standing there doing nothing they saw me knock and purposefully completely ignored me
Maybe they are understaffed but not an excuse to be so disrespectful to a knocking customer and NOT even put up some kind of sign or open the door to a knocking customer to let them know whats going on There were other cars behind me that were just waiting for a 5am opening McDonalds to kindly start working after 7am

23083,1,This location has slow service and horrible customer service  The computer order machine was not working  instead of informing custmers they said nothing Orders were backed up and the staff acted like nothing was wrong What kind of training is McDonalds giving their employees  For such a big business  and being involved in so many charities you think  they would emphasize excellent customer service McDonalds you are slipping
15056,1,What can I say Its fast food
23084,1,This McDonalds was the worst i haver ever been in  ZERO STARS Floor in entrance was flooded Bathrooms disgusting Soda bar dirty and filthy with no ice Garbage cans over flowing 12 to 15 people inside with one person working the register This after sitting in drive through fir 5 to 8 minutes without moving
23085,1,What is the point in having employees in a store if they dont help you The employees talking to each other and when you want to place an order they tell you to place it on the machine The store was empty What are they there for if the machine is going to take your order They are getting paid to chit chat Bad customer service
23088,1,Thought it would be a standard mcds however after placing our order and putting the table number for the meal to be delivered to us it wasnt We went to counter to find part of the order sitting there then we were given the order with a lot of items missing

23040,1,Extremely rude and impatient I asked for 3 water cups with my 40 meal and I got a glare and only one cup  Then my brother who ordered a 20 piece nugget went up to ask for sauce because they didnt include any that we asked for after waiting patiently and then asking several times he got 2 of the 4 he asked for  He came back frustrated with only 2 so I told him to go back for more He asked the manager 4 times to her face very nicely for 2 more and she just looked at him each time and went the other way Eventually a kind fellow customer next to him reached over the counter and just took sauce for my brother Not impressed
23041,1,Double check your orders I got someone else order and when i took it back The employee placed it back to give it to someone else I told her I touched the burger to throw it away She looked at my face and lie that she threw it away Horrible attitude from the cashier Order was not completed
23043,1,Long line at kisok which was only way to order due to lack of staff Difficulty using my coupon since ordered from kiosk Tea was weak had been sitting awhile Terrible experience

23049,1,they took forever and it was hardly busy i asked if my order was ready after waiting for like 20 minutes and was told no just to be handed my order less than a minute after it was sitting there the whole time and the female working the register was disrespectful for no reason
23056,1,"Showed up 20 minutes before the menu change and was told I couldnt order what I wanted off of the advertised menu When I question that to the employee they basically said they were too underpaid and lazy to make me chicken nuggets and all I could have was the two mcChicken sandwiches they had left Or nothing

Great customer service NOT"
15086,1,Thru dont listen
23057,1,If it were possible to leave 0 stars I would Absolutely zero customer service The only interaction with both guys at the drive thru was when the order was placed neither of them spoke a word in person The guy at the payment window was too busy talking with the guy who would be the person to push the food out of the window and he couldnt be bothered to tell us which of the 2 pick up windows to stop at I would say that the behavior could have been excused if they were busy but they werent at all Yet even being busy doesnt excuse the gross lack of basic human interaction
23059,1,"As usual the food prep people dont know how to read a order slip Big mac no sauce no cheese
What did I get Big Mac cheese ONLY on it

29517,1,Terrible
23092,1,If you like to sit in the pick up line for 20 minutes and when you finally get your food it is not at all what you ordered then this is the place for you
23113,1,"Just went and got 4 McChicken 1 Large French fry a medium one and a cheeseburger

5058,1,Terrible
23119,1,I guess when youre in a tourist area you dont have to worry about pleasing your local customers for return business Stale burger buns cold and burnt french fries  Medium fries box was about 23 full  Drive thru employee didnt say two words to me beyond the price of my meal
15002,1,Apple pies are horriblego back to the old kind please
23122,1,I went through the drivethru at this location and ordered a big Mac a large fry two McDoubles as well as a medium caramel frappe however when I return to my room the big Mac was missing as well as the cookies so I drove back up to the location Ive now been sitting here over 20 minutes and nobody has come outside to let me know what was going on I would highly recommend finding another McDonalds to go to seeing as they dont seem to care about their customers
23124,1,The worst McDonalds Ive been to Went in around 10 maybe 11 at night after visiting disney on the way back to our hotel Went inside because the drive through line had at least 10 cars no big deal I was ordering a carryout Anyways they forgot the chicken nuggets for the 10 piece chicken nugget meal I wasnt about to bring my two little ones back out so I called the store I told them what had happend and said I would be back sometime tomorrow afternoon and to just get it then my boys love McDonalds she said that would be fine and she would be there the next day I asked her name but it couldnt really understand what she said because she was talking fast Anyways I go back the day and told the lady at the drive through what happend she didnt know what to do and had to get a manager the manager comes on and asks who I spoke to and I told her I didnt remember but she said to bring my receipt in and she would take care of it Manager didnt believe me I ended up just buying another one and I know its literally only a few dollars but it was the principal
23112,1,"I have been staying at the Holiday Inn next door to the McDonalds for four days now Every morning we walk over to McDonalds to get bacon egg and cheese biscuits and hash browns EVERY SINGLE MORNING that weve went over there we have gotten hard rubbery cold biscuits Their hash browns are hard as well and there is so much grease that it runs down your fingers when you pick it up

I called the manager and she was very polite and replaced my breakfast with better biscuits However the replacement biscuits were undercooked They were very doughy I do not recommend this place to anyone The convenience to the hotel is not worth the terrible food"
23125,1,Quarter pound CB although made correctly with no onions was raw in the middle not noticed until my husband was already almost done eating then he just threw it away hopefully he does not get sick Kids meal CB ordered with no onions not rang up that way was covered in onions Lessons here cook outs not being done to make sure on quality  not serving raw product  cashier needs a little more trainingbecause when I ordered my CB kids meal with no onions  a Large diet cook as the drink He did not put on there the no onions  then asked me what did I want to drink
14993,1,App never works here and the customer service is non existent
23130,1,If I could give it NO STARS I would  We waited MORE then 20 mins inside for our breakfast  Ok I can see if you are that busy  need to make the foodafter 30 minutes we got cold food  the hashbrowns were so dripping in grease and colddisgusting
23134,1,Morons running the restaurant The 6 meal is a rip off We asked if we could get the same deal but sub a side salad They said yes then they over charged us and yold us oh no substitutions Watch your tickets and repeat your order three times so the cashier and shift supervisor understand what you actually want
14989,1,The food wasnt fresh and over cooked
23135,1,1st night in Orlando in vacation Drive thru was packed so we went inside Waited for 10 minutes and manager said lobby was now closed and we had to leave
23137,1,The girl who takes the payments is SO RUDE If you hate your job look for something else or at least treat people nice
23126,1,Its really ridiculous that Im coming every day for my breakfast at this branch and they dont care about customer satisfied every morning I ordered 2 hot coffe and they gave me cold one Again and again it happened
15012,1,This place needs a deep cleaning
23108,1,Seems like the more one goes to this locationthe worse it getstoasting an English muffin should not be a difficult task it wouldnt be badbut lying about toasting it Shame on themapparently after a certain hour it isnot a priority to make decent food for the publicor decent friesnot to mention a double cheeseburger simply gross Good griefthis place is certainly disappearing from my list of quick stopsto keep going by  cause Checkers is right down the road

23095,1,Food was decent until I found a tooth pick in my fries  unfortunately there wasnt anything I can do or say since I was just passing through on vacation from Chicago
23097,1,Spent 15 minutes in the drivethru  most of which was sitting at the window waiting for my food Didnt get a straw my double cheeseburger had no cheese and my sons happy meal had no toy All I ordered was a a double cheese meal and a happy meal and you couldnt get either one right even after a 15 minute wait Completely unacceptable
15034,1,They forgot my chicken fingers damn
15033,1,Slow slow slow 12hr in the drive thru
15032,1,Fries on point everything else cooked in microwave
29505,1,Terrible

15026,1,Need better customer service
23099,1,If I could rate a 0 I would I didnt even get my order because I had to wait so long What fast food experience EVER
23103,1,The staff here is not friendly at all Where I grew up you greet somebody or at least say something The drinks tasted horrible
23104,1,Absolutely Terrible Food  No OPTIONS for Anything even remotely Healthy  The staff is polite  but McDonalds You WILL continue to lose business  People are finally looking at All the disgusting ingredients thats in the production of your food Even the yogurt has MORE SUGAR THAN A SUNDAY  I wouldnt even recommend the fries  Unless you want a Heart attack  with  a side of High blood pressure and Diabetes with a POSSIBLY of cancer then okay go for it 
23091,1,Got the order wrong Went back They told me to pull up 2nd window  They forgot me Then got the order wrong again
15115,1,Very slow with service
23037,1,Unnecessary long wait time in drive thru Drive thru is built for double cars and double pick up windows but still stayed behind 4 cars for 30 minutes Only waited due to long drive home with kids in the car Rude staff as well Really wish I had noticed the Burger King across the street earlier I would have even settled for checkers across the street and thats saying a lot because I dont think anyone willingly eats at checkers
23034,1,Busy under staffed slow service condiment stand a mess out of lids ketchup dispenser broken  I ordered to eat in and my food was delivered to my table in a to go bag  Why take a number and have an associate bring a to go bag to the table  Very  very illrun and poorly  managed location  Just  awful
29635,1,Terrible
15219,1,Not a good McDonalds
22949,1,They wont take my order I had to use the self serving one n they didnt take our food to the table as the number thingy said
22951,1,Manager was the absolute worst The talent pool must be real slim They need to seek management with some sorta personality
22954,1,My quarter pounder with cheese was old cold and dry
22961,1,No contact with the workers till they delivered  Basically you were ignored unless you yelled loudly for attention  Very disappointed and will never visit there again Remover the kiosk in order to give a one on one personal touch  Even a good morning GO BACK TO COUNTER HELP PLEASE
22948,1,"24 hours its a joke right
I arrived from my trip at 300am today 022622 and the cashier notified me to wait
After 30 minutes without attending to me in the selfservice line I decided to check if there was someone to attend me and nobody came out or said anything  It is a lack of respect"
22964,1,There were people inside but they were closed but they did sell food only that I could not buy because I did not have a car If they are open for take away they should not DISCRIMINATE someone because he does not have a car
22967,1,Worst McDonalds I have ever been to The food was dry we had to ask for our drinks three times and we had to ask for the Happy Meal toy There was one helpful young woman working front cash who got the last drink sorted out But wont be back unless management starts checking in and doing a better job motivating employees
22969,1,I just want to warn people that they have a beautiful playground that you can see from the outsidebut its closed 
22970,1,"Terrible 1st no cashier they force us to use the non user friendly kiosk
2nd why ask us to take a table number if you dont deliver the food
3rd 6 dirty tables
Dont you forget they are many other fast food options"
22975,1,Worst ever spent 45 minutes in line and then they never took my order through the intercom finally made it to the front they took forever to give me my order then get home to see a combo missing UGH then I call to complain and they never answered the phone Horrible management
22976,1,I sat in drive through Tuesday night around 1130 PM for 20 minutes and pull up to order and associate says sorry we are closed I explained to him that I had been waiting already for over 20 minutes and he mumbled something and said sorry the website says open 24hrs
22978,1,It is unfortunate what I experienced in that place A man entered in his wheelchair just to charge his chair battery to continue on his way  and the manager of that store took him out of the place it was inhumane what she did with that poor person
22965,1,Drive thru is the biggest mistake  They Assured me everything was in the bag  And nope no 20 piece chicken nuggets 
22946,1,Self ordering stations inside offer a milk alternative for coffee and thats what we thought we got Went through the drive through to be told they dont offer such a thing My husband was in the middle of explaining the situation to the manager at the window when she just turned and walked away My husband had to get her attention to finish explaining that the menu inside has it on there She was slightly aggressive  we left
22945,1,Just went to this location Worst service I ever had I was unable to process my orden with the Kiosk After I couldnt make the order I was standing at the line and the employee said all orders needed to be thru the Kiosk I told them I tried it and was unable to complete the order and I prefer wanted to do it thru cashier Manager Jennifer was rude and said that if I wanted to do it with a cashier I had to do it via drive thru To be honest that is totally disrespectful and unprofessional Where is the customer service or Customer Service satisfaction You can not force your customers to do only kiosk What about people that cant read Are they not allowed to go inside the restaurant just because they cant make the order at the kiosk
15227,1,This is a horrible mcdMcDonal
15246,1,Poor Service
22924,1,"Dont eat here Order is always wrong takes forever fries are cold and gross Dining room closes at 11pm NOPE Really closes at like 8pm Update the hours on your door When we knocked on the door and pointed to the sign THE MANAGER FLIPPED US OFF

Cooperate needs to fire most the staff all the managers and get new people in there"
22925,1,DO NOT GO HERE  This was the most unprofessional treatment that we ever received by McDonalds We felt like we couldnt even report it because we didnt have a name to call up the next day and speak to a manager he wouldnt even give us a name
22928,1,Have to order by computer and no one to help Asked for no mustard and crispy fries  Had 6 workers talking about a ring instead of just looking at me as I asked for help Bathroom are nasty  Wont go back again
22932,1,The drive through guy was super disrespectful and awful to deal with We had ordered online and they said it didnt go through even though it charged us so instead of providing a solution he stood staring not saying anything As well as when we got the food and asked if that was all and he rolled his eyes and said nothing Absolutely one of the worst experiences in a drive through 0
4892,1,Bad
22936,1,Lines longer than Disney Staff walk around clueless half the time Not sure if understaffed or undertrained Corporate needs to come and take a look at this one or shut it down Been this way for years now Always the same Always cash only at night
22937,1,Was visiting for a few weeks Got coffee plenty of times and was correct maybe twice to three times
4897,1,Bad
15232,1,Horrible
29648,1,Terrible
22941,1,This is the worst experience Ive ever had at a McDonalds Waited in line for over 40 mins at the drive thru then found out my filetofish I ordered was automatically removed from the mobi
29645,1,Terrible
22942,1,I ordered cookies and chocolate chip then I went to pay The cashier was very rude he didnt greet me didnt look me in the eye and just announced  the price with no manners such as please The lady at the drive through just shoved the bag at us no eye contact either Training for the workers at this Mcdonalds is lacking
15229,1,Really slow
22982,1,Hey we just left this place Had a big order  lots of people hungry after getting to town late Among other things we ordered 3 orders of 20 nuggets 4 large fries a bunch of dbl cheeseburgers and a quarter pounder Know what we got A drink we didnt order an apple pie we didnt order an ice cream we didnt order and one 10 piece nugget In a big bag that looked enough like one that would hold our order  our bad I guess but our not checking closely enough just doesnt excuse just not getting 40  worth of food And then they dont answer when we try to call Absolutely terrible store
22985,1,The people in this place could not get any more Dumber Made it a point to order by the number on the menu board and they still are able to screw that up Super great place to visit if your intention is to go through the drivethru then have to park and go inside and fix your order each time
22989,1,They were very rude and food was cold They refuse to let us inside and made us wait 10 mins for three sandwiches and when it was time to get the food two people were VERY RUDE Next time Im in town Ill never go to this McDonalds They were slow rude and not friendly
15177,1,Unprofessional stuff
23019,1,I placed my order at 733pm tonight and got the order at about 815pm  I had to call to make sure they received my order Apparently they either forgot or overlooked it  Usually they would throw in a free item to make you happy   not this place
23020,1,This was the worst McDonalds Ive been in We ordered using the kiosk and  they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your food We waited 20 minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any courtesy The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my husbands drink He went to the counter to get it and they didnt believe him at first My coffee had the label on it for what Id ordered but it didnt have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred it took a sip and got a mouthful of grounds The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and  the coffee was tepid I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was delivered Usually when I get this meal things are quite hot The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off McDonalds for a while The staff didnt seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the McDonalds website and we left
4960,1,Bad
29596,1,Terrible
29595,1,Terrible
23021,1,I placed an order about an hour ago only to find out that half of my order was missing I called this location to let them know that I was missing half my order The manager Judith stated that if I dont come before 4am them Id have to wait until the next day to receive my order Although I do understand that their menu items are schedule based I think its highly unprofessional to turn their problem into mine I understand that my items were not available after that time but she was extremely unhelpful in finding a solution to the problem they created I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager is on vacation The call ended with her stating that she does not have time to deal with my problem because they are too busy
23022,1,"I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular McDonalds to in the past
This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney parks but still close enough to get back to the parks quickly At that time it was worth it The menu was cheap or at least what you know to expect from a international chain and since its a chain you know what the food is gong to be like
So lets look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of restaurants You need to set yourself apart with your service This WAS the reason I used to recommend this restaurant Sadly I dont think they care anymore The last time we went half of the kiosks werent working One of the three that was didnt print receipts This plays a part into why the service was so atrocious Actually there was a lot that played into it Now if youve gone to McDonalds at all recently you know you pick your food at the kiosk get a number that you take to your table pay at the kiosk sit down and wait for your food Typically all of that takes about five minutes Well this day and what Ive garnered from tourists and locals on many other days the team at work decided they werent going to bring the food to the table That would have been fine if there was any indication ANYWHERE but of course that would have been a form of service so that didnt happen After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together only a slight exaggeration we were told by other customers that were leaving that they werent calling numbers and you had to wait at the counters
Ok So I go up to the counter and wait We get our food 40 minutes later and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get corrected No big deal we are used to this
My inlaws are visiting and at this point Im trying to figure why they havent received their order It dawned on me  that my father inlaw doesnt have a receipt remember the machine that wasnt printing receipts
The person calling numbers is calling the number on the receipt not the tent number Apparently my inlaws food was ready in a master of minutes amazing since that is all customized and placed in the abandoned order area If we hadnt said anything they would never have received their food The lady never once called a tent number We told another person of the lack of receipt problem That information never got transmitted to the person calling the numbers When we spoke with her and told her their was no receipt she asked us what the receipt number was We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream machine and she asked again for the receipt
Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to do the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local dump Im not sure if they just didnt staff well on this shift but like I said Ive talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a while"
23023,1,Hands down the worst McDonalds Ive ever experienced Rudest employees Lady in drivethru looked like a manager and was infuriatingly rude and just a horrible person The young girl at the register refused to acknowledge me turned her head and walked right by as I tried to ask for help Other people ordered ate and finished there food while I stood there unacknowledged for over 10 minutes waiting for 2 double cheeseburgers and a fry A guy was just leaning on the counter doing nothing and walked away when I said I could not wait any longer Never got my money back a
23025,1,"Really slow service took over 15 minutes to receive the food  after it had been delivered to another table

When it did arrive the chicken and burger were cold Duly sent back to be fair they were remade and brought pretty quick but no apology"
15131,1,Horrible service and management
23026,1,Take the extra 5 minutes to go to a different location My entire order was incorrect and stuffed into one bag which broke 2 seconds after it was handed to me The person who took my order was more interested in rushing me then looking to see if it was correct Went inside to speak with a manger and turns out she was the one who bagged my order I then got screamed at by some young wanna be Rico suave who shouldve been in the kitche
15127,1,Dont like mcd
4974,1,Bad
23032,1,Ridiculous i am not one to ridicule this is pure ridiculousness I should not have to check behind people that are begging for higher wages and they cant even get a kids meal right you forgot the nuggets and I also ordered fries and apples I received  double fries  no nuggets as well as missing the sauces that were to accompany the nuggets I tried calling when I arrived back No one answered the phone Here is your negative review that couldve been rectified with you answering the phone to address these issues
23033,1,Slowest McDonalds I have ever been to in my life Took an hour just to order in drive thru Then took another 20 minutes just to get our food orders 2 burgers apple pie and 20pc nugget so shouldnt have taken to long at all
23016,1,Im sorry to give only one star But during our visit were in the childrens area 7 of 7 tables or seats are not clean It was uncomfortable for me to sit there There were many spots to see unappetizing if the area for the guests looks like how is it in the kitchen I do not want to imagine it I will not go there a second time
15251,1,Horrible
23015,1,Service was terrible wouldnt allowed to use the app couldnt redeem point wouldnt let us use gift card I think they were pocketing the cash they overcharged us and forgot Burger
29605,1,Terrible
22993,1,Food was cold Cheese wasnt melted on burger Is that all is that all is that all is that all after every item u order I will tell thats all when Im done ordering Wow customer service is really bad everywhere these days
22995,1,Very bad so gross  didnt do clean up 
4936,1,Boooooooo
15165,1,No more sales
23000,1,Terrible customer serviceordered from the kiosk was the only person waiting at the counter and not one person acknowledged me To make matters worse the manager was assisting in fulfilling orders instead of delegating her employees While they stood and had conversation I waited 15 min before I received a Did you order Not even the management acknowledged mecant expect good service if the management doesnt know how to give it
15161,1,Just not good
23003,1,They never seems to get our order right  Thank God we always check our food and for some reason I always have to go inside and they get in an attitude So we will not be returning nor recommending to any of our friends or family
23008,1,I had the worst experience at this location I went to the drive thru and only ordered 2 hamburgers and a small fry I paid and pulled up to get my food and was given the wrong order I let the associate know it wasnt correct He had me pull up to the wait window to get my correct food As I sat and waited time was just ticking by After 15 minutes of patiently waiting I wanted my food No one came back I knocked on the glass and no response As about the 10th car received there food at the window behind me I had to get out of the car and walk back to that window as it was late and the inside was closed I asked where my food was and he said he was making it I asked for a refund and was given my slip refund a total of 28 minutes after first paying I went back in the next day to speak with a manager to let them know that this happened I had my receipt with the time and the refund receipt with the time 28 minutes later He said oh Im sorry theyre new Terrible customer service and uncaring management
23009,1,Service was trash took them 20 minutes to take my order no exaggerations Seriously cant even salt fries for some reason and the employees werent able to organize correctly For example at one point there were three employees gathered around to fill one order ONE ORDER Seriously Id recommend going somewhere else then to spend your time and money here
29613,1,Terrible
15153,1,Missing food and drinks 
29611,1,Terrible
29610,1,Terrible
23011,1,Worst MCdonalds experience ever 40 minutes and counting and no order Dont ever stop here unless you want to get extremely mad
4950,1,Bad
15144,1,Wasnt open on time
22818,1,This is the most Discusting McDonald I
15425,1,I asked for 5 sausage McGriddles 6 and some other items I got 6 sausage and biscuits oh and my 4 hashbrowns was soaked is grease 2nd time within weeks there will not be a 3rd
29835,1,horrific service this is NOT the worlds largest McDonalds as people are reviewing on here this is the location on international Dr near the OCCC ordering at the drive thru took almost 20 minutes this did not include waiting for the food the man speaking kept whispering and getting an attitude despite us saying we could not hear him did not correctly take our order would just not say anything for multiple minutes at a time i have never in my life been to a McDonalds with worse service avoid at all costs
15535,1,"Usually I dont have time to eat at McDonalds So I take food togo This is not the first time that I order something and I get something These people always miss something from the order and since its togo I cant even go back and tell them It happened like 56th so far Very poor service from this McD

Hopefully they read this and do something about it"
15534,1,"Talk about HORRIBLE SERVICE this is by far the worse place to try to go at any time of the day you have nothing but RUDE EMPLOYEES Definitely a lesson learned I have had quite a few BAD EXPERIENCES going to this mcdonals NEVER AGAIN I rather drive an extra 1015 minutes and take my money and my business somewhere else
If I could give this review a 0 start I would
I AM HIGHLY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS PLACE"
15533,1,"I been looking forward to visiting a high tech Macdonald and to my surprised was the dirtiest Macdonalds I been in Bathrooms were filthy and the main dinning area needs a thorough cleanup Seen third world countries Macdonald and always been spotless

I would not record this location I mentioned it to an employee and she mumble as she walk away"
29999,1,Easily the worst fast food experience My girlfriend and I were feeling sick from needing to eat something and stopped here Location is 24hr but the doors were locked to stop ppl coming in A customer let us in and we were greeted to customers demanding refunds ridiculous wait times and them being out of many items Staff is very rude and condescending and the place is very poorly managed
29998,1,Ordered using their self serve machines Sat at the table as per the instructions on the machine Waited 15 minutes No food Politely asked the manager behind the counter and they had missed our order and thought it had been prepared No apology just a rude manager telling us to sit down and it will be be brought to us
29997,1,For me to give them a start is too much I went several time there and the foot is awful the chicken nuggetthe cold and old and I asked the lady the next time I went around if she can please make sure that the nuggets are fresh She reply fresh you want them fresh And I replied please Do I pay at the window pick up my order the one I drove away I grabbed one of the nuggets and that look and feel like they were sitting since the next day I have to throw my food away never again
30004,1,Dirty store waited 45 minutes for our food and never received it We left I would like my 30 back No origination worst McDonalds Ive ever been to
29996,1,Extremely unreliable Not enough staff to run the store Sometimes no drive thru sometimes OBLY drive thru This is stupid considering theres more people
15530,1,Sign says lobby open till 11pm and the doors locked at 10 pm Called to ask manager about descrency of hours of operation and was not satisfied with response from manager and when i asked for corporate or complaint number she responded why did i need the number  Really For being new in this area extremely dissappointed  Terrible customer service horrible quality and have had complications at this location 290 at tuscany austin tx
4502,1,Restrooms out of service and terrible guy at the pick up post
29994,1,They will NOT TAKE YOUR ORDER inside UNLESS you use their self serve kiosk I shouldnt have to say I cannot see the screen for someone to take an order Why have the front counter if its self checkout at ALL times It is not busy I just left and went to get food from someone else Why is that the only way to order I work and live near here but will definitely not be back nor my coworkers
29992,1,Honestly has to be the most useless people in this place ordered twice via Uber eats and both orders was wrong so tonights orders here goes missing 2 fries and a Big Mac come on how stupid can these people be if I was the boss I would send them all home I will be emailing McDonald
4505,1,Mc  McDonald never   Answers my calls  and questions
15529,1,this is the absolute worst customer service Ive ever experienced I was at the drivethru for at least 3 minutes and nobody ever responded on the intercom box and then when I pulled up to the window the lady said it was working that they just didnt take my order
15532,1,Terrible  customer service Besides having to wait in line at the drive thru for over 10 mins to get 1 coffee was pathetic Then it never fails the employee at the window that hands your food thru drive thru never is even courteous or says a simple HELLO or Here your food I hate service like that And it hasnt just been this one time its always that way
4488,1,I got 34 nuggets in my order 
4487,1,Restroom out of service No reason They dont want us to use it
15539,1,Probably the worst McDondalds I have visited on a regular basis in my life Rude employees that dont care and something is ALWAYS wrong with my order  And for some reason the debit card reader is always down
15547,1,Sick of the long wait Every single time I come here its the same woman running the register 10 minutes to order food 10 minutes to get my food Get a crew that actually works Or get an ow we that actually values CUSTOMER SERVICE

22794,1,I do not understand how the male supervisor with green locs who is working right now still has a job This is the second time I came to me and my children were mistreated at this location Even writing this trying to remain professional is extremely hard I went through the drive through on each occasion He was rolling his eyes condescending disrespectful disregarded my concern slammed and locked the windows while I was talking I walk inside to get an upper management personnel and her name was Roseline When I asked her if she was above the side in the picture she threw her arm out and said what happened She walked away and disregarded my concern There was a African guy with a coat on in the food are passed me the sauce and told me it was not his job to do so this loca
15545,1,Well where do I start 1 Lack of Supervision always good to see our youth learning to be in the work force but more playing and joking around than waiting on the customer  2 most McDonalds fries are the Bomb not here there over Cooked along with everything else 3 place always empty napkins  straws ice 4 place is Filthy unless you get there early in the morning  Good Luck if you go there
15544,1,This McDonalds is consistently out of coffee  I have gone there several times in the morning and they are out  Personally I have always liked McDonalds coffee it is too bad this franchise cannot provide it
15543,1,I wish I could give 0 starsmy order was completely wrong I had no eggs  my biscuits were literally burnt the coffee was disgusting and when you try to call the phone is off the hook and just goes busy when you call They even repeated my order back to me and it was correct on the receipt but I did not rcv what was listed

30005,1,Do not eat here save yourself time and money I ordered here 5 times in a month and every time it was wrong you would think I would learn I tried to make it easy on them and ordered my burgers plain Thinking the less work the better Nope some how plain means ketchup only Another time they put tartar sauce on my cheese burger The managers tell you if you have a problem to just call the McDs number to complain I am local so I have choices to eat at other places You know what Wendys is sounding a lot better these days Its not even a short staff problem its a I dont care problem I must be a slow learner but trust me this McD ruined it for all others losing my 45 order each trip wont hurt then in the short term But over a long time it will and will make sure I let others know to for go McD and go somewhere else STAY AWAY
29991,1,Massively understaffed 25 min wait for food Also got the order wrong Corporate needs to sack up and pay their people more because the world is on fire inflation is rampant and end times are near Also every fat miserable Disneygoing family youd never want to run into frequents this place Avoid at all costs
15550,1,I went through the DriveThur everyone was on there phones which is beyond discussing when youre dealing with food Before I could even get t

29980,1,Absolutely horrible place After waiting 40 minutes we had to ask how much longer The first lady looked at the orders then ignored me The manager finally came and couldnt even find my order The workers were just yelling over each other and at costumers Never got all our food and was upset with this place we just had to leave Will never go back and we frequently are in Orlando
29979,1,"Zero starts
All tables were unattended They were all dirty Food took a while Manager was yelling at staff to hurry up with food I stood for a few minutes ready to place my order I was the next client No one I mean Not a soul greeted me acknowledge my presence or anything Not even an exchange of words when I got my food which I had to order online from inside the restaurant because no one was there to help me Not a youre welcome when I said thanks Nothing I would not come here again"
15517,1,Everytime I go here they seem to have an issue with charging for ranch Today a told them at the speaker box twice I wanted a total of 3 ranch Which honestly I could use five or six When I got to the second window I only found one It was a manger serving me I explained to her that I asked for a total of 3 ranches She hands me 1 and proceeds to tell me I was not charged for it Annoyed I grab the change and explained to her I ask for extra everytime and it ends up like this At this point the manager quickly grabbed 2 more and rushed me off I understand I was not charge I am willing to pay the extra dollar or 2 for extra Please dont be rude to me cause I like enough sauce for my nuggets
15516,1,Breafast burritos tortillas are always hard and eggs are dried out when I go late in the morning  So I ask for extra cheese Cashier says they cannot do that because they are already made I tell her make me 2 fresh ones She says she has to go see  Comes back and says no  I order something elsr and aak for fries It is only 1015 and we cant make fries until 1030  I can get hash browns at 300 pm but cant get fries until after 1030 Makes no sense I ask for manager She says I am the manager  Really Then why did you have to go ask about the cheese  Do you always ASK your emoyees if tthey can put cheese on sonething  So now she not only gives bad servicebut LIES to me about being manager  I want call from OWNER
29978,1,With the size of the big breakfast that would starve a child Maybe you should start calling it baby breakfast If you dont get cakes with it then you have over half a tray of just a bite of eggs two small strips of bacon and a dryhard biscuit I think a total of six bites and two minutes with phone in hand while eating and it was gone There goes almost ten bucks
4538,1,"Badhard buiscuts
Nasty"
4532,1,Should not be rated this highly for breakfast
29977,1,rude customers half the kiosk malfunction and staff is not trained to help if it malfunctions Managers are so busy solving issues with equipment they cant manage the staff High turnover homeless people camping out inside Overall way to crowded and overpriced travel the extra mile and go to the next McDonald
15515,1,This McDonalds is getting this rating not cause its McDonalds but because time after time it has been terribly poor service I have had one experience where a manager told me that I was wrong That clearly I ordered wrong All I asked for was a double quarter pounder with cheese meal They took down a quarter pounder with cheese meal because thats likely more common than what I ordered And instead of admitting they may have messed up she told me I was wrong and needed to just accept that I have been told that they only carry 2 types of sauce for nuggets as well which I believe isnt true I believe they just didnt know the other ones and didnt want to find out I have also had large fries consistently only filled about 34s of the way Never once have I had a full large fries from there
29974,1,2530 min wait for food and order wasnt even correct Other people told me theyd waited an hour Also some of the most unhappy themeparkbound families youre ever going to see in this place Overall a disaster consider starving instead
29973,1,I walked in the door with my son inlaw to order inside because it said dining room open till 3am  It was 1am 3222022  We went to every kiosk none working  We walked up to register  A woman back towards the back yelled out that they were closed   Well we walked out got in our van pulled up to drive through    Nobody responded  We turned off engine a waited a bit  Nobody  We left and visited Wendys drive thru
15514,1,Went to this location this morning around 430am tried to order at drive thru was told I had to come in once I went in cash registers didnt work  they would only except cash which is not unusual because Ive come to this location several times during the AM hours  they will only except cash seems like all the time but after I FINALLY got my order this morning was pissed to find that my hash brown was hard as a rock WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS LOCATION EVER AGAIN
4545,1,Food was grease and cold
4546,1,The counter was unfriendly and unwelcome 
29976,1,Literally waited 20 minutes The sign says to place tent on table and relax Your delicious food is on its way but it wasnt even delivered to us
29981,1,Dinning room was closed at 11 PM Hours on the door say 5 AM to 3 AM There were many employees inside but they only served drivethru and refused to open dinning room
29982,1,What an awful place Unless I am desperate I will never return here
15518,1,The place sucked The manager forced us to used the self order kiosk which I hate using If I have to take my own order give me an employee discount Then a girl behind the counter told me their coffee machine was down then offered me a cup of regular coffee Im place of the McCafe I ordered for 4 Then I ordered 2 apple pies and found cherry pies in the apple pie box I was the told they only had 1 apple pie left Instead of offering a refund I was asked if I wanted one I was given the incorrect amount back for my refund  It was the worst Mcspirience I ever had
29989,1,worst service i
15525,1,Every time I go to this McDonalds my order is always missing something 
29988,1,I really dont want to be that guy and I typically do not leave bad reviews But this experience this morning was absolutely HORRIBLE I waited 24 min for apple pies that I know for a fact do not take that long to cook Restaurant looked to be short staffed which I understand and there was an employee there that was fairly new it seemed which was also fine My issue came with the TWO managers that were taking care of the guests Zero communication to anyone about what the wait was about I deduced that I was waiting for pies because I heard the crew talking about it These 2 managers were more concerned about what they were doing later and how one typically doesnt work weekends Did not Apologize or attempt to communicate anything to any guests The worse part is as the food finally came up they tossed my bag to me and walked away I hop that this is not typically how business is done there but my goodness
15524,1,I guess my expectations should be low Inside smelled like T somehow Management and staff were having loud personal conversations that included cuss words Talking about how they were so ready to go home cant deal with this bs Among other things One manager was on her phone while tending to fries Cashier was soft spoken and rude or clueless Gnats flew around my food as I ate I was given my ice by the cashier from a bucket behind the register There were no ketchup or napkins out for self serve so when I asked for them they were thrown on my tray It is McDongles after all
29987,1,45 mins on a Thursday night  Nothing makes sense anymore with everything being terrible and no sense of urgency in any aspect of this place  Fire the whole crew from the manager on down and start over
22796,1,Food was fine But when we came a large family were at the cash taking kiosks so we used a regular kiosk and waited to pay cash at the register When the manager came to take cash they gave a look like we were crazy then said you you know we have a cash kiosk to which I responded that people are at it It wasnt overly rude but execution was totally annoyed at us the customer Hope its not like that next time we visit
29986,1,All our burgers were not cooked
4521,1,Not open
29985,1,Worst service ever waited at the counter 20 mins manager said be would be right there currently still waiting while review like dam can I get my Mcflurry Manager seen in photo 
22799,1,"Drive through experience Long line no problem tourist area Took a while to take my order When I paid the person didnt even make eye contact he gave me my receipt without saying a word except for the total and shut the window Then went to the 2nd window where the guy gave me the water bottle and sent me to the 3rd window By the time I paid at 1002 pm it was 1020 pm and I was still waiting on anyone to come to the 3rd window Then a female employee brought me a kids meals and when I asked her for the rest of the order she waved her hand and said I dont know with an attitude She left and I waited 5 more mins before anyone came to the window A male manager came and I explained what was missing plus to look at the happy meal that only had 4 fries cold nuggets no toy no sauce no napkins When I showed the kids meal he said what happened to the fries as if we ate them I looked at him and said thats what you guys gave me and to look at the camera He then said hold on and slammed the window Another 5 mins go by gave me the food and I asked where is the sauce and he said the 1st bag but it wasnt there As he was getting me the sauce I told him this was the worst service ever and that I was going to put a review He shrugged his shoulders slammed the window and left I then proceeded to hunk my horn very loudly to see if he came back to the window but he never did
Im a store manager myself and I would never tolerate a behavior like that from any of my managers or from any of my team members My 6 year old granddaughter was in the car and was crying with this upsetting situation
I visit this location at least 34 times a week never had problems like this with the other shifts"
29984,1,"Well i have never ever been eye rolled on a drive through before but i guess theres always a first time for everything we order shakes the lady gave us spoons and we asked for straws she got offended by this and eye rolled us
Training
Training
Training please to these people on dealing with customers"
4525,1,Dirty and cheap like all McDonalds
15520,1,Bad customer service drive thru wont even listen to ya told them I had coupon on my phone said yes and then charged me full price  Inside is ghetto not very good hiring staff obviously I was there when they had to call the police on one of the employees who was sitting there yelling slurs inside This place sucks overall crappy food anyways eat somewhere healthier and classier with better customer service I suggest a
29983,1,"I placed an order through the improved kiosk system and over 15 minutes later had to inquire about it Turns out the order had been completed but staff were busy with other dutys so it just sat there So much for customer service However the shift leader did apologize Honestly Id rather have hot food And once in my vehicle I discovered the order was not even correct Failure level  complete
My first time in a McDonalds in almost 10 years Now I remember why Given the choice I have no need to return to McDonalds ever"
15519,1,Was told to wait on the side of the building which is typical when long lines form in the drive thru These guys didnt have the courtesy to bring me my food I had to wait outside in the heat for 15 minutes before I got fed up to go inside and have one of them say Its been ready  Worst customer service Ive ever received at ANY McDonalds Way to be terrible
4511,1,Takes forever to get your food
4468,1,Horrible The fries taste like ass
15551,1,If I could give it 0 stars I would Place is dirty staff are rude I dont think this is a good place anymore It took ten minutes to take my order and ten minutes for my food to come out This isnt fast food The vibe in the air is like were in a Funeral Home Never eat here
15552,1,Drive thru is super slow and curb side isnt available in the evenings Buns can also be stale at times
15574,1,I ordered a filetofish which I order everytime I get s meal at McDonalds The fish was WAY over cooked and greasy It didnt even look like a piece of fish The fries were almost burned not at all like McDonalds normally cooks them I told them I was not eating fish that looked like thatand to give me something else They gave me a Quarter Pounder and new fries which were still over cooked The Quarter Pounder was the worst Ive ever eatenvery greasy I will never visit this location again
4412,1,Rude people behind the counter and literally waited 10 minutes for a large fries and 6 piece nuggets
4413,1,Very little seating inside and no bathroom
4414,1,Dont go no more 24 hours
30045,1,McDonalds just needs to SHUTDOWN  Every McDonalds in the Orlando areanone EVER open on time systems are ALWAYS down CASH ONLY in the early morning hours IF you can find one that is ACTUALLY OPEN  Sign on door states open at 500amand at 605am still closed
30044,1,"Incredibly slow service sat in the drivethru for at least 10 minutes without the line moving When I finally got my food the crispy chicken sandwich tasted stale the texture was very chewy and not crisp at all on top of that I wasnt asked if I wanted any ketchup or sauces the sandwich didnt have a drop of mayonnaise or anything on it just oddly dry pickles and a soggy bun I had to park and go inside to get condiments As has become almost expected with the McDonalds experience the soda tasted like sanitizer Never again at this location
I only stop at McDonalds if I am blindingly hungry on the verge of passing out and still my past 3 experiences at three locations around Orlando have been disgusting

Update Got food poisoning and this is the last thing I ate"
15577,1,Waited in parking lot  for 15 minutes just for no one to answer Shouldn
30042,1,This place is terrible  They have no inside seating  which I guess happens  But the manager on duty this morning when asked about the seating simply waved my wife off and shooed her away without even taking her cell phone from her ear   shameful  we just wanted to have a quick bite before getting on the road on the tail of the tropical storm  The one bright light was the very sweet and friendly young lady that took our order   Wish I knew both names so that I call them out both good for the young lady and BAD for the manager lady on duty
15571,1,They never get the orders right they never give you your receipt I ordered a coffee and the sign said it was a dollar they told me it was no longer a sale but the sign was still there I had to pay like a dollar 79 for the sign to say a dollar coffee I thought they would honor it but they didnt the service is very slow
30037,1,McDonalds is already a horrible franchise with horrendous service but this location is SO bad that I wanted to write this review to advise NOBODY to come to this location The service is a joke The food always comes out wrong The staff is not fr
15569,1,This location is not 24 hours Went to the window around 11pm said they were closed and to order with the app Of course they never have any of the frozen frozen drinks
4424,1,Staff had attitude wont open the bathroom

4426,1,No toilet paper in the bathroom and it smelled horrible
15572,1,1 star because workers apparently dont know items on their menu then give you attitude because they dont know it I almost laughed at how unprofessional that was felt like I was giving my order to a 8yr old But no it was a full grown lady ridiculous haha
15578,1,Been here 4 separate times at night and no one takes orders or even acts like they are open It says 24 hours but after 1am they stop serving customers This place sucks
4406,1,They said they had two lines to order After we split into two lines they only took care of one line That is so ridiculous
30051,1,"Unbelievably SLOW I ordered 2 cheese burgers and 1 frappe They took almost 30 minutes to get our food When they finally came to give us food the employee gave us the wrong food and had the BIGGEST attitude when I said the order was wrong DONT COME HERE IF YOU WANT FAST FOOD ITS MORE LIKE SLOW FOOD Dont recommend horrible will not return again
Another thing is put cheese burgers were cold and dry The frappes weren"
4390,1,It was the worst experience it sucked I got home and everything was wrong
30063,1,"Thank you for the cold breakfast Made me wait almost 40 minutes Families got theirs before my lil sandwich and coffee They just forgot about my meal and let it sit Only thing warm was the coffeebarely
Not anyone"
4392,1,Very slow service at this McDonalds and the tables werent clean at all The floors were sticky too
30062,1,We waited for 50 minutes in the drive through The line moved at the beginning but then stopped completely near the order box Because of the way the cars are channeled through a curbed path we couldnt escape We were trapped and had no choice but to sit and wait It was very frustrating The order we received was correct but we didnt get any apology or explanation Well Mark this location on the map and never go here again
4394,1,"Very dirty
Table never cleaned
Restroom out of order
Do not forget to bring your maid with you if you need clean table"
15584,1,I was picking up a door dash order and the drive thru guy was eating fries with no gloves and no mask plus he gave me the order with out washing his hand that where oily from the fries he was eating feel sorry for the people eating at this location smh
15583,1,This was the saddest McDonalds Everything was poor even the bathroom Had no tissue The manager said they were out So this male maintenance guy gave me a big hand full of napkins and said sorry Wow 
30056,1,Literally the worst McDonalds Ive ever been to
15582,1,The lady that works on wensdaythursday and friday morning at 5 is very rudeIts like we r bothering her when we place a order through drivethru
4399,1,Dirtiest especially the bathroom slowest and rudest McDonalds I

4403,1,I was order take out they May used return food cold burger  different bread  cheese

4427,1,20 minutes for two burgers while every one chats texts and caters to friends 
30036,1,If I could give 0 stars I would We got turned away at the drive thru because they stated we are short staffed and really busy we cant take any more orders for 20 minutes and when I asked if I could wait in the drive thru they told me no because the drive thru is timed and it would time out I understand being short staffed and running behind on orders thats understandable but telling people youre not taking orders for the next 20 minutes I mean come on I am not sure who is managing this location but turning away business Seems like a poor business practice to me This happened on 1017 at 1030 by the way
15566,1,Ive eaten McDonalds EVERYDAY for lunch for over 2 years I know its unhealthy but thats not what were here for and due to my employment Ive eaten at many MANY McDonalds all over Austin and surrounding cities and this location has by far the worst staff of any McDonalds in the greater Austin area
4430,1,This place was already slow now the touch screen kiosks make it even worse
4451,1,Nasty inside and burger was not fresh at all avoid
15556,1,So no one answered The guy who took my order was very rude they had me waiting in the first window like about 15 minutes I knocked at the window and no one would ever come out Other 5 cars were behind me waiting VERY SLOW AND BAD SERVICE If you

4456,1,Dirty and security guard wants to kick you out for no reason
22789,1,Pretty sure I died from eating here
30019,1,Ignored me at the counter then told me i had to order at the kiosk when i asked then walked away I have tried in the past but my special order  can not be accomplished on the kiosk even the workers had me go to the main counter So i did to not get what i wanted this time Bad service Plus during covid not everyone shouldnt be using the same touch screen i didnt feel safe
30018,1,Very bad service I have ordered and want to pay cash the atender wont come to get the payment she says

15553,1,"Went here a few days ago around 10pm to get some food Guess what the person at the drivethru told me

Im sorry but were out of burgers

We truly are in endtimes folks Brace yourselves"
30016,1,Waited ages for food cold when arrived at table and items missing  Stood in a queue full of people complaining to get food sorted by which time the rest of our order was stone cold Staff not very pleasant and looked like they didnt care at all  Not a good experience and wont be back
30024,1,Dining closed early with no updates online 48 minutes in the drive through at the end they dont have what we want f off  So bad experience  Such a loser team
15513,1,My food was overcooked The lettuce they put on my hot  spicy was brown and it looked like it needed to thrown away I waited almost twenty minutes for a six dollar meal Their fountain drink machine needs to be fixed The orange hic is just orange syrup and the sprite taste like carbonated water I wont be going back there
15557,1,this is the worst place ever i guess the qualification to work here is rude every single person that works here is RUDE the order is NEVER right and again they are RUDE like you choose to work here so why be rude be the best you can be at McDonalds the inside is always dirty i will never eat here again
4447,1,Dirty messy stinky The only positive note is the staff
15565,1,Worst mcds Ive been to Come here twice and both times horrible experiences Dont know if its McDonalds standards to hire employees that dont know basic math or how to read They have a screen and a receipt but they still mess up on how many meals the I order I will never come back to this place ever again
30034,1,"Both online and the sign here says they are 24hr Tried coming in to get some food for my kids last night after a 7 hrs road trip They had shut down the drive through and doors When I CALLED THE STORE AND ASKED THE MANAGER HUNG UP IN MY FACE 2 TIMES WHEN ALL I WAS ASKING WAS WHAT TIME DO THEY CLOSE AND WHY DOES IT SAY 24 HOURS IF YOUR SHUT DOWN

THEN I PROCEEDED TO CALL THE NEXT MORNING AND ASKED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED TOLD HER ID LIKE THE MANAGER NAME FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE TO REPORT IT TO COORPRATE SHE THEN TOO HUNG UP IN MY FACE TOO

THESE ARE THR MANAGERS ACTING LIKE THAT  IM FAR BEYOND DISSAPOINTED AND I WILL BE STILL REACHING OUT TO COORPRATE  THEY DONT DESERVE THEIR JOBS AT ALL SOMONE ELSE WOULD REALLY NEED THAT JOB AND TREAT THE CUSTOMERS PROPER "
30032,1,"This place is awful
The lines are looooong inside or drive through being waiting for 45 minutes for 2 happy meals
I think is one of the slowest in the state
Needs lots of work hopefully management gets involved and fix the deficiencies"
15564,1,Im not a big fan of mcdonalds at all but for the first time in forever I came to a mcdonalds cause my friend wanted to get quick food When I asked for some extra sauce the manger was kinda rude about telling me how it cost extra Then my friend orders 1 regular mcChicken sandwiche The gave her a hot new spicy sandwich 3 tries later they keep giving us a spicy instead of regular I am really disappointed as well as my friends were This is why I dont come to mcdonalds

30025,1,Asked for an iced caramel latte and they gave me an iced coffee Went back and payed AGAIN for an iced caramel latte and they gave me a cup with pure white milk only and no caramel at all Is it that hard to make a latte

15455,1,This location is horrible even the foreign manager guy He got an attitude about issuing a refund for an item that they were out of and tried to refund me the wrong amount when I told him it was the wrong amount he asked me for a receipt even though I had never left the window He
15458,1,This is by far the most unprofessional  location I have ever had the displeasure of visiting The staff as a whole are lazy and not at all interested in customer or service French fries taste like they were cooked hours before being served fountain drinks taste like bath water only slightly warmer Hours are misposted on the entrance door and for serving product that is already cooked and just sitting under the heat lamp they are in a league of their own when it comes to the slowness of their service I will gladly drive twenty miles out of my way to avoid this location in the future
15464,1,My fries were so nasty and dark brown The lady I spoke with swears that they were fresh But I was so out done that she didnt even say bring them back and well correct the problem because our job is to satisfy the customer Or even take my name to replace it on my next visit But she was very argumentative Maybe next time it will be better
29884,1,Waited in the drive through no one said they dont get new orders Had to step inside to figure it out
29887,1,Dining room is supposed to be open until midnight  I showed up at 1055  and the doors were locked The employees just ignored us

15471,1,"As the mother of an employee who is encouraging her to maintain a level of financial responsibility while attending school The level of treatment receive by African American vs Hispanic employess is very saddening What I will not encourage is for her to accept mistreatment or bei g misused by any establishment on any level She was refused breaks on more than one occasion and tonight was told to clock out after drinking water while being made to order runner and on friesI would strongly recommend that Managers be
However I am aware that there was also another manager there by the name of Irenetrained in what managing really intels O called the store and the Manager refused her name not to mention my daughter doesnt even know her name This is unacceptable on all levels and it needs to be addressed I will most certainly be reaching out to higher in command"
15470,1,Hated my experience going inside the cashier was flustered and kept messing up I paid for a large drink but she hands me a medium cup they were out of ice on both drink fountains and when the manager was told she already knew  Then someone said were not out theyre both broken  So wheres the sign letting the customers know  And out of all that my fries had no salt on them now yall know thats the best part of your trip to Mickey Dees eating the hot fries smh
29897,1,The worst experience 47 minutes for our food after complaining People ahead of us are still there waiting DO NOT GO
4640,1,Is a dirty place
29895,1,No chocolate shakes available  This location should have good stocks of everything
4642,1,Bathroom is disgusting
15467,1,I get to the drive though at 1115pm I figure since theres not a big line it should not take long and will be back to work on time by 12am Its currently 1215am and I can neither go forward or back in the drive though to get out Thanks for the write up McDs I understand its not like it used to be and fast food isnt 5min fast but with an hour I can sit at a restaurant and eat and have time remaining
29891,1,Went to this location around 3am and placed an order through the app Waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes with other cars to then be told they are closed only The manager refused to refund my order and also refused to give me her name The manager that works there during the night should not be in management and lacks customer service skills along with the other 3 employees that refused to acknowledge us at the drive thru window This location needs training from corporate and should not have the open 24 hours a day signs on their windows Very disappointed in my experience at this McDonalds
29890,1,Food was terrible and so much missing Service even worse  Like eating at Karens restaurant in UK  AVOID AT ALL COSTS 
15465,1,I would like to say that I am highly disappointed that this is my 2nd time getting 2 Large sweet teas from this facility only to arrive at work and find out they taste horrible This is the convenient location on my way to work and the usual drive thru workers know my vehicle so they normally get it right but when there is someone different at the window HOW HARD IS IT TO ENTER THE RIGHT ORDER IN THE SCREEN LARGE SWEET TEAS I shouldnt have to hold up the drive thru line to taste the teas each time they give them to me Then they get an attitude when you ask for your receipt or a managers name HORRIBLE SERVICE
4648,1,Place was dirty
29867,1,The worst McD Ive ever been to Waited 30 minutes for our food They were just overrun with peo
29866,1,My kids are big on McDonalds and I thought it would be fun for them Big mistake Place is a dump and a joke The food was cold and the facility is filthy The drink area had no ice in 6 dispensers No ketchup The play area was frightenin
29865,1,Please hire employees that actually want to work and like their job and smile this girl that just took my order with extremely long red Nails was very unpleasant Do you follow a dress code in this establishment Also this must be the saddest sundae i have ever received half the Carmel was outside the cup  Maybe that
15453,1,Was told I couldnt place a 
4694,1,rude
15436,1,Go to the McDonalds in Capital plaza because the one off of 290 always has still fries and their food just aint good TheyMac rib wasnt even warmed up all the way Ill never go to that McDonalds every in my life
29844,1,Staff stole 250 out of a bag that my little sister had brought absolutely devastated never go here such cheeky and careless staff I am so angry do not go to this McDonald
29843,1,Waited to long at drive thru while other line was moving App code for deal canceled out and I had to wait for the code to appear again Crew not helpful at drive thru or inside
4698,1,Disrespectful
15435,1,This is handsdown without argument the worse McDonalds in America do not waste your time go somewhere else Literally just a drivethru is open and they still have to stop for 10 to 15 minutes to get there s back together numerous times have I been in the DriveThru and had to wait 30 minutes plus for these stupid MFrs to figure out how to do their job correctly You just need to close down this location and let a fast food company that knows what theyre doing take over it There is another McDonalds less than three minutes from this McDonalds I highly encourage you to go to that one
15434,1,I love doing curbside pick up because I dont like talking to people and its less contact and usually online they have better deals Well today I have decided I will never be doing that again i ordered a coffee and a chicken biscuit on the app and went to my spot in one of the curbside pick up locations After about 15 minutes of waiting i decided to call a young gentlemen answered the phone and confirmed that they had my order and it would be out when its ready I told them it has been almost 20 minutes and to please hurry another 10 minutes went by and I had to go back to work I left withit my food and without my coffee which is really why I went there Normally id just take the loss but Im very sad Im uncaffinated right now
29841,1,Rude staff  Slow food delivery  Kiosk may save the owner money but it is slow and convoluted  Not sure why you take a number for table side service and then have to go to counter to pick it up   Food quality is poor
15433,1,I ordered oatmeal and received a cup of cream When I call the person who identified themself as the Manger hung up on me
15431,1,This location sucks every time I ordered here they messed up something and the workers were rude But thank God I dont live in the are no more
15430,1,Some new staff members working the drive thru need additional training A few separate occasions recently have had issues getting the order right and choose argument instead of remedy
4705,1,Bad Attitude
15429,1,If I could give zero stars I would the employees are very rude 
22813,1,"I never seen a place full with kids employees
no body care what you looking for rod customer service by rosalina she made you like you were asking for free food"
29836,1,Rude and unattentive staff   They were not even busy and I asked can I order my food at the register basically was told you have to use the kiosk and she walked away from me  Not offering any type of assistance or making you feel welcome in any way  I turned around and walked out the door
15437,1,"Waited in the drive thru for 10 minutes just for no one to answer

Update gave them a second chance  yet again "
15474,1,They close the lobby earlier than what is posted they got our order wrong 3 times They make faces when we asked for the correct things They made us pay for an order of fries that should have already been included in our order It took us so long to get through that drive thru and the entire situation was a complete mess Smh
29846,1,Do not order here  the fries were only full and they didnt give me any of my sauces very dissatisfied When I called at 230 am the lady who answered was so rude
4689,1,Rude
15452,1,No wonder they have a 3 star Hours arent correct people standing around inside doing nothing with 30 car line McDonald isnt what it used to be
29861,1,Didnt know you could barricade customers out with trash cans one and a half hours before closi
29860,1,Hours are inaccurate they close the dining room before 1100 not midnight as is posted on their doors The tea also has the distinct taste of coffee which makes it taste like burnt teagross
15450,1,Please if you dont want to work theredont go
15448,1,Horrible drive thru service at lunch time
29855,1,Arrived at the McDonalds at 1020PM and the posted hours said the location was open until 1200AM An employee locked the door and barricaded it with a trash bin and didnt let us in until we mobile ordered although another employee seemed confused by this Another employee was also telling people that the lobby was closed again even though the hours stated that the location would be open until 12AM Additionally while this happened there were at least a dozen people sitting down and eating and there were empty tables
15447,1,They always take too long to take your order and when they do they ALWAYS give it wrong one of the worst McDonald
29853,1,Went through the drivethru and ordered my food and when it got to the window only charged  for one meal and I had asked for two then had told me to pull over to the side and waited for a long time that forgotten about me So I had to go back in and tell them about my order And when I went back to let them know they  gave me look like I was bothering Ive never apologized poor management
22808,1,Raw burger Spoke with manager Nattie she defended the raw burger saying it passed a temperature check She reluctantly agreed to make a new one a took my receipt  20 minutes later still no burger Went to the counter a girl there gave the burger to someone else Another burger was made but they lost the receipt  While standing at the counter waiting for a receipt to be reprinted I was holding onto my bag A man behind the counter tried to grab the bag out of my hand I told him hands off he said he was checking the order number TOTAL INCOMPETENCE I went to complete the survey on the receipt BUT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED
22810,1,I had this same meal in Las Palmas Orlando Florida and the difference was night and day  Sorry should have taken picture B4 I started eating but look at the pork and meat that I didnt touch  Never again
15443,1,If I could give this mcdonalds negative stars I would there whole system is down they act like they dont know that There is a line all the way on the streets If your in a hurry to go anywhere dont come here around 3pm cause you would be late Even inside kiosk is down all 4 of them just crazy This makes 3 day in a row
29848,1,If I could give 0 starts I would been here several times and the service is trash They never have anything Didnt have ranch sauce or McFlurry or any other hamburgers They only had nuggets and this is what I get with a white stuff in it Don
15441,1,The clerk 290E was the worst Rather than an Im here to help aura she had an I could care lessyoure bothering me and I will spit in your food attitude Thats scary Theres another McDonalds 10 minutes away and a Jack in the Box across the street Thank God for options
29847,1,How do you go to a McDonalds that says 24 hours there
15440,1,Something is wrong at this location  Busy or slow the food does not taste right  The fries are limp and soaked in grease   The burgers taste old  Quality Control is not being done  Going to give this location time to regroup
4690,1,Worst
4388,1,The worst one ever So rude staff Dirty floor Wont come back
15475,1,We are staying at the hotel next door My husband checks online to make sure the restaurant and dining room are open They are He walks over and the doors are locked Walks back to the hotel takes his car through the drive through sits for 10 minutes and receives no service although there were employees in the restaurant He sees other cars trying to receive service but they are all being ignored He comes back to the hotel and calls again at least 6 times each time it says the number is disconnected even though he had already confirmed they were open through the same number earlier Finally someone answers the call he asks if they are open and they said no he asked them why they answered the phone and were in the restaurant at 1am if it is closed they said because their job is just to answer the phone Its clear that the employees wanted to get paid for working all night without serving any customers My husband used to work in fast food and I wanted to believe that the stereotypes of McDonalds employees being terrible people and workers to not be true but this location makes the company look bad McDonalds should fire the franchise owner or shut this location down because they clearly dont know how to hire dependable employees
15477,1,"The manager and or the Owner does not have business sense Poor staffing for the late shift I pulled up to order some french fries at 1030 and was told it will be a 20 minute wait and to pull to the parking lot I asked why and the person said I have to go to school in the morning He said the owner do the hiring and it is not his fault 1 Bad choice of words 2 They may need to not be a 24 hour McDonalds 3 Hire appropriate staff
I was taken back be the unprofessionalism I was handed And charged 2 for a small order of fries  SMH I am glad that my mood was good However I do not feel sorry for reporting them to the BBB and giving a BAD rating They need to do better or get better ownership because they McDonalds look bad"
15504,1,This Place is Horrible The Manager JOSUE is absolutely the worst person youll ever meet The Employees are treated wrong and he always uses a scapegoat to deal with problems I dont see why he became manager Apart from that the Place is filthy the dr
29951,1,Only giving one star because zero stars isnt an option Wanted to pay cash at register and was told to use kiosk Kiosk never gave an option for cash pay Employees wandering the store on their phones and ignoring customers When asked for napkins an employee went thru two other employees instead of just handing customer napkins No organization at all and rude as can be Gave me diet soda when I asked for regular they rolled their eyes I understand its busy but this place could be handled better Go anywhere but here
29949,1,I dont understand why all the time that I come to eat in here is always a problem All the employees doing nothing the restaurante  is always slow at night its empty and they take ho
4577,1,Service is too bad
15503,1,Service real slow   It appears that the Manager and a staff showed the customers there open dis agreement  Staff was loud Managet was the same  You take all disagreement to the back not on front  Seems like a racial disagreement Time 230pmNot Good on the manager part
22801,1,I came to this mcdonalds to pick up an order for a customer as I deliver with Uber Eats and the manager refused to make the order because he said we are too busy and dont have the time to prepare such a big order plus these are lunch and dinner items we will be switching over to breakfast in 20 minutes So my customer was cheated out of their order and I was screwed out of 35 I reported the restaurant to Uber support as well as Mcdonalds corporate offices Avoid this mcdonalds if you can Terrible
29954,1,Twice theyve forgotten loads of my order on uber eats No refunds Nothing Absolutely a joke
4580,1,The worst McDonald
4582,1,Awful
15500,1,This McDonalds is very low on service  When i first walked there was a smell of something rooting or something else and it just smelled horrible Everyone that walked i  would seem that  The soda station had trash on it the tables werent clean I also had to wait an extra 10 min for my food but it was already ready but the people were just standing around not calling out my orderi had to go up to them and say is that my order and the guy said i dont know
29945,1,"Terrible customer service the lady at the drivethru was handing me someone else order after me telling her my order is an online order she then got mad and left the window then the second young lady told me to go to the third window without telling me that they just received my order and is in the process of making it I called the store and the manager was nasty after I was just telling him that Communication would have been nice and yelling at me telling me I dont need to tell him that and I asked for corporate number and the lady said they dont have it and I asked for her name and she walked away quickly from me rude everyone here is rude and disrespectful and no communication with there customers

I would recommend going to a different location thats mo"
29944,1,Terrible service Cashier had a bad attitude and was very disrespectful Refused to give her name Found out it is Brittany Female manager seemed clueless amd not helpful whatsoever After over an hour from the time we entered the drive thru til we got our food it was still made wrong Weve submitted the issue to corporate requesting contact No response Obviously they do not care about their customers
15499,1,Slow and rude The female who took my order had trouble understanding english as I repeatedly had to tell her that I didnt want a drink with my 2 Then it took 20 minutes to get to the window I was already late for work and sped off after another 5 minutes I called both the store and corporate to complain Never got through to either Im not going back to any McDonalds Ever
29941,1,Horrible Service Lazy Workers Took Forever to make my order ans there liars
15501,1,Sat at one of the drive thru station for 5 minutes without anyone asking for our order Saw the other order station was taking orders Went inside and couldnt get anyones attention to ask about it maybe being broken they have 
15505,1,The kiosks suck People cant figure out how to use them so you have to wait If you can get someone at the register they act put out I managed to skip the kiosk and had to wait longer than the people that took forever figuring out the kiosks Been here 10 minutes and s
29955,1,When you go on slow Thursday night order yourself a nice Double Quater pounder with  cheese to go after a long days work Only to see you get a single quater pounder No cheese and i guess they decided to throw in some lettuce on there No sauce like 5 pickles  Too tired to go get a refund c
29957,1,Although conveniently located to several hotels the hour wait to get my order shows incapability to handle the extra patronage They are not adequately staffed to handle the extra flow of being centrally located Even when we were at the window it seems they were still scrambling to put our order together Once back the hotel we discovered that one of our orders was wrong They placed bacon on one of the fish sandwiches
29969,1,Its not actually a 24hour store Theyre open but if you go at night around 300 am and 400 am its going to be closed I think they switch for a dinner to breakfast but its unfair for people who work third shift like myself I can almost never get McDonalds Its funny cuz they also barricade all the doors and drive throughs
4553,1,Treat customers very bad
29968,1,We walked over from the hotel that was in the same lot The door sign said the dining room was open to 3am We got in the dinning room at about 1030 when other costumers who were already inside walked out We were asked to leave as the dining room was 
29967,1,I ordered breakfast at 834 January 16 2022 order 1386 order 86 We could have ate breakfast at the resort we are staying at but my family elected for McDonalds instead Not only did I have to wait an extended period three to five minutes at the order board but we had a large order When I got up to window number one the girl working the window was rude did not want to allow me to review my large order with her spoke extremely fast and unprofessional then rushed me to the next window without even paying Once I drove to the next window I was handed my food still hadnt paid tried reviewing the order again and the woman didnt listen or pay me any attention I sat patiently and she rushed back to the window to collect payment AFTER everything was given to me Our re under cooked mushy but the rest of or breakfast was good I would relay to your staff that the overall experience drives a customer back not just the food Wendys filled the remainder of our order efficie
4556,1,Garbage foodgarbage pricesgarbage employees
15511,1,Came here at 10pm and this is how I got my meal
29964,1,Terrible  I never write reviews but couldnt complete my day consciously without expressing my frustration Its one thing to be busy and dealing with the public I know its challenging To be rude  for absolutely no reason  when simply asking a question such as 
29963,1,Waited in drivethru for 30 mins finally got up to order  nothing We kept asking if anyone is there Kid finally comes on that they had to reboot the system  could be another 15 mins at least We told him he needs to tell people as there is a line around the building Truly horrible service
4560,1,Bad service
29961,1,We had a great dat at SeaWorld with the gkids and decided to swing by and get ice cream for them on the way home  Well we get there and there is a line out the door because only one of the 6 kiosks are open  We wait in line for 30min and as my wife gets to order they shut it down to only drive thru   Absolutely horrible customer service and the lack of care from the manager was disgusting and extremely disappointing  Never would I say this company is a favorite of mine but now I never plan to visit again
15508,1,Its was all good until me and a couple of friends came into the lobby and a gentleman who looked to be Hispanic with dark hair and a dark beard was complaining to a manager about how he has already cleaned the lobby twice and doesnt wanna clean it a third time assuming we were the problemnot to mention other comments that were made about us coming in and I thought that was very uncool I get coming in late but this place is 24 
4565,1,Bad place to receive service
29959,1,McDonalds corporate you need to investigate this location immediately The customer service is highly lacking and Im positive the management of that location is damaging your brand Not only is service extremely slow but the drive through service provider and the manager is horrible We literally witnessed people driving away from the intercom after waiting and waiting with no response We drove up to the intercom and waited and waited Zero response We spoke multiple times No reaponse No one greeted us No one asked us to wait Nothing Radio silence Then we dro e up to window only to face a combative manager with a chip on his shoulder Needless to say we drove away without making an order It was an experience that definitely does not live up to the world renowned brand standards of McDonalds
29958,1,"My friends and family were denied service at this location because we prefer to place our order with a human rather than a kiosk  1st by an employee then by the manager VERY  RUDE
10922 1120 am"
15507,1,"I love how on their door they say the drive thru is open till 12am however between 1130pm1135pm I sat there waiting for someone to respond to me at the speakerbox I didnt know they had closed their drive thru window early until a customer who was leaving let me know But Im not the type to critique without leaving advice so heres some for free

This is like 300IQ so get ready You get a piece of paper and write something to the effect of drive thru closed and tape it to the drive thru speakerbox This will effectively let everyone except blind drivers know that no one in the store will be taking your order For blind drivers and other drivers you can just use the speakerbox to let them know"
4588,1,No bathroom
29940,1,"RUN AWAY FROM THIS PLACE We just went through the drive through and the teen girl sounded like she was depressed and going to jump

We ordered 2 doubles 2 chicken 1 large fries and 2 large drinks Everything everything tasted hard like cardboard The fries were extremely hot and hard and crunchy like stones Both the chicken and doubles had no  no  no flavor at all and was dry as sawdust and cardboard For the sodas one was a diet coke and other was a reg coke both were large size which they did not get right the first time Both sodas tasted like they were full of cinnamon flavor

The food was over dry and tasteless The staff at this location needs to learn how to throw away yesterdays old foodif not last weeks old junk

Its almost a guarantee your food will taste horrible And your money wasted save yourself time and go somewhere else you will be glad you did"
4590,1,Disgusting food Cold Food
15498,1,I ordered 9 peoples food received only one packafter immediately I called this location Walmart inside McDonalds spoke to one lady or manger I dont no who she she said want come pickup the food I said I cant come she said ok we cant give refundshe talking very rudely please dont c
29926,1,"Rude amateur counter staff asked cleaner a question just pointed me to the front counter without saying a word more expensive tourist area
Overall nice building thats about it food arrived to table cold
Just like being in a Circusfull of clowns"
15486,1,Surprise up charges then they blame you for it I wont return to this location again
15485,1,I ordered breakfast with no line and took 10 minutes to tell me they didnt have that breakfast item available There were about 10 employees not really that busy So I said ok to something equivalent in cash value Then they had an issue getting a mocha coffee out due to some poor understanding of the machine So after fifteen minutes I left my food on the counter and walked away before I started yelling at a manager I dont like to do that but just reaffirms that this particular McDonald
29924,1,These employees dont know how to prepare Mobile Orders You build your order on the phone and pay for everything you added then the employees give you the wrong thing I ordered an iced latte with caramel drizzle and whipped cream I received a regular iced coffee with nothing that I paid extra for This had happened 3 or 4 times now
29923,1,Worst McDonalds ever  No personal service or friendly service   Stay away and have a good day somewhere else
4617,1,I hate McDonalds 
15484,1,Ice cream was gritty and the fudge they put on my daughters sundae was runny and tasted a little like coffee We trashed it before we left the parking lot Better luck next time
15483,1,Do you want dysentery cholera or one of the Big5 Then eat here otherwise you would be wise to avoid this McDonalds as if it were the plague Immediately upon walking through the door I was stunned by an extremely offensive and pungent odor It was so difficult to focus on much else due to the severity of the smell This was not a smell of hamburgers or French fries this was the smell of spilled milk that had soured and marred in the 100 Texas heat for weeks Truly this smell is likely from the repeated spilling of soda at the drink stations that had either been overlooked or merely disregarded by careless employees Beyond the smell the sights were just as appalling There were trays with discarded food and wrappers lining the tables as well as smashed food around the floor Granted the trays are the result of lazy and inconsiderate people that believe they shouldnt be required to tend to their mess the employees should have direction from management to conduct a lobby check at set periods to ensure this doesnt result in customer  dissatisfaction All this being said I simply walked into the lobby to order a drink and I would have been on my merry way I stood at the counter and waited for one of the cashiers to acknowledge that they were ready to take my order I received numerous glances from who I assumed was the front of store worker I was the only customer in line in the lobby but understood that there was also a drive through at which customers were present I waited a bit longer received additional glances from previously said employees Still I was not asked for my order I was doing nothing that would have given the appearance that I was unready to order I was not on the phone not fiddling with my wallet I was standing quietly intently looking at multiple employees that dismissed my presence 4 employees present 2 managers in the back and zero orders from me This normally would not have been an issue I would have waited a bit longer but the lack of regard for cleanliness and the piercing stench that wafted throughout the lobby forced me to leave Im not likely to enter this facility nor purchase any product from this store after today If the management and workers leave the front of the store in such a state it forces me to wonder about the areas where customers cannot see To all those that dare enter ye be warned
4620,1,Broken toy  
29920,1,To hell with this McDonalds They closed their lobby 10
15482,1,The customer service is very very bad I waited there for almost 25 minutes to be served Thats not the first time I was there like that So I walked out and I went to the drivethru I was in the drive through and out of the drivethru probably in about 3 minutes That is the worst manager I have ever seen
15480,1,Ive been to this location a few times and everytime I have been the food is always old and the fries taste like they have been sitting for hours They are always out of sweet tea and coffee and it seems like nobody cares about the quality of food that is being served
15479,1,Longest Drive Through experience for a couplr dollar menu items Loved pulling around the front and waiting while watching 3 more cars behind me get orders and go about their day
29911,1,This place really should be shut down If they cant deliver in customer service just close  I ordered with them and waited for 45 minutes  I asked them after 10 minutes about my order and they said its coming up  After 20 minutes I ask again about my order and the supervisor tells me one at a time I cant skip your order in front of other people  She then proceeds to continue skipping my order to serve other people  At 45 minutes I asked again and she finds my order on a table and says to her coworker they never made it   Nobody gave an apology or acknowledged they were in the wrong  If you cant run a restaurant correctly then please just shut down  There are countless pictures on their reviews of cars piling up and terrible customer service
15478,1,Everyone knows what they get at this McDonaldsbut come on now  1st being forced to order from the new kiosnot to hard but its slow and takes forever But numerous people came in after me and ordered from the front cashier and all of the 20 orders got there food before I did  Normally I wouldnt post something like this  But ive been to this McDonalds 5 times and this was my best experience yet
29928,1,Negative review  One of the busiest locations in Orlando and absolutely no customer service Everywhere else you can dine in except in McDonalds CRAZY
15476,1,"Even If you get there first in the drive thru everyday only a limited places to eat with my time maybe 3 to 5 people behind you order a simple 1 meal you get pushed to the pick up meal area with the same 3 to 5 waiting for our food Just and sometimes the people behind you get their food first and they ordered more than you And by the time I get my food the fries are stale and super salty
It seems like they are trying to out clear their drive thru numbers to show corporate they are clearing numbers"
4610,1,So dirty
4607,1,Avoid at all cost
29938,1,Brittany The Manager was completely rude and wanted to call the cops just because I ordered a cup of coffee and their whole system was down
15497,1,This place might as well close at night with how long it takes
15496,1,The only thing open is the drive thru I drive a large truck that will not fit in the drive thru and they will not answer the phone to place an order to pickup So tried the app they want you to order from and after 20 minutes going through all the questions switching from screen to screen and placing my order then giving them my CC info it tells me that the location is closed I look over at the 15 or so cars going through the drive thru getting their food and decided I really didnt want their food anyways now or in the future
29934,1,"Hawaiian Court location 
Staffing issues really not helping this location live up to the Fast Food label
From order to recieving the food it took 42mins and even then the order came out wrong
There was one manager one fry cook and one burger cook trying to complete a dinner time rush yet there were 3 cleaning staff going round cleaning 1 table every 20mins or so
This team could really do with some logistical training on how to get orders out efficiently and on time because this really was a poor attempt at fast food"
29932,1,Food is terrible but the workers are very polite
15495,1,"Waited 10 minutes in front of the register
They never Acknowledged our presence thereEmployees and Manager were just talking not doing anything
Then the girl from the drive thru comes and takes our orderI ask whos the Manager on duty she replies its the guy in white shirt
He happens to come to the counter and i told him his service here sucks
He looks at me and says so what I dont care
This is coming from the Manager
When you first walk into this McDonalds it stinks like dirty diapers
This location always stinks and customer service is very Horrible
This is the only location close to my work
Manager and employees are there for a paycheck onlyNOT customer service
The Owners should do a surprise visit there"
22802,1,The food is always cold theres always a long wait time and some of the managers just dont care One of them was mad I complained about my fries not being cooked all the way so he snatched them out of my childs hand and those were not even the ones I was complaining about he then asked me if I had a recipe When he was the one that took my money and didnt give me one
15493,1,I placed my order on the mobile app this morning and I waited 10 minutes for my order to come out to the curbside and still nothing I thought this way or ordering is suppose to be faster than waiting in the long line of the drive thru I finally left since I was already late for work since they took long I called to find out what was going on and no one will answer the phone
4600,1,Ratchet ghetto messy unorganized
15492,1,Usually McDonalds allows you to pay w Credit card grab your cup so you can satisfy your thrist if the staff is too busy  This McDonalds I paid for a meal and went to grab my cup just I like I do 4 days a week and the staff woman yelled at me and accused me stealing despite the proof of payment  in hand They were  Very ugly mean and disrespectful
15491,1,Wow I meanwow Over 5 employees and they all need to work on their people skills Its just so disappointing on how they attended us Restrooms were a mess  it wasnt even packed and to top it off one of the employees was eating fries out of the fry tray while preparing orders I just dont know what else to say other than I will NEVER come back to this location
15490,1,"For this Franchise company to be how do I put it nicely in a lowincome area this McDonald was way overpriced the owner speculated everyone receives unemployment
Dear Owner
Note to yourself NOT everyone receives unemployment and we have jobs Rethink your prices and start paying your employees better
Thank you

16415,1,It took several minutes for someone to take our order then our order took forever and was wrong My Mc muffin was rock hard and instead of the cheeseburger my friend ordered he received a Mc chicken with cheese they were out of sweet tea and the little straw trash bin on the soda fountain was bursting out and spilling into the ice catch This facility is dirty packed both inside and in the drive thru and is obviously understaffed
16416,1,"They got my order wrong This happens often

To make things worse they are very inefficient Ordered a small fries they served 10 other people before I got mine Seriously fill up a small bag with fries while you await other order burgers I used to worl at McDonalds 10 years ago and know how it should be run Horrible

Ironically two other individuals complained about their order while I waited and one got into an argument with the manager over cold cheese"
3355,1,Bad service and cold food
22235,1,Lost McDonalds in Honolulu if you can avoid going here I would The staff are rude and very cheap I ordered 2 spicy chicken meals and our burgers werent even in the bun everything was all over the place When I asked the girl there for more sauce since we had 2 burgers and 2 fries but she said they dont give it I went to the McDonalds 2 mins aways yesterday and they gave me as many sauces as I needed without charge I would suggest walking the extra 5 mins and going to the other McDonalds its worth it Avoid this staff rude and cheap

16423,1,I ordered a Mcdouble which was on their outside drive thru menu When it came up on the order screen it was shown as a Bacon Mcdouble I told them that I just wanted the regular Mcdouble no bacon So all they did was note NO Bacon and still charged me the full price for a Bacon Mcdouble When I got to the window I clarified again but was told they didnt have that in their system and that I had to pay the full price for the Bacon Mcdouble I asked ro talk to the manager who then told me they didnt have what I ordered I told him to go out and check his menu because it was on there He told me he didnt need to that it was not on the menu He was very rude and dismissive I realize it is just a few cents difference but why should anyone pay for something they didnt order especially if what you ordered is on the menu I see no reason to be treated so unprofessionally and rudely I dont recommend visiting this McDonalds luckily there are plenty of others near by who treat people with respect

Avoid the drive thru at all costs This was not the first time and we should have stopped and checked the order

22231,1,Definitely seems par for the course in the new Hawaii Service was horrible Staff acts like youre asking them to pull their teeth out when you try to give an order Asked for 2 sundaes got 1 Asked for bbq sauce got 1 Asked for a second d one and they acted as if they take it out of her check Seems the Aloha of Hawaii is melting away fast from their local businesses Fries taste like fish very disappointing
22230,1,This isnt the typical cosy McDonalds When handing over the ice cream corn my wife did not catch well and dropped it on the counter Although the server gave us another one he didnt show the pleasure face but some madness in his face Definitely not the McDonalds I knew
16428,1,Had a terrible experience from start to finish An order taker in the drive thru even though there was not a back up he interrupted my ordering got it wrongi corrected him the cashier had it wrongi corrected him then they handed me the wrong order then the fish sandwich was burnt and tasted old and the chicken nuggets tasted like very bad chicken Worst McDonalds experience ever
16429,1,I asked for a peppermint mocha and all was well until I realized the hot cup they served it in was cold by the time it was too late and I was already home Drive thru service not the best when you have to yell out the order multiple times
22228,1,During our stay in Waikiki We always order for our boys happy meals With each purchase only 1 ranch was placed in 1 happy mealWhen we asked for the other happy meal we were told that is 1 ranch per customer no matter how many happy meals you buy We went back and purchased the two happy meals separately to get 1 ranch in each box

16382,1,All I ordered was 2 mcribs for 6 drivethru They asked me to pull into parking lot and wait Ended up waiting 25 minutes before I got my order They claimed the manager couldnt find me It is a very small parking lot The manager didnt try very hard I ended up calling them to remind them about my order They came out with the same mcribs and handed them to me by this time the were slightly warm and very soggy The only explanation I got was were so sorry I just left immediately otherwise I would have lost my cool if I stayed Ended up just throwing my order away after one bite Lost my appetite

22251,1,The manager Wesley shouldnt be leading a team the young guy obviously has lots to learn about customer service manners and common courtesy We walked up to the counter where he was standing Right when we were about to ask to order he simply walked away quickly without giving us any acknowledgement or finding someone else to help us in lieu

Also You want to charge 050 for tap water Never heard of a McDs charging for a cup of tap water before"

30927,1,Slow Manager Melissa not smart with cash register as other employees so sad Waste of time
16514,1,It appears this location burned down or was leveled for reconstruction  There is no building only steel support beams and a fence around the lot
22180,1,The day manager was aweful We were staying at the Alohilani Resort and decided we just want a simple lunch  We ordered a Mc nugget meal 2 fish sandwiches and two pies  The pies were reason we went there  I got back to the hotel realized they werent there Went back she assured me she put 1 pie in the bag I go back to the hotel find the reciept and my husband ordered two pies  Instead of apologizing for error she said next time bring back the whole bag of food  Obviously she knows nothing about the Aloha spirit which is prevalent all around the rest of the island
22175,1,No bathroom what McDonalds has no bathrooms Clearly an anti homeless measure Instead of punishing the homeless maybe the city should search for a solution and all the wealthy businesses of the area should contribute instead of sucking the city dry

22159,1,This is an ideal location across from Waikiki Beach the tourist destination however is infested with homeless protected by the local police Our drinks were stolen from our table as my children sat and waited for my wife and I to retrieve our order We called a manager to pull video surveillance which showed exactly which homeless person stole our drinks and called the police to file a theft report The local police were completely useless did not press any charges despite video footage sided with the homeless thief and said if they arrested him that a thousand more would do the same thing Really I received zero apologies or compensation from McDonalds the police I called or the thief in the photo In fact the police apologized to the homeless thief for bothering him prior to leaving The homeless thief remained in the restaurant We will never eat here again despite the fact that we 
30940,1,What a nightmare Lost our order gave it to someone else and then my iced coffee had no vanilla in it  Ugh

3500,1,Horrible service
16302,1,Cant believe this place is brand new and the parking lot is as horrible as it is This is the worst design Ive ever seen If there are people in the DriveThru everyone in the parking lot is trapped in the parking lot no menus no front of store employees and when you do show at the counter its like the employees are scared to leave the kitchen like they have high anxiety of actually facing someone or something You can stand there at the counter forever and no one will ever come
16304,1,After sitting in the drive thru for an hour spending almost 50 asking for sauces and getting on the highway we discovered 3 missing large fries and no sauces We returned and received 3 cold fries with absolutely no salt on them Others were also complaining of incomplete orders as well

16307,1,Very disappointing after they rebuilt the whole building  It is supposed to be the most modern of Equipment and yet it was the slowest experience I have ever had at a McDonalds and only for two egg McMuffins  Then the English muffin was burnt on both sandwiches  The staff definitely did not want to be there  It is my closest McDonalds but I will definitely be driving the longer distance next time  Just avoid this spot no matter what
16310,1,It took 1 plus hours to get thru the drive thru  The drive thru is such that once in line you cannot get out No one apologised for the abnormal wait time When I got my food the fries where cold and the taste old I usually to not complain about a restaurant but 1 plus hours in a drive thru line is ludicrous Especially for a fast food establishment
22304,1,First visit service and food were good HOWEVER on returning the next day for an afternoon snack they lost our paid for order and then proceeded to QUESTION the validatin
16311,1,This place has ZERO customer service From no one being at the front counter to long waits to get food to getting your order wrong then getting cold food when they remake your order This is one McDonalds youll want to avoid going to

22291,1,Ordered  some breakfast and three extra milks never received   The three milks Lets be honest how hard is it to work at McDonald
30739,1,It says 24 hours but they were closed
30720,1,Ice cream machine is always down It makes no sense its Florida
3507,1,It sucked
22305,1,When you go to pick up a meal you tell her politeness many times She doesnt pay any attention to you at all and shes very impolite so she cant hear you How can such employees work in McDonalds

30682,1,Typical long wait Missing items apathetic employees
16272,1,Raw Chicken Nuggets served here If you want Salmonella this is the place to be They gave me a refund and kicked me out I wrote down my number but they clearly wanted to do nothing about it
16273,1,Avoid at all costs Poorly designed driveway Employees mess up order 5 out of 5 times Sent back a kids plain ketchup and cheese burger 4 times because they kept  sending out everything but what we ordered cheeseburger with ketchup only We  held up driverhru line because of incompetence Total clown show  110pm
16277,1,The worse McDonald in LA Unprofessional stuff and very unknowable manager regards to health and food handling basics After realizing that the person who was working at the fries station didnt used gloves at all and he was sticking his finger into each box he needed to fill and touched each fries in a way that is improper and already contaminated I talk to the manager to ask why the person dont  wear gloves that it is requirement in the kitchen that produce prepa
16278,1,Drive through takes forever never any parking when you decide to go inside to place your order Kiosks have been down last couple of visits and workers pay no attention to customerseven when they need to pay because of their broken kiosks not accepting payment I went inside for a soda and iced coffee and didn
3523,1,Ok
22313,1,Terrible manager tonight  Ordered two fries one was ready right away the other had to be fried and then made me wait for the other fries and gave me one cold order and one fresh  All would have been done at same time if she had paid attention to her customers
16280,1,Should have never got in the drive thru line no joke do Not come here its 1106pm been in this drive thru for over 45 minutes sta
16281,1,My order is WRONG every time the most frustrating customer experience I live near this new location and have visited 6 times since the remodel and Ive concluded that this location is a 120 mess If all of my orders are wrong I can imagine thousands of others are driving off with incorrect purchases I ask for no cheese every time and guess what is in my order CHEESE Or my frys are half full or the hashbrowns are completely missing no syrup utensils are in the bag as requested On 3 occasions we were told to pull ahead and park on the side while they remake my order an employee brings out an incorrect order yes 3 times Today this New team member blatantly tells me to go in and take of it what the hell Every other time I let the incorrect order slide but today I decided to speak with the store manager I let her know politely about all of my incorrect orders and she replies Sorry I then ask what is mcdonalds doing about this its every time the order is wrong She responds Im so sorry I ask again and same response  Meanwhile the woman next to me is asking about the replacement order that she put in ten minutes ago they apologize to her and say they are going to reinput it this new location is a joke its truly insane that a Mcdonalds is operating like this and its been a few months since their brand new building opened
30690,1,Manger was rude She got an attitude because I didnt want to order off the kiosk I wouldnt recommend this place especially if you have children
30692,1,I received half my order I went back for the other half and still so much wrong Then again what can I expect from mcds
16284,1,"They forgot half of my order when I called them back  it was drive though the girl that worked there gave me huge attitude rolled her eyes on me and shut down the window  after new moments have me my bag with NOT CORRECT ORDER still The most shocking thing was the attitude Ruined our mood Do not recommend There are plenty McDonald restaurants in the area Definitely avoiding this one

16285,1,The white guy at the drive thru was good and friendly  The reception was right But when I got my order it was wrong  I went inside to get corrected The cashier and manager had some sort of rival  gang problem Instead of walking away from the problems They all started fighting It was horrible I wont ever go back there
30696,1,They got my order wrong walked away with my debit card my food was cold  They could not speak English  Awful location
16286,1,The studio city location has the worst service of any restaurant I know of Drive thru is marginally ok but inside is chaos There are people in the kitchen who occasionally come out to the counter to reluctantly help customers No one is charge It makes me wish we had a real McDonalds nearby I left a cold order of fries on the counter because no one called out the order number Never did get my hamburger Im giving them one star because the food is fine if and when you get it
16289,1,How rude of the driver thus person that worked on 3152023 around 750pm we were wanting to get some fries and chicken nuggets and some drinks and hoping to enjoy a amazing meal from this McDonalds but we lost our appetites due to the drive thu person using a loud rude unprofessional tone the worker seemed rushed and we didnt even get our sodas due to the person being so rude Not ok

3429,1,Food   Must be hot
16358,1,It amazing how many items you can get wrong in one order Fries were double salted yet undercooked Soda wasnt what I asked for Really just bad service from the drive thru on multiple occasions  This location does not properly represent the McDonalds brand

3423,1,To many junkies and drug dealers
16360,1,Ive already written a review for this place and havent been here in a bit but this is an update The girl taking payments in the first window with glasses dark hair was rude and the nuggets I had ordered werent warm and taste as if they were sitting out for a while And to top it off they gave me an opened buffalo sauce  I can
22269,1,This place has horrendous CUSTOMER SERVICE They are SLOW RUDE DISRESPECTFUL AND THEY DISCRIMINATE Not a lot of lower cost food options in area but be aware this is what to expect
16362,1,After waiting in drive through for 20 minutes  I ordered a filet o fish and large fries with ketchup  just to get a regular size fries not even filled to the top either  and a  filet of fish with no tarter sauce  and 14 of a peice of cheese  I always check my food right then and there because this location usually messes up drive though orders  and  when I showed them  the employee gave me a attitude and rolled their eyes at me  She even tried to say the fries fell out of the box into the bag  I showed her the bag being empty and even made the comment Even no ketchup  She then said I had to pull out of the drive through to wait for my order to be fixed it would be 5 to 10 minutes since my lunch is only 30 minutes I had no choice but to leave
3419,1,So slow I missed the train

30797,1,Terrible 30 minutes in drive thru  Drink was wrong and sandwich was wrong
30799,1,I waited for an hour forn2 happy meals horrible service
16372,1,This location should have stayed closed Why do they have a reopening sign when theyre only operating for drive thru What about the pedestrians The ones who cant drive At least I was able to walk in and  order food before they remodeled I live less than a mile from here and I cant walk over and physically order food And why is there a parking lot if we cant walk in And how rude the associate was that I basically should have known better that they were only running the drive thru Youre better off going to the one on burbank Blvd Who puts a double lane on a drive thru and doesnt expect problems This isnt it McDonalds 20 minutes sitting in a drive thru
30800,1,I give ya all a 1 because all McDonalds I went and ordered a cheeseburger thy never come with mayonnaise I couldnt eat it Im very disappointed I will be be back to ya all

ok Ill punch it in so it comes out a good deal for you

Um Ok

When I got the order it ONLY had egg I politely informed the person at the drive through window but they refused to correct the order saying in a absolute terms that this is what I ordered and if I wanted what I ACTUALLY ordered Id have to get back in line and place a new order

What the hell

16322,1,"The new location is attractive
The staff member taking the orders was great but the person putting our order together gave us the wrong items
We paid for an upsize and got a lesserpriced size

Mcdonalds french fries are outstanding the rest of what they offer is oftentimes questionable"
16323,1,Dont go   Usually  meals have been sitting around getting cold and stale before being served in drive through  I even asked server to please get me fresh fries since mine were cold and her response was 
3468,1,Cold food
16324,1,Never again will I order from here 2 times ordered mistakes were made Both were using the app so was apps fault but because they were short staff they could not find time to help and fix my order Waited 20 minutes to leave with nothing and not even sure my order was canceled
16326,1,We have given this newly remodeled McDonalds a few chances The only difference is they now can jam more cars in their drive thru They will still make you pull up and wait for your order and forget that youre waiting Same problem as before Having this happen multiple times seems ridiculous and we dont even frequent this place Location is convenient but not worth it
3464,1,Serving is too late

30748,1,Waited 12 hour for only a McFlurry When it came it was wrong Suppose to have Rolos in it but only had chunks of chocolate Ill never use this McDonalds again
16336,1,Since reopening this location suck big time Cannot get anything in time the manager here is very poorly performing no people to take orders clean up or just run this place like a restaurant
16338,1,They need to change the time that they open because the door states that they open at 600 am but when ask employees what time they will be opening they stated that they don
16339,1,Um so this is not a 247 McDonalds
22281,1,Do not go here Tried 2 days in a row Did not go there Cannot get your order right Drink machine does not work
30750,1,I hated this You only could go through  the drive thru We asked if we could get something and they said no  Then A guy walks up asked for something and They give it to him wow  this is utterly ridiculous

30941,1,slow as hell
30945,1,Hours are NOT accurate
31130,1,Worst McDonald ever The workers are really rude dont know how to work take millions of year to prepare the food OR take your order and when you try to ask for basic things like drinks they treat you bad or ignore you I waited for them to give me my coke for around 15 minutes and when they finally hand it to me it was a Dr pepper guess what I waited 10 minutes more for them to have the decency to
21947,1,Flies everywhere it was disgusting
21942,1,Bad rancid smell
31131,1,After visiting with a friend quite a distance from our home this past week we stopped off at this McDonalds location to get us a late night dinner I really wanted an Oreo McFlurry and was willing to even settle for some fresh baked or classic McDonald character bag of cookies but they said that their ice cream machine was down and they were completely out of any and all cookies sad face As we pulled away from the drivethru and continued on our way to our final destination we realized that they gave us the wrong order We spent about 20 but only received maybe 5 worth of food The lobby was closed the line was long and we were too tired to turn back I tried calling this location more than 3 times and even submitted a complainthelp request via the McDonalds app to try and get some sort of resolution to their mistake yet I still have notignoring all of my attempts
16773,1,Drive thru too slow
3033,1,Very good and efficient The problem is that the third floor is always close at the hours of 7 pm till all night And its difficult to find a seat I dont understand why you would build a McDonalds with a floor that you hardly used Plus some of the security are rude to the costumers other then that service is very good
31135,1,They have destroyed their animal themed building and now its boring Not worth going to anymore Why are McDonalds creating such boring buildings What a waste of money It doesnt make sense Its as if they are deliberately trying to lose money and encourage people to stay away
31137,1,"1st time today I Asked for  cappuccino without sugar they gave with sugar

31140,1,We bought food and drinks with the kids After playing in the play place we tried to get refills on our sodas and were told they do not offer refills and we would have to buy another There were no signs or anything stating such and Ive never seen another McDonalds telling people this so Im pretty sure the worker just lied to us
16764,1,horrible service fire the bitch
31141,1,Worst McDonalds ever sat in the drive thru 2  for over 10 minutes while the first drive thru the orders were being attended and the second drive thru was ignore and I finally drove up to place the order and my order was wrong like always worst experience ever bad management

21924,1,Not fresh food
3017,1,Wanted to try their new crispy chicken sandwich on a potato roll  was so disappointed I expected crispy but what u got was a burnt piece of chicken you could barely bite into you could tell the same piece had been cooked several times that day It was disgusting that they even served it to me like that I took 2 bites  it went directly in the trash
31147,1,BE AWARE  There was a MAN that looked weird He asked me for money and my boyfriend for a cigarette then he wouldnt leave us ALONE until I said I was calling the copsThe place is cool because of the decorations but  1 The burger was greasy disgusting 2 French fries NOT fully cooked 3 One of the workers was not even wearing an hat 4 She messed up the order and behind me there was another Lady mad due to a wrong order
3015,1,Staff is slow and rude restrooms are not available
31148,1,If you want to watch employees fight and spend a half a hour waiting on fries and a Frappe this is the McDonalds for you Service between 5  6 am horrible and the 10pm line is backed up onto Ewing Ave Very Childish and unpleasant employees

As Im writing this I noticed there is a wrapper glued to my shoe   The only nice person was the homeless lady sitting in the corner

Dont eat here unless you want to get Ebola"
31127,1,Unreal this mcdonalds is garbage It was cool when it had zoo themed but came back home to visit to find my favorite mcdonalds right off the highway near the new tarnished Service is always lackluster at best and usually can be very messy inside since the remodel
31103,1,The milkshake was melted and watered down and the staff seemed annoyed when I asked for a refund
16714,1,The burger looked nothing like the pictures
16716,1,"The burgers just keeps getting smaller and smaller
And the price higher and higher"

I wont be coming back here again at least until my Spanish is better"
3058,1,NEVER GO HERE  HORRIBLE SERVICE Theyre always rude Either theyre RACIST or just plain rude I asked for a paper bag 3 times and the two Spanish ladies ignored me despite making eye contact The one at the pick up counter gave a little nod then walked away even though the paper bags were right next to her Then I went to the cashier and she just gave me a blank look and motioned to the pickup counter without saying a word Then I told the girl yet again that I need a paper bag please and she just gave me a dumbfounded look with a twang of annoyance and walked away and then fave out more orders They were just so rude and every other time Ive been there They were all Spanish and maybe dont like Asians but theyre horrible people and I never want to go to this location ever again

16741,1,"MAKE AMERICA FAT AGAIN



Oh I forgot America is already obese"
31120,1,Cold Fries missing food wrong food and no receipt for proof of purchase This location just opened not that long ago and lack of detail on orders given is already a huge problem If you want good reviews then pay attention to the people ordering your food I ran a McDonalds so I know what was not done and the leadership and crew members need work on actually doing what they are both taught and paid to do
31122,1,We usually always go before the zoo because it was cutely decorated to the zoo theme and the kids enjoy the experience Service has always been meh but the atmosphere made up for it Now its just a boring modern McDonalds with bleh service The remodel was a mistake and if youre going to take away the only appealing part of the place at least make sure the service improves Probably wont come back during our zoo trips anymore 
16752,1,The workers are no help and are rude
3048,1,"Never have I ever seen an employee THAT lost for real and I used to work at McDonalds so I saw some madness but here We were there at 9pm today in case any manager wants to speak with the girl I had to deal with she is wearing glasses and was the one delivering the orders We ordered 2 menus 2 shakes and a sundae The waiting wasnt long at all She calls us and give us the sundae then move along Im waiting and she looks at me like what are you waiting for well the rest of my order Becky i didnt pay 30 for a sundae

31162,1,Normally every experience Ive had at this location has gone smoothly but unfortunately this Sunday when my family and I arrived the employees werent in the best mood Rushing thru my order and taking it in correctly missing items that were not even on my receipt had to get in line again The staff very unwilling to help over hearing a conversation with another customer a Hispanic father and young daughter trying to pick up a order and knowing very little English the employee being rude and acting like she couldnt understand Just plain old being disrespectful that my husband had t
2998,1,This McDonalds has a sign posted open 24hrs but at 110 am they had ppl waiting outside with the doors close Its cold and the staff is very unprofessional I doubt the corporate office knows about this
2997,1,Really slowwwwwwwww action and no service at all
31163,1,Apparently when ordering counter pickup after 9 or 10 they dont allow you to and gotta go through drivethrough
31164,1,Worst thing here at this location is ordering from the app an waiting for your order over 20 minutes now they need to get better service
31165,1,"The App lets you order breakfast and pay ahead but when you show up and its 1003 their system wont let them complete your order

The location is relatively good the employees are always friend and fast

But someone needs to pass along yo the corporate officeapp devs and need to either decide to

1 prepare prepaid breakfast orders and have them ready before the 1000 shut off or

2 allow them to prepare my prepaid breakfast order 3 minutes after its no longer breakfast time

I do not want to eat a burger as my first meal of the day at 1003 on the way to work"
2993,1,The place wasnt clean 4 seats upstairs closedno place to sit
31166,1,Horrible costumer service the lady taking my order never even talked to me I even told her thank you after she had taken my order to be polite and she just turned around she filled the fries I didnt even care to complain but as u can tell from the picture I would have got more out of a small at most mcdonalds

2979,1,At 234 pm 1222023 the manager working there with the mole on her face made very racist remarks behind their back to the customers ahead of us and was very rude to me and my wife when asked for an extra straw since the paper straws never last Disgusting behavior and attitude coming from a manager 010 would not recommend
2978,1,"Most of the staff were nice but what peeves me is the quality of drinks
The coca cola needs to be calibrated correctly  more syrup BUT THE ICED TEA TASTED LIKE COFFEE
After i walked all that way for take home
As a stockholder I LOVE MCDONALDSbut not today"
31177,1,"So I got to this location frequently despite hearing the horror stories about this location because it is close to me Well tonight my order was messed up and they yelled at me about it
First I tell the person taking my order that I would like a Bacon Double Quarter Pounder w Cheese Tea for the drink make the combo a large So the first thing we have a discussion about is that he gave me an unsweetened tea on the screen I tell him I would like a sweet tea for the drink and he tells me that I ordered it wrong I said Well normally when I come here they default to sweet tea I said that because they usually do  He said Nah Thats not how we do it Then he clears the entire order and puts in a Quarter Pounder with Cheese

I tell him that I ordered a Bacon Double Quarter with Cheese sweet tea and make the combo a large I saw that it was not right on the screen but he repeated the order to me correctly  I pulled around to pay for the order and waited on it to be served to me I checked the order and told the person at the window that it was not a double The person at the window talked to the person who took my order and he came to the window and yelled I MADE WHAT YOU ORDERED I told him that I said double several times when I ordered 5 times to be exact He person who took my order who looked to be a manager yelled at me NO IT WAS THE WAY YOU ORDERED IT YOU ASKED FOR A SINGLE

I repeated that I asked for a Bacon Double Quarter with cheese and he started arguing with me about how to order sweet tea He finally told me that he would make it order but I did not trust him at this point so I said that I was leaving and I would not be back

This was an awful experience and I will not be back I will also tell my friends and family to avoid this location despite that it has served our community over 10 years"

2972,1,Thursday at 256 am I went in here to order A very unfriendly and rude guard sits table and he says Yo close yo close However two other customers were ordering using the kiosk I tried to argue with him but I just left because I didnt want to talk to a rude person McDonalds is a big company If they have cleaning hours they must notify Google This early hour should not cause customers to walk in vain to this place They are wasting their customers time and are not considerate Because of these little things McDonalds image

Overall very unorganized and chaotic service A very loud crowded and dirty location with no bathrooms

22343,1,I went late at night at 3am and I guess their registers were being counted or something so they manually calculated everyones order at the time  All in all this one cashier is a complete idiot she gave me the wrong change even after I corrected her but she didnt care  Had to speak to another employee and then the manager to get my correct change  4 people with similar orders received their orders before I did and then again I had to bring it up for them to realize Ive been waiting  Worst experience ever and never going to that cashier again
30650,1,Even with me using the screen computer to place my order they still get the order wrong wow really

Food was a real disappoint asked for extra bacon and remove stuff but when I got back to our place to eat it was just the default of what the burger was

Sorry would give more but place needs as little work it could be understaffed idk but its could be alot better"
3579,1,Very poor McDonalds in terms of service and friendliness Could only get food in a bag Long wait and no overview in the numbers of the orders We were 5 people and a large part of the order was missing Fortunately that was quickly arranged after having to wait again Apparently upstairs where you can sit closed at 8 pm Fifteen minutes before a lady came to report that they were closing She kept holding the door open until everyone had actually left After 5 minutes we also left and the rest were able to eat in the rain Something is seriously wrong there
3620,1,Horrible the hamburger does not taste like anything I like Burger King better

Tonight I had dinner at McDonalds at Kalakaua  Liluokalani at approximately 950 pm Hawaiian time I purchased 2 Fillet burgers a small French fry and a senior small coffee
After finishing I TRIED to receive a medium Mocha frapp According to Your McDonalds app I could get a FREE medium cafe without a purchase I had received a FREE one before One of your manager Diana assisted a clerk as she encountered a problem On your screen it had mentioned with purchase whereas Your app noted FREE Diana asked me to wait till 11 pm when another manager was scheduled to come in Crazy She wanted to wait After a few exchanges of options to her as I got aggravated She said I can call 911 What What type of training do YOU McDonalds Corporation of America PROVIDE or HAWAII  I have complained so many times it is not funny To avoid lawsuits better training is uhio McDonalds

14358,2,Much They always get my order wrong
13574,2,My experience visiting this place was not good It was not because the place that is a nice building with many things to do specially for kids but for the service This McDonalds offers Pasta and Pizza and I had the terrible idea of order a pizza along with many other things I have to wait more then an hour and 15 minutes for it  The place was plenty of tourists many of them in groups like mine and most of them had the same problem The staff attention was not good They were overwhelmed and didnt warning about the long waiting time In some cases one hour and a half This is considered the largest McDonalds in the World so it is another tourist attraction in the city They should improve their service especially in the pizza area As a positive comment I received a second ration of one of my orders for free in retribution for the long wait My recomendation is not to order pizza if you are in a hurry with a large group and during busy times
14360,2,IT is ALLWAYS hotter than any other arch weve ever visited IN  Surrounding towns
19824,2,They leave you waiting

19271,2,Its absurd how bad the service is here I wouldnt recommend going through the drive through Theyll mess up your order and then make you wait a long time for it again Id say just ignore this McDonalds entirely but if you do come to this location do yourself a favor Park the car and order your meal inside the fast food restaurant Itll be faster this way

16555,2,There is an entrance fee upon entering and exiting the drive thru LOL
19038,2,Poor 
19293,2,"This McDonalds has always been bottomofthebarrel as far back as I can remember and a sleek facelift doesnt change the fact that a visit to this McDonalds will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth The list of their offenses is too long to detail every one so Ill compile a list
1 Incorrect orders 50 of the time
2 Rude employees and managers
3 Customers who are loud offensive and downright violent
4 Poorly made slappedtogether food

And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company PBS Parking Boot Service and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand 200 cash in exchange for the boot removal It seems this McDonalds is doing everything to lose business They thrive off of convenient location alone Absolutely terrible experience"
24520,2,The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok She then gave me a 10 piece nugget instead of 6 I dont know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold I felt so bad because my son bit into them and was so disappointed Although I was less than a minute away I refused to go back because I felt that was done spitefully  Usually go to this location at least 4 times but will NEVER return and encourage any one I know to skip this location

18037,2,Poor 
13627,2,Went on a Thursday so it wasnt overwhelmingly busy but still busy enough that there were lines to the kiosks  people wandering to find a cash register employee Wait time was not bad Food came in probably 15 mins We stayed downstairs to receive our trays at the counter I could see how there would be an issue if you went upstairs to sit  waited for an employee to come find you The girl who brought our food was very very nice We received our pastas first even though we ordered the pizza first so I have a feeling it was just sauce pots sitting on warmers to dump quick dishes Not sure why other comments say their pasta took long Our pizza came out fine Really not worth the money but we went for the experience you get what you get in Orlando standard happy meal was 8 and pasta meals were 15 for a smallish portion of pasta with a McChicken thrown on top
21620,2,Homeless

The blue shirt manager   last name begin with an A on duty Had a serious attitude  She did not acknowledge my order so she gave me the wrong order She gave me a bag with a sandwich and hash brown and walk away as if that was my order I sat there until she saw me and I told her I am waiting for my coffee  She said the there is no coffee on the order I showed her the receipt and she walk on to the coffee and gave to me Now I was going to let everything go until I heard her say these words after asking for napkin to wipe the chocolate OFF THE CUP  Which is her job 
Her Words loud and clear
FOR GOD SAKE
I know I only spent a few dollars but IT dont justify getting attitude because this is your job
I ask for a refund"
16675,2,there was a hair in our food
25131,2,6yyyyy
19272,2,Really bad service Food was cold And large fries wasnt even full Probably size of a medium Have to do better
19278,2,Too much waiting seems like the staffs dont know how a fast food restaurant suppose to be run On top of the wait they forget items that you pay for so make sure to ask for a receipt if something not right with this McDonalds please report it call and complain
13017,2,Full of homeless people not like Im unaware of our global situation with homelessness but if you looking to sit down chill and eat dont do it at this one It doesnt have a drive thru so order ahead for pick up it does have self service ordering kiosk
22563,2,Me and wife both have food poisoning from this McDonalds Thats the only food we ate that day so it cant be anything else
24516,2,Just went through the drive thru and literally was in line for about 20 mins start to finish For being a fast food they are super slow They are in the heart of Orland and do not do a good job My French fries were cold One of my kids drink was empty and the cookies I ordered were completely wrong I would suggest going to q near by restaurant which they have faster service than these people

20843,2,Poor 
11023,2,Be careful they will only let you buy large meals at night time But serve medium not many notice because theyre drunk
19289,2,Its my local McDonalds so I wish I could rate it higher especially considering they added modern stuff like the DIY menu boards and the 2nd drive thru lane But whats the point of a second drive thru lane if your employees just ignore it like what happened tonight Also while they have security inside the pan handlers in the drive thru lanes at night are out of control Food wise things take a long time usually but its your normal McDonalds type food except they dont salt their fries well
14600,2,Its McDonalds
16681,2,Ok food service 0 and prices difference from all other
16156,2,Poor

22113,2,Its McDonalds
19693,2,Slow service
24136,2,didnt give it 1 star because the food was good but around 4 days ago i went at night through the drive thru and I gave my McDonalds app code to get the points i ordered something that was 15 dollars in total and they charged me 31 dollars and the reason for this was that the guy that was taking care of the drive thru applied my McDonalds app code to another car order my card is linked to the app  and I ended up paying for their food i know this because they guy asked my name and when I told him he said something to the manager and I said yeah I think that car  is using my code  the guy just said  is your lucky day go to the next window   It was late at night so I didnt give it much thought because I didnt know just by giving your code you can get charged  but next day I got surprised when my account got charged twice Tried calling but they didnt solve my issue this is why I am leaving a review

24487,2,"I tried to use a coupon to get a free medium fries from the Mcdonald app along with my other items i purchased and after the scanned the coupon they gave me small fries I even heard them making comments about the free coupon Also the women at the window seem to be fooling around too much hence the extremely long line during lunch and dinner times I stopped by 4 times in one week and had an issue each time

The young white guy at the first window is really nice though hence the 2 stars instead of 1"
13091,2,Manager sucks I called her over for help and she ignored me Seating arrangements are disorganized The soda fountain machine is always dirty Hardly any ice When you press for a certain soda it runs water for a while Too many homeless people The only decent thing here is the food
15950,2,Slow and always out of things
23490,2,FOOD  WAS MEDIOCRE The service slow and unfriendly
22587,2,One worker wasn
24140,2,2 adults ww children breakfast meals Had to go back to service counter 3 times no eggs in meal Then again hole in cup hot water everywhere Then tea bag had hole in so back to counter Food was cold by time we all sat down to eat No apologies were given
13090,2,They allow the homeless to beg in front of their door and people buy them food so they go inside and eat The problem is their smell We bring our tourists families and end up totally embarrassed
24115,2,Good iced tea
15481,2,Lobby is closed often for seemingly unknown reasons
13444,2,THE LOCATION IS A DRUG DEN RIGHT UNDER THE STAFFS NOSE SECURITY IS A JOKE THE CHOPPY ENGLISH OF THE MORNING MCDONALDS FRONT LINE AND THE SECURITY STAFF LOOK LIKE AGING GANG MEMBERS
14458,2,Got my order wrong twice
22423,2,Well it is typical McDonalds nothing more nothing less However the location run out of large size cup for soda only had medium or small which I really wanted the large one because I was planning to head to a  beach to eat my lunch so I was already disappointed at this point but well things happens so I just let it go Then I pour sprite grabbed the burgers walked to the beach and finds out that my sprite didnt have any syrop so pure club soda that was so sad
15454,2,The drive through was backed up it literally took about 15 mins before I got up to the speaker After another 15 mins of sitting in line I finally got my food My cup of tea had more ice than tea and my friends were extremely hard im not sure if they were sitting there and got dropped back in the grease or if they were just cooked way too long
17751,2,Poor 
15462,2,Nicer now that its been remodeled but I dont know why they got rid of the kids play area I dined in today and my food took a long time The chicken in my salad was not good had tough pieces I ate half and threw the rest out The manager was super nice with exchanging my sons toy though
23488,2,Only gave me part of the food that I ordered them the manager gave me attitude they werent remorseful for messing up my order at all
23465,2,This is my third time visiting this store horrible place to eat all the 3 person at the service desk did not even eye contact with me and after food ready they just damp my order on the desk and I had to asked one gentleman if that was my order then he said  yes horrible place will not recommend it
19128,2,Poor 
19743,2,Slow
14427,2,Slow service and as normal my order was wrong
25002,2,Communication can be an issue English is not the first language for a lot of their employees
18132,2,Poor 
19748,2,Pancakes delicious
15466,2,Went through drive thru ordered a quarter pounder meal with out cheese  Was told only had can drinks Ok asked for a diet soda I was told that they only have can drinks and water Ok so I said water Then after I got my receipt and proceeded to next window I  looked at the receipt  and I was upcharged 39 for the water What the heck So I asked the employee at the window wht was I uocharged 39 cents for the water She said  I dont know thats all we got I  understand that the soda machines are down but to offer can drinks and water but uocharge and not told why or an employee to make the effort to explain or even care Terrible customer service Disappointed
24479,2,All that technology and they cant remember how to put two sandwiches in a bag Maybe if they had a few more people instead of LCD screens
24646,2,Order is wrong everytime i have went or missing items
24996,2,Fast Food Right spent 10 minutes waiting for a simple order
14417,2,Orders are always wrong double check
21154,2,"The lady that served us un very unwelcoming grunt at me then at my wife when asked for the key to open toilet

Hash brown was cold pancakes were hard and cold hot chocolate luke warm no lights were in outside the building  altogether a very disappointing visit"
11987,2,They force you to order from a kiosk while employees just stand around  In fact the busiest person there was the one telling people to use the kiosks to order  I had to ask three times for my drink cup
23477,2,"Curbside is a joke
Waited for 15 mins should just go through the drive thru"
15469,2,This is one of the worst McDs around Ive only been there twice in maybe a year but both experiences were far less than stellar For starters the smell coming thru the window was awful On todays visit  apparently the person in front of me claimed my order and the cashier didnt handle it well She kept yelling to the front that the lady paid for the wrong order 3 less like she didnt notice and it took her about 5 min to straighten it all out Skip this one and move on to the next one down the road
14423,2,They need to improve on their listening skills
24143,2,Went through the drivethru and had a preorder They rushed us through they were busy then when we took a bite we found out that the Sandwiches were completely wrong Not even worth going back for Its happened multiple times at this location
21513,2,Worse McDonalds on the strip dirty an employees have a attitude
20719,2,McDonalds Sucks
13438,2,Terrible fries Only thing i ever order yet they couldnt do it correctly They had one job So sad
11993,2,Was ok food usually gets messed up and sometimes not so tasty at this McDonalds I used to go their all the time when I first moved up here but every single time I went their messed my order up and the food was mostly gross some is ok but not as good as other McDonalds
24638,2,The employees are nice location is always dirty Tables have to be clean more often The food quality has gotten better
14403,2,Only car in the drive thru and it took 10 minutes for my food
19708,2,Good
20718,2,Its McDonalds
19709,2,Poor service
21155,2,The staff was polite but absolutely everything else about the experience was awful My simple order had multiple mistakes and there seem to be an almost comical line of people who were missing hash browns from their orders The entire dining room was disgusting  Not that its their fault but there was a homeless man in front of the store that looked to be on the verge of vomiting and or dying   This was like 800 am on a tuesday so I assumed they were short staffed if it was that dirty at that hour One of my two sandwiches and both of my hash browns once I visually got them were good
19710,2,Service suck
21524,2,This place so deserted  Imwondering if people really come to buy food
22588,2,If you give McDonald
12742,2,Crowded and service not very good They gave me the wrong drink and no ketchup for my fries
19143,2,Poor 
19770,2,Its McDonalds
23460,2,The only thing worse than the service was the food My wifes Big Mac tasted like it had been dropped in an ashtray
21523,2,Coffee was not good Pls start serving machine coffees
14436,2,Poor quality food was served day visited
23431,2,Standard food Fast service Cash only at night More expensive than other McDs
11092,2,This location in Miami is horrible  Ordered a Quarter Pounder and it came back twice under cooked Not friendly at all
19181,2,"The worst Attitudes Cold friestwice The clerk gave the cleaning guy my order in the middle of him sweeping the floor to bring to my car Unsanitary
2nd timethe order was still wrong
Food wasnt good at all Wont be going back"
16633,2,Typical McDonalds just with REALLLLLLLY long drivethru lines Nothing special nothing to write home about
24254,2,MacDonalds use to be a fast and friendly palace to order food what a disappointing restaurant with service and attitude
19793,2,The menus are not very good and expensive very different from those in France in terms of taste and cooking of food
21573,2,Very very slow but the food was good
13048,2,Had to go and wipe my 5 star review and turn it to a 2 star since last year this whole place has turned into yet another slow Hispanic ran restaurant Used to have a diverse staff and be consistently speedy and hot now it takes 10 mins with no one else in line to get some fries and nuggets while everyone is standing around twiddling their thumbs Ive been here at least 60 times and every time Ive been here post COVID reopening its been this same situation with the change of the whole employee personnel now it
21569,2,The last 3 times Ive been here before work I sat in the drive threw for no less than 10 minutes
23392,2,I dont understand because mc Donald is a fast food place and I go thru the drive thru and  the tell me that I have to wait in one of the parking spots in stead of grab and like any normal fast food
11117,2,Half the kiosk machines where down and crowd control was missing Someone out front directing people and helping at the kiosks would have made a very different experience
15488,2,The times have gone there they are always super backed up I try to add something at the window Im paying and they tell me to go around and go through a big line for a single item after waiting for like 30 mintues Also when I ask for a frappe they tell me they are not selling them right now just because they dont want to deal with more people waiting They need to get more people to work of they dont like to keep people waiting
12161,2,Very poor service here Takes along time get your what you order
24111,2,Fun times
13098,2,I expect crowding because its close to the beach The ice machine is always out they dont have enough fresh brewed tea to refill the container and some of the employees have attitude The security guard tends to trip but its not always the same guard Service is pretty fast considering the volume of customers I only go there because of proximity
16632,2,Small place recomended for drive thru or take out
23402,2,Slow service got orders wrong but still kept people waiting while rest of their food went cold worst mc donalds Ive been to for service
16631,2,Disgusting I love McDonalds but some franchises dont know how to cook the food and this is one of them
19087,2,Poor 
13049,2,Its a McDonalds that food is the same as every other McDonalds is decent didnt like the place because it was too crowded too messy and took forever just to get a soda or no people were nice workers were nice
22087,2,Cold FFries
19212,2,One of the worst with service I ordered a ice latte through the app for pickup So I go inside I wait at pickup Drink isnt ready and other people are waiting also I mentioned to the solo employee I had a pickup order She says ok then goes off to make other peoples meals So I try to be patient stood there for like 20min and never received my drink They never canceled my drink I left and was still charged for it Also they never sent the 1 cashier who was struggling by herself no help
12184,2,Got told I couldnt find in and everyone else was dining in
19681,2,FOOD ALWAYS COLD 
19077,2,Poor 
13041,2,"Order was screwed up and the hash browns in both combo meals were barely cooked to just above raw
Amazing their staff could screw up two breakfast meals in the same order in an automated process SAD"
16638,2,Unorganized Couldn
21582,2,The cashier was rude and got bothered by me asking to put lettuce in my burger they need a customer service counselling 
20813,2,Poor 
23481,2,Always a long wait today it took 35 min in drive through most times around 15 min but like their ice tea so but up with it
16634,2,Really long SLOW line at the drive through Took FOREVER
15426,2,Fast service but please dont confuse them theyre on auto mode
11070,2,Most forgot they are working in customer service They talk to people as if they are doing them a favor instead of were helping each other
16137,2,Poor 
19216,2,"Fries soggy most of the time
Soda gets bad constantly Gave me seltzer water instead of soda
Sandwiches not bad except that theyre dry sometimes
Customer service anything else After every single request instead of would you care to try our new "
22816,2,Complicated kiosk ordering salty fries can order lightly salted decent but too much sodium in the hamburgers  Good for in a pinch or for a quick bite
16152,2,Poor 
13100,2,No Refills  It took about 10 minutes for me and everyone else in line to get their order done They could only give you 3 ranch for 20 Chicken Nuggets not even 4 Fo
23386,2,They can not get any order right My order took 3 remakes and finally I had to go in to the restaurant after placing my original order in the drive thru
18162,2,Poor 
18164,2,"Perhaps the most poorly run McDonalds in Texas Visited on the weekend  so naturally busier but the management attitude of employees and physical condition make this a location in my opinion the worst location weve ever visited
1 Trash everywhere see pic for example Trash on the floors tables parking lot
2 Dirty tables Obviously tables get dirty So we asked if a team member could wipe down a table to remove ketchup and prior visitors"
12778,2,Service was extremely slow  and order was incorrect  Employee that gave me the order was very nice and corrected the order
16138,2,Poor 
24112,2,Dirty and slow service
16618,2,Not good for health as we all know but a little good food
18095,2,Poor 
19782,2,I dont like it very much because whenever you order something they measure what it is not
24144,2,It was a clean and convenient location but we were quite disappointed with the service and food we ordered  We clearly specified using the McDonalds app that we wanted a quarter pounder no mustard no pickles no onions  We received a fully loaded quarter pounder  AND when the lady delivered our app order to our car she intentionally stopped far enough so we had to reach backwards to get her food  She made no effort to offer the food  She made us get it where she was  McDonalds needs to review procedures with the staff and seek to improve the customer experience there
20769,2,Poor 
16613,2,My cup was fingered by the cashier   Two stars because he gave a new one when I asked
24146,2,They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to navigate They are not very intuitive at all My order took three times as long to be brought out Good idea on the kiosks but very poor execution While I was waiting on my order they had to come and tell two different people that they were out of what they ordered fish sandwich and something else Store was newly renovated inside and out and looked very nice but I will not be back
21548,2,Orders were messed up and it took to long to get the food for a FAST food restaurant
21546,2,The people that work there were very nice and helpful
17179,2,Poor 
22416,2,Front desk was rude 30 mins from order to get food Typical for Waikiki
22106,2,Its McDonalds
23425,2,The good thing is that is open 24 They do not have enough personnel Food was just okay help us survive till the next morning
19182,2,Incorrect hours  I arrived at 552 in the morning and was informed that they still closed
11091,2,Pretty much every employee here is unhelpful and clearly unhappy My order is wrong every time
24262,2,Granted we at a busy time of the evening SeaWorld was getting ready to close but the lobby to thus McDonalds was locked even though all the signs clearly indicated they were supposed to be open for lobby hours The drivethru was open but it was exceedingly slow The service was poor and the products we ordered were subpar even for McDonalds standards which is saying something We ended up just throwing some of it away I typically do not leave negative reviews I am hoping that they were just shortstaffed the night we went
24148,2,Atmosphere is cool and unique Ordered pasta and cheesesteaks The wait time was forever service was definitely slow But it was also Easter and spring break weekend But what was odd was that we got our cheesesteaks and waited an extra 30 minutes for our fries and milkshakes That was weird and frustrating
24491,2,Soda machine on drive thru window was broken on 12012018 at  around 1030pm The person who was taking the order was kind enough to give me the option to go inside with the cup and use the machine inside but his manager told him he could not offer me that option therefore I was unable to buy a soda Great Management Skills
23507,2,Dirty unkind too long waiting time too high work load with minimum of employees
23408,2,Usally the location I visit is on the money both with over allservice and cleanses how ever this particular day the place was a total mess and service was horrible when it should not have been because it wasnt busy
13056,2,The locations looks great and has 8 of machines that allow you to order and pay but the service was horrible I ordered a sundae for my mom and after 10 minutes of waiting I saw one employee feel a tear in her pants below her butt and then she went and fixed herself a sundae and left At this same moment another came up and asked about the sundaes for his family that he ordered 20 minutes prior I was given a refund without fuss before leaving The bad part to all of this was there were about 12 people working at the location during my visit which was more than enough to prepare and delivery the food quickly
24992,2,They had posted they would be open until 12 on Christmas Eve They were closed at 9
18086,2,Poor 
15439,2,I was in the first Lane drivethru and there were more cars on the second lane drivethru and they got their orders before I got my order placed and it was really bad the service Finally I was able to go through the lane place my order but they did not have it ready when I got up to the window so I had to wait about 1520 minutes in the parking lot for my order
11082,2,Legit almost just got robbed here would not suggest going at night even if your with the homies
22583,2,They are unprepared to handle a crowd long wait and food was cold
21502,2,One of the girls was rude was standing there by cash register for 3 minutes before she said go to the kiosk machine I asked why I couldnt order there she said its not my drawer in a rude way
21556,2,Really slow service have to wait almost 15 minutes for my order
24994,2,Their menu board was malfunctioning I didnt remember how bad their coffee is
19194,2,I went through one of the drive thru lanes last night and waited for about 15 minutes as they only took orders from the other lane I was not able to back up my car so I went forward to ask what was up When I got to the only window open they said they were only taking orders from one side I suggested they put up a sign and asked if could take my order at the window they said I would have to go through the drive thru again I am not going here anymore for this in addition to the times they got my order wrong
17169,2,Poor 
14489,2,"Earthworm burgers
"
25620,2,Restaurant very dirty trashcans were full the whole hour I was there No one even wiped down a table Sad to see there is no pride in anything
22454,2,There was a homeless guy in the restaurant that was being very vulgar  It did not make for a pleasant meal  The apple pies here are great
20708,2,Slow service
23416,2,Ordered 2 double fish fillet sandwiches and got 1 double and 1 single Order must be checked and double checked for Togo Im not coming back to change the order after few miles
23423,2,They messed up the order after explaining a few times of what we wanted and had hair in both of my egg McMuffins
12989,2,this McDonalds is more expensive than others in the area and be warned that individuals in their garage are very sensitive to the fact if you have your phone out and become vocallyworried that you are taking pictures or video of them
23304,2,Never once have I gotten my coffee done right Cream in sugar out I got 35 cream in my bag It was 8 cream in I got no sugar Crazy
22510,2,Sign on table said cleaned and sanitized when the table had a brown coffee cup stain and other dirt Yuck
12933,2,I always take long And always mess up on your orders
23045,2,Only go here because its open late Food not always the same presentation or great tastingbut it is McDonalds What do you expect You know when you go there what youre getting Cheap foodpoor customer service And maybe your order correct
24230,2,Could only order from kiosk Wanted some extras but serving staff struggled with English
21759,2,Lady sounded like she hated her job
21756,2,Ok quick simple not friendly
23042,2,Female cashier was rude and was very unprofessional If you are a tourist and dont know when it is cash only you dont get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great help I would not want the girl to serve us with that attitude
16823,2,Bad customer service
21021,2,Poor 
14842,2,Bees were all over the place could not evn reach hand out window to pay for food and then fries were cold Just terrible
21750,2,They skimped on the amount of food they served
12864,2,My Grand Big Mac was dry and the meat was hard I will not go there again
23221,2,"I visited this establishment as the kfc over the road was a let down like no other
Only pro here was that I got what I actually ordered however what a game trying to order it
The lady was not listening at all and just started adding anything and everything to my order
She was ruder then my explicit Eminem album and when I finally got to sorting out my order it was awful My chicken nuggets tasted like chewing on the chickens feet fresh out of the pen
My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not
They only gave me bbq sauces like who doesnt want ketchup 
The best thing about the meal was driving out of the establishment never to look back again

2 start because it was better then kfc"
23035,2,I should never have to wait more than 5 to 10 minutes for fast food Waiting for over 20 minutes in the line now and I still havent gotten my food I understand this is Midsummer but they knew this was coming before hand They should have the staff and the facilities to handle the business demand This McDonalds sucks

23071,2,This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonalds just down the street 20 for what is normally 10 On top of it didnt even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonalds
21032,2,Poor 
15077,2,"Drive thru was slow
"
21026,2,Poor 
23067,2,There is a theme with drive thru only restaurants cold food and watered down drinks and if dont check your bags well enough before you drive away and your order is wrong you cant just walk back inside and get it fixed you have get back in line and start all over again Open up the lobby people
12879,2,Bad service never coming back here drivetrhusuper slow

16826,2,Tables dirty
16825,2,No outlets and to crowded
23055,2,All I had was a hot fudge sundae which was good The restaurant did not have running water at the time though so I was unable to wash my hands in the bathroom or to order a soda They legally should not have been open They were still running things as usual though
14867,2,Slow service and they always forget something you ordered Very poor service
14831,2,The morning manager is rude  the Roosevelt  Central location in Chicago  I dont want her to lose her job just fix her attitude  smile more  I wait a little too long sometimes
23028,2,I stopped here yesterday for a quick breakfast on my way to work I got a bacon egg and cheese mcgriddle the hash brown and a caramel frappe I ended up with food poisoning 
15126,2,Poor customer service
23013,2,Waited in the drive thru for literally an hour If we werent trapped in line and had been able to leave we would have They didnt give us any napkins and got our order wrong The cashier said its always like this Absolutely not acceptable Especially for a McDonalds Did they forget what FAST food means
13525,2,They dont have combo items  this place is so busy
14797,2,Every time I purchase a large sweet tea its  unsweetened  when I purchase the double quarter pound sandwich its  a single please correct or I will go some where  else
12097,2,Always having to wait more the 10 to 15 mins in the drive thru
15148,2,Not good
14792,2,Mc Donalds needs to give its name a goooooo This was terrible and dry The food was room temperature  I have burgers fish sandwiches chicken sandwiches fries and drinks  It was all terrible
24601,2,Often very slow bc of the flood of people Thirty minute wait for fast food is crazy If you use the mobile app stick to drive thru I waited 30 minutes for curbside pick up and 25 minutes in lobby I recommend getting back in your car and going to ChickfilA Youll be there and back with your food before anything hap
19435,2,I buy the salad there and put in the garbage very old salad and disgusting tasty
23238,2,Didnt get anything to eat this time  because they CLOSE THE LOBBY AT 10PM Didnt go through the drivethru cause Im on a motorcycle What kind of dingus closes half their store to customers in Old Town
10885,2,"Service was absolutly shocking I have been there twice now Breakfast  Lunch and I have been served but the same ignorant girl both times Even though it is only fast food I still expect the service to outshine everything else She needs a lesson in hospitality or go and find another job that is far away from dealing with a customer face to face
The decor could do with up dating but its surroundings with the style of Miami Beach being art deco  retro makes it fit in
Food  Breakfast was great quality was great had to ask for sugar and was given 17 packets for some reason Lunch was poor no quality there cold fries and it was busy So that makes no sence

Overall  Poor Wont be going back there in a rush"
10888,2,MEH To 10th power only good thing is theyre quick Service is subpar theres never a hospitality smile towards the people theyre serving It feels like a grinder there they must have a high employee hire rate there no one gives that extra effort for the guests Thankfully theres a security guard working the dining area I know its Lincoln road and theres been a homeless and late night problem since forever getting jacked for my fries will cause a huge problem
14789,2,Bad Manager who supervise this place because they care more about the Drive thur than the Customer inside they have one Register open with 7 or 8 people in line during peak hours after 5pm
13475,2,Very dirty and bathrooms were closed Standard MD food otherwise

17888,2,Poor 
24198,2,Typical mcdonalds I guess The fries we tossed they were still frozen we watched them dump them in than scoop and fry them kinda gross Should of been tossed out entirely
23024,2,The only reason that I stoped to buy at McDonalds was because of my youngest daughter But what we experienced today put an end to it The employees at this location did not maintain an order serving  customers in the drive thru area As you noticed there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the case The associate instead of been polite talked to us in a not too pleasant tone I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up Luckily the manager was close by and had the opportunity to address the experience I hope they take this opportunity to improve their customer service skills and provide customers a much pleasant experience
14821,2,Just Mickey got a kid meal The only thing I hate about this est too many pan handlers allowed to beg in front of the doors
17899,2,Poor

23117,2,Very busy  mad customers long wait times for orders  The staff is trying their best but cant keep up  They need a new streamlined process and only one conductor
23116,2,Horrible service General manager was in the store at the time Was punishing an employee in front of everybody Shouldve been more professional and took him in the back area I waited 10 minutes no one in front of me and no one in the drive thru and my food still was not fresh Dont recommend this location unless you cant get to a different location
19519,2,They cant get the right order most of the time

21830,2,Eh smashed together and it was at a slow time

19518,2,Warm drink cold food
10830,2,Food was good service was god awful If youre selling hamburgers how can you have no ketchup or mayo packets Waited forever oh and they have the napkin police you can have 2 napkins LOL The only reason why Im giving a second star is the food was good and hot
14954,2,The food is cold and I continue to get the wrong order

21846,2,You know if you like it
10818,2,At this particular McDonalds  Washington st South BeachMiami The place is busy while the employees are moving around super slowly to get the orders prepared so the wait was a long for a McDonalds Otherwise no complaints
23152,2,For kids its probably nice but adults running through or driving through for a quick bite you have to basically explain what you want on your burger Ordered 2 mcdoubles with cheese and 2 small fries and they were so dry they were kinda crunchy without cheese or even fully cooked Had to trim off parts that were either undercooked or too hard to eat And with burger being so dry its almost like you need a medium drink to even eat the burger and sadly I started with the fries And to top it all off after using a card in the drive through i never got a receipt Never going back Would rather go to checkers across the street
19531,2,There tea was nasty and there meal where cold

23189,2,Slowest most under staffed McDonalds I have ever been everyone honking on the drive trun people screaming they have been waiting forever very stressful environment
23190,2,"Manages to allow something to screw up anything Everytime I came here for 6 days in total Normally I do not eat at McDonalds but this place is very close to where Im staying

They have new electronic ordering system using touchpad on giant vertical screen Still gets my order wrong 80 percent of time What Asks me what drink I want Then I just get the cup so why ask me One day I leave the locator number on table while I go bathroom Locator and food is gone Takes me a while to get it sorted outforgets my drink again

One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure Gets little sauce on my clothes not too bad but Jesus Christ One night lot of drinks do not work except for coke yuk  few other things not worth mentioning They get swamped a lot nad hardly can keep up

Otherwise place is relatively new looking as well as private bathroom with your own stall and sink Clean"
15061,2,This location is very slow unfortunately
23192,2,Very disappointed that there was no indoor seating Doors were locked Drivethru only Needed to sit at a table and eat Decided to eat elsewhere

13502,2,Too many crazy homeless people and prices are more expensive than regular mcdonalds
24211,2,They messed my order up 2 times They remade my sandwich and the chicken was still raw They have nasty attitudes You have to use the kiosk to place your order There is no more service with a smile An update I now have food poisoning form the raw undercooked chicken I was served yesterday Dont eat here I will never come back here ever again My reviews have been see by over 100500 people
17804,2,Poor

25684,2,Slow service and the food was wrong not once but twice Complete waste of time and money
12133,2,Waited a hour and a half in line in drive through terrible service food cold and over cooked and slow incompetent help
21788,2,Prices are considerably inflated because it is on the strip 
23094,2,The facility is a contemporary fast food restaurant with self ordering stations making orders fast and reliable Notwithstanding the manager needs to work in interpersonal tact with her staff Ultimately the store next to McDonald gives customers a free gift if you bring your McDonalds receipt
14914,2,They got my hamburger order wrong after having repeated it 2x to them its just ketchup on a plain hamburger but they put onions n mustard on it
23077,2,the drivethru line is super long and aside from that the people who should be taking your order there dont even answer when you get to the ordering station It took us about 15 minutes to get a simple order and that was too long
19424,2,People have attitude issues  there not a good experience  today
19614,2,Slow but good
22997,2,This is the only McDonalds I know that decid

22869,2,Person was very rude gave me the wrong order and the food was cold check the food back and got my money back
10975,2,Only thing I liked was 24h running
19353,2,They never give you what you order and the food seems to be old and bad tasting
19351,2,There are better McDonald locations then here Usually 9 out of 10 times they forget something you ordered
14682,2,This place has fallen off all kiosks were down this morning No one manning the register One drive thru working
21131,2,This Mc Donalds was either short staff or very  unorganized It took a while to get our order staff looked like they were overwhelmed and people kept going back to fix their orders
24180,2,Customer service needs some serious work MOBILE APP was the first words out the the drive thru cashiers mouth not even a Welcome to McDonalds And the Egg McMuffin bread was hard Not a good experience
14678,2,"Are use my mobile app this morning I waited to hear your associates voice  he say go on with your order
When I order it he didnt asked me if I wante"
12048,2,The food was good Hot and fresh But every time I go the wait is inexcusably long
21975,2,Rude
14676,2,Quite possibly the busiest McDonalds in the area Every time I go here the drive thru line is backed up out to the street and the parking lot is full If you like your fast food not particularly fast this is your place
12821,2,Didnt have any more packs of peanuts for the sundaes Disappointing and this is at 7 pm
17981,2,Poor 
14703,2,Very slow service When I was waiting for my food two different customers came in with orders that were wrong I waited for over 10 minutes just for 1 McChicken sandwich 
12976,2,Clean but too expensive for fast food
22897,2,Food was hot and order came as it was ordered However they had no pop It was okay would i go back sure
12824,2,Waiting time is long
19363,2,"I just came and half of the
Crew was hanging out side the counter they talk too loud and speak in a very bad way  n words and Bi  words is a shame the place is pretty but a has a poor crew"
15282,2,Alright
12058,2,Extremely busy McDonalds it
21696,2,Slow service because of automated ordering systems
19359,2,The food and workers are great Its the people outside begging that really You know 
17980,2,Poor 
14697,2,The quality of the food has changed the product entirety
21692,2,Crazy amount of people and very slow location
17034,2,Poor 
22882,2,I GIVE IT 2 STARS because they were quickBut on the other handThe fries were coldand the burgers were drenched with ketchup Told the gentleman to hold one moment and 5 seconds later a girl came on Like give us a minute I normally dont write a review and I hate to leave a bad oneBut you would think because its in front of oldtown its hot and fresh Just got out of the hospital wanted a warm meal
10965,2,Really slow service Crazy long lines at 730 in the morning Expect paying customers to be out numbered by homeless
22877,2,Asked for a large water when they brought my order to my table  And she never came back
14690,2,"Every time I go there there are beggars who will ask you to buy them food to use your phone or to stick their hands and faces inside your car and ask for money  I get that panhandling is legal in Oak Park but that doesnt give someone the right to harass you when youre getting food
Please Oak Park government make panhandling illegal again most people who do this get in other peoples faces and harass them and verbally abuse them God forbid one of these people pulls a knife or gun on a customer if they say no
This location is always busy crowded with long wait times and half the time the food is cold"
23282,2,EVERY TIME THEY FORGET SOMETHING And i mean everytime I have heard conversations about general nonsense take priority over customers while waiting The employees generally juat dont seem to care with the exception of a few
12057,2,Couldnt eat there as they dont have Halal menu
24179,2,"Dine In is NOT available I went with family but we had to sit outside This is the case observed in the evening in majority of outlets Placed pickup order and manager stepped out and addressed orders one by one
Burgers are served with ONLY bread and patty and NO vegetables"
16740,2,Attendant didnt listen to what I ordered
12988,2,Waited in line for half an hour and it seemed like forever at the pickup window  I asked if they were short staffed and she said they were waiting on the fries But when I got them they were cold She offered no explanation until I got tired of waiting
25647,2,"This manager tru me out
Siad a was not welcome n his store just cus o told they need open at 5 am"
16731,2,Dirty  Tight parking lot  Too many homeless people
14647,2,not healthy place
21651,2,One cashier at all restaurants means to long of my time waiting
15354,2,Poor 
21650,2,I go to McDonalds cause its cheap and I use my McDs app a lot too
12038,2,"I stand almost 10 mns in front of a cashier Who completely ignore me When I requested to be served she looked at me and Says Im sorry I didnt see you
No surprise I am a black man 6 feets 2 and 260 lbs"
23298,2,It was terrible took forever Only giving 2 stars because the McMuffin was good
19323,2,I went in to use the bathroon before i go buy some thing and i saw i had to be  Buzz Inn so I went to the front to have me  to be buzzed in and I was told no I had to buy something first and the funny thing is Im a diabetic and my sugar was high and I was in pain but I had to buy something first just to be let into the bathroom then when I was let into the bathroom it was so disgusting Know one clean the bathroom the toilet was filled with toilet paper and piss all over the rim of the toilet dry on u can see it and the manager that Im assuming she had like a Jamaican accent and gave me kind of a nasty attitude also i wouldnt  recommend it  to come here and i was  visiting from upstate New York it was a long drive
25644,2,It was dirty there were flys and they got my order wrong When I asked to get my right items they acted like I Was wasting their time I switched to J n B now
20891,2,Poor 
17077,2,Poor 
23301,2,I didnt get much sugar for my coffee all milk and day getting served my Burger not my Burger my sausage mcmuffin didnt give it to me in the morning They got me for some money not a pleasant place to go when you hungry you want your food
20889,2,Poor 
24173,2,I ordered my food for pick up and when I walked into the restaurant it was cluttered with guests meandering about which I understood the behavior after MY 45 minute wait that was AFTER I waited 8 minutes to even be acknowledged by an employee So frustrating staffing seemed adequate just a lack of experience in prioritizing from the young manager
11002,2,Service is so so The bad some of the employees dont speak English And while I was here a confrontation between a black fat girl and an old bag on a wheelchair barking up a fight Heard the old lady call the black a gorilla
25109,2,the attention is good 
20887,2,Poor 
12814,2,Ordered a meal the only thing that was bad was a fries there were hard felt like I was chewing on rocks never get fries here especially at night time
14651,2,Typical McDonalds
16732,2,No tomatoes  Did not inform when ordering
19657,2,Messed up order
23286,2,They need better customer service The people in the drive thru are so rude that I almost came out my professional skin Get it together McDonalds 192 McDonalds close to go cart place
14673,2,The staff seem so concerned with meeting their target goals they arent paying any attention to the customers or the consistency or correctness of the orders Cashier wandered off to make a mocha but forgot to put the mocha in asked the manager if caramel went in a caramel macchiato The customers served ahead of me all had somethi
15320,2,Poor 
25651,2,better than mostbut the burger meat was cold fries was hot and good tho
22857,2,A clean place with a good airco food is another story Bread of the burgers is dried out french fries were cold No do not go here if you want good food
20896,2,Poor 
21667,2,The were super slow Dont recommend
13549,2,Very small place the coffee wasnt so good very crowded
21133,2,"The automated kiosks are horrible
This store is supposed to be fully automated but thats probably the reason why it just doesnt work   McDonalds should really look into the process and solve it The workers are at the mercy of inferior technology

I go into McDonalds and am instructed to use the kiosks

There are some that arent working some that are working  A customer instructs me not to use the one Im facing because its broken  Instead I use the one on the other side

The process of ordering on the kiosk is slow and cumbersome  I have a coupon which I wanted to use  I first add the item then scan the coupon VOILA double order  Okay my bad for not understanding the system  So now I have to remove the item I add another item and it takes me to the cart for some reason and says Is this all I want

So I add some more things and finalize my order  I try to check out but I have no way to edit my order to select to go  Okay no big deal Ill just choose a table and VOILA ERROR Please see a cashier

I talk to the McDonalds attendant and he tells me that he could find my order and that I can pay up front

During this time I see and here about 34 people sadly yelling at the McDonalds workers for messing up really its this automated system that doesnt work not the people

McNuggets were okay  They were warm but were on the verge of being dry
Fries were okay looked like they were out for awhile and they didnt fill it to the top
Soda this was good

I felt bad for the workers here since it seems the biggest issue is problems with the kiosks and how orders are sent over to workers"
24617,2,Not Brother bringing food food to tablelong wait and don
12042,2,Not very fast not very clean not very good The opposite of what could be a good fastfood restaurant On the plus side they have high chair for kids
16735,2,Convient probably would avoid if it wasnt right there
17766,2,Poor 
12991,2,"Frequently at this location someone is spewing toxic gases into the air violating local laws  humane rights despite a security guard on site
Cashiers are expected to be able to actually perform elementary subtraction such as 1275 because the US doesnt mint 3 dollar bills and I already have enough singles to stuff Magic Mikes gstring
If this location has take out hours  dining room hours that should be posted on entry ways  online Otherwise we patrons expect to sit down not be told the seating area is closed 30 minutes prior to closing and 20 minutes after opening MGMT should schedule site  employee hours accordingly"
15339,2,Poor 
21664,2,Nothing different from other McDs Slow from too many tourists
22838,2,No one to take your order its all done on kiosks had to have my ice coffee remade because they couldnt get it right the first time
23290,2,We really cant understand how hard it can be to complete our order Every single time we go they make multiple mistakes n its so frustrating
15343,2,Poor 
22466,2,Food was ok staff was not very curtious and no public restrooms  Would have been nice to be able to wash my hands before I picked up my burger
21697,2,Dining room was closed Very annoying
19372,2,Rude people as cashiers slow service annoying employees I reccomend you go to Burger King the employees are much nicer and the food is overall better
14707,2,This location is iffy at times because they have a high turnover rate and always training someone new Hard to really have any continuity when u have all new workers every other week
22959,2,"Our order was incorrect We ordered a Big Mac meal  with a large coke and a medium caramel frappe We were handed a medium coke with the meal and frappe When we said the coke was supposed to be large the worker Manager asked for the receipt which shows
1 Big Mac MlLrg
1 M Coke
Then she said You have to ask for a large We did She didnt offer to correct their error
When do you ever order a large meal with a medium drink The fry was a large but they were cold The Big Mac was dry I forgot why we dont usually go to McDonalds Thank you for reminding me"
14756,2,Its not what it used to be There longer waits in line and the service isnt really all that great Theyre sometimes understaffed because that people are overworked or not paid enough However it does serve the local community and passerbuys So it is good for something
22953,2,Fries were good and hot I also got the crispy chicken  sandwich It was hot but  seemed like they forgot to season it as it was very bland and basically had no taste at all The only thing I tasted was the two pickles on the sandwich I definitely will not get this sandwich again here I have to say overall ordering the crispy chicken sandwich at any McDonalds is a major gamble I have gotten it once or twice before when it was really good but more often than not it has not been good at all Bland burnt dry etc  take my advice dont get the c

Long time to cook"
22532,2,app doesnt work and theres always something wrong with my order every time i go there prices are no longer cheap either so now i go else where if possible
22947,2,Order was wrong despite using ordering terminal and salad had large section that was inedible see the picture Looked like the lettuce had been out of date for a month Took forever as well
22476,2,Washroom was filthy likely due to the number of Street people that frequent the place  Management not concerned Street people filling up on soda
19622,2,Always closing early
20949,2,Poor 
25668,2,Depends on the worker that you get can either be really nice or really rude What can you expect from McDonalds in oak cliff
22944,2,Horrible Got home ordered a crispy chicken sandwich They gave it to me on a plain dry bun with nothing on it Just chicken  bread
22474,2,Very long time waiting to make a order Very large queue
17006,2,I ordered a fish burger and it only brings the bread the fish and mayonnaise I expected it to bring lettuce and tomato but no I think it would be better with luchuga and tomato
15221,2,Ok
12843,2,You forgot to tell people their is very few 24 hour Mickey Dees And when u find one openvery limited on drinks
22968,2,We stopped in for a midday snack since we were across the street at Fun Spot of America  I placed a mobile order the cashier didnt know that after standing there for 5 minutes he finally said mobile order 1634 I raised my hand and he slide me the bag Never
16791,2,Limited parking and alot of traffic
12850,2,They take a long time to give the food
22996,2,Went at night at the request of my son since we had a very long day of driving Bad move on our part Ordered a filet It was totally hard Not just the bread The fish was a hockey puck Very nasty Had to throw it out The fries were the back upthank goodness for those at least  We also waited too long on line but his nuggets and fries were okay
19421,2,Food precooked and dried out like always Commercial lies Nothingcooked when u order
24556,2,Wrong order through the drive thru Doesnt surprise me any more with this location Glad Im not allergic to the items I requested to be removed
16808,2,Its good for an emergency
16989,2,They allow you to order on the mobile app for pickup until 11 when they physically close their doors at 10 so you have to wait at a little window Wouldnt have o
12952,2,The place was filthy  the ladies room was closed  and I  paid Starbucks prices at a crummy McDonalds
25676,2,By far one of the dirtiest McDonalds Ive ever been to 10 dirty tables the entire time we were there No hand sanitizer
24606,2,Super slow to get food  It appears drive thru got all the attention  15 minutes to get food is too long  Also when I order a breakfast meal with a soda I want the choice to get a larger drink when they are all the same price
19416,2,Food took forever to be prepared and they got the order wrong
25062,2,bad coffee in the morning
25675,2,Just a rude staff who seem to have a bad attitude  Order was correct and fine just rude people
19413,2,I bought two hamburgers it cost me 6
25673,2,I saw them hand mixing a shake and my Mcflurry wasnt even mixed Best thing here are the animal sculptures
14766,2,Dont like fixing orders becomes very rude even the manager  but does make thing I
14765,2,They never have fruit punch for kids and i can never get a carmel frappe im just going to start going to another one im disappointed everytime i come here
24607,2,I would rate it a 1 star but people would not take my review seriously I visited this restaurant last night It was very clean including the bathroom At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their order The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the register This wasnt possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk they had to get a receipt and pay at the register I left 20 minutes later and went to Wendys when the line had barely moved
22973,2,Says 24 hour drive through Theyre always closed shut down doing maintenance only cash systems are down or some other reasons why they cant serve the early risers They shouldnt post on the signa that the drive through is open just to not serve anyone or have it on maps that they are open just to refuse customers
16992,2,Too bad I only bought two coffees and it took me more than 19 minutes and they still moved me to the parking lot and then I had to return because they didnt take what I bought with them lousy service
13472,2,Bad customer service No beverage refill and no sauce place
21135,2,This Macdonalds fell short on a good quality customer service their staff was very rude to us and a few other customers on our day of visit they messed up on our order and we ended up eating 30 mins apart to my wife I was so disappointed Place was clean and you had to ask for a key to go into the restrooms we were in Vegas for vacations and we stayed at mndalay so this was the closest one to us the 3rd day we wanted Macdonalds again and we decided to drive 15 mins 
23265,2,Food cold and forgot items food was replaced so only 2 star Im afraid
20944,2,Poor 
12970,2,Only good thing is their coffee
22916,2,They forgot my ice cream but I went back and got it The line is very long weekends so go during the week The curbside pickup is excellent I am appending my review this is the second time I ordered and they forgot an item This McDonalds is beyond busy 
14721,2,This used to be the best location for the freshest food but it clearly is not anymore My nuggets were over done and I had to pour my drink out twice because it either tasted like pure syrup or water and I had to settle for something I didnt want to drink Also how do you ask the customer what kind of sauce they want and STILL dont put it in the bag and got the nerve to catch an attitude when I ask you for it I wont be going back to this location
24615,2,New system of ordering at kiosks is aweful Despite the most important thing to me being wanting to order with a human being ordering at the kiosk took longer and was more difficult than ordering with a humanand I wanted to pay cash which required I go to a cashier after ordering at the kiosk very frustrating Also the new fountain drink machines are equally aweful I will never order a drink from a machine that dispenses all drinks from one spout because no matter what you dispense it always tastes like a mix of more than one drink Why has McDonalds chosen to fix what wasnt broken and use systems and machines which customers so clearly dislike
20923,2,Poor 
15259,2,Nothing

10955,2,The the drive thru is consistently much linstantly much lower than whats expected
22909,2,I dont
24541,2,Dont know why but ever since the rebuild of this site the burgers are unbearable Never juicy dry and unfavorable as can be From the little burgers to the quarter pounder its the same Doesnt even taste like meat anymore They had the same problem with the nuggets at first but that got better after a few months but well over a year now and the burgers are just like eating flavored cardboard What happened
12825,2,The drive thru has a very slow service even when there is no line
19380,2,Waited very long to place an 3 mins ordered Terrible
25090,2,The manager attends you eagerly and does not want to give you cream for the coffee
17778,2,Poor 
22542,2,Food and service were fine but it has no restrooms really 50 of why I went in was to use the restroom
20942,2,Poor 
10938,2,The staff talk loudly they talk in their language The store trash was out of the container the whole hour I was there eating my food Theyre disrespectful to homeless people telling them to get the f out
17946,2,Poor 
24236,2,We went in to order and sat down to eat because we had eaten in other restaurants on idrive We were told that we could not eat there but way we were told was very rude
22940,2,"One of my favorite features of McDonalds for me is that I know what I can expect offerings flavors etc
This is true for this particular restaurant however it seems that being soooo busy I guess excellent location makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers

Running out of lettuce running out of many things are managementlogistics problems Bad attitude lack of courtesy well I guess that problem is on us the customers right

The two stars are for do providing the best breakfast sandwich in the market still regardless of attitude and bad manners"
22939,2,"Used a deal at the kiosk for a free kids meal w combo purchase and when I went to check out it said Deal is unavailable  wiped out the order forcing me to reenter everything and the deal code was now invalid I get that they are for participating locations but if youre not a participating location put up a sign or something so I dont waste my time
The drink fountain was closed to keep the restaurant clean according to the sign so I went to the counter and asked for a refill and the manager said We dont do refills here What Seriously Unlike every other McDonalds Youre gonna give me the saltiest fries ever and then make me pay for a refill Again if that is this locations policy fine But post a sign so that the expectation is set"
20931,2,Poor 
21930,2,Not so clean
13466,2,Terrible customer service Ruby was one of the rudest people I
14733,2,Went through the drive through and had poor customer service It was late at night 10pm though so I understand Also the wait was 15 minutes for my order while others were churning through Lesson learned chicken tenders take time
22929,2,Insanely busy line around the building for the drive through out the door for walk in and order ridiculously busy customer service was friendly but order was wrong and took a long time to complete maybe they just need more employees on a Sunday morning my family is

22473,2,One of the lower end McDonalds Ive been too Food was just ok
19384,2,"They are too slow even slower this time around
Horrible service"
22919,2,Every time I came during my two week visit I was asked to pull forward into the parking spots where the mobile ordering area is there was always 24  cars pulled up waiting for food just so they can make their drive thru times better No one wants to pull forward for you to make your ratings look better Get it together 
10937,2,The food was good bit the service was awful The cashier got an attitude because I asked if my order was right Then on top of that the person handing out an order did the same thing because I asked for ketchup
12720,2,Took too long and did not give me all of items
17268,2,I hate McDonalds ever since they got rid of the breakfast bagel sandwiches lol was the only decent food left that I liked But decent fries and sundaes Only went cause my daughter asked for something

11503,2,McDonalds is gross Shoddy craftsmanship
17512,2,Average Mcdonalds they forgot my ketchup  ah well
12472,2,Long service and restaurant not very clean
11507,2,Food was good but someone was doing drugs in the bathroom stall next to mepretty sketchy
13805,2,"We thought it would be cool to visit one of the largest McDonalds in the world  We regretted it  The chicken sandwich and pizza were all burnt a little too much  The ice machines werent working very well  The place was a mess and loud for 430 on a Sunday  The arcade had a few money grabbers where it took your money but no game But the skeeball had a machine that let you play for free
This place is just crazy and more expensive than my usual trip to McDonalds  I dont need to try their pizza which isnt bad but not great either  I would skip this or plan to come to try the pizza only as the price of pizza is fair"
22749,2,I ordered a hot latte and got lukewarmcold coffee
22353,2,Transient folks were arguing in the storecussing and offending all who were there  If u didnt have 90 centsthey would cuss at you  I know the ladies that worked there felt helpless  Need to have security protect paying customers
23895,2,They dork up the kids meal every time and the fries are never freshbut its a standard place
15798,2,Can barely taste the espresso in my frappe
12463,2,"After 2 hours at customs Nothing better than a cheeseburger that you will bitterly regret for the next 2 hours on the road
He is in a terrible state"
16335,2,Lines are SOOO long and extremely slow everytime I come here I dont know why the staff is so i
14039,2,I was on my way to work in the morning I waited almost 10 minutes just for service The young petite lady with some what redshort straight hair and wearing a hat was rude impatient and basically I was bothering her But as I got to the window another sweet and friendly girl took my payment But as I got my food from the first rude girl she had this look on her face like leave already I am a morning person Im always nice to everyone even when Im treated disrespectful
21207,2,Ok 
15688,2,They dont give you enough time to order they put to much salt on the fried they are not friendly at all my grandson loves McDonald I go there for him the one on 35 really is awful you have to be told to pull up for decaffeinated coffee come on they give you the wrongorders just to get rid of you
12470,2,My child wanted to eat McDonalds so I drove over and bought it for him The worst impression was that while waiting there I saw a few flies flying around in the kitchen
15801,2,Shake machine ALWAYS DOWN after Lunch Rush NEVER dinner time EXCUSE AFTER EXCUSE
12481,2,Not very clean but true to McDonalds
21342,2,Could be because the place was under construction but the service was ridiculously slow we spent at least 5 minutes at the second window The lady tried to keep two of our drinks and there was no napkins in the bag
20411,2,I am very irritated right now The woman who took my order messed it up then shorted me on my order and I went back through to the rest of my order she proceeded to try and charge me again When I tried to call or talk to management I got fax noises This is ridiculous will not be coming back this McDonalds
25491,2,Their ubereats need to be more attention to detail n packed nice not just thrown in always missing something i asked for bought the big breakfast meal and got sent no silverware no syrup nothing like Damn how am i going to eat this i even put a note in the app to add napkins and condiment n still cant receive it whats the point of leaving a note if no one reads it Ive order different times and never fail to disappoint me
23899,2,I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and it was tough and undercooked I do not recommend
13802,2,"We went here on June 6 2023 We tried a little bit of everything
Ordered a Philly cheesesteak pepperoni pizza kids meal big Mac meal and 2 mcdoubles

The wait was absolutely ridiculous and when they brought us the food it was ice cold We didnt complain because the lines were super long and nobody was around to help The one guy picked up my daughters kids meal thought it was trash and I told him and he said he was sorry and walked off
The arcade was just a mad house So busy and very dirty so was the restrooms We dont be going back thats for sure"
24365,2,Line for drivethru was slow and when we got up to order literally a third of the menu said that it was not in stock Be back soon We ended up not ordering
15805,2,Young people do not care very much about customer service
23667,2,Slow af I don
20414,2,This McDonalds is less than subpar Theyve gotten most of my meals wrong have charged me extra on items before and a few times have just given me the wrong order I just stopped going here eventually and started going to another franchise down the 35
16352,2,High volume drive thru with heavy wait time This McDonalds cant handle amount of people that here If you want to wait a long time for the meal Then you came to the right palce

14060,2,Still waiting for a good McDonald
24359,2,Was so excited for my first time coming to the big McDonalds  because I was told you could order special menu items First disappointment Second not only were there no numbers to grab once you ordered your food but we waited over an hour for a ham and cheese French toast that we watched sit in the window under a heater that wasnt even working for over 20 mins a McDouble and Big Mac and a frozen coffee that was half melted Very disappointing Will NEVER go back The employees were all chi
18272,2,Urger buns taxted stale Fries were little more than broken potato sticks Absolutely terrible location
25487,2,Burgers are always flat Good for on the road food I sure do miss the dollar menus tho And they charge for mayo if you add it but not if you get packets humm
12486,2,Very bad and sweet mc muffin green bad
11763,2,Horrible service
13368,2,No refills on soda pop They also saved money by not giving me my breakfast sausage Two stars though for having the lights on
22280,2,Was very busy Skip the line by ordering online through the app Make sure take your order togo because the lobby is nasty
21344,2,Bathrooms are locked in a way that only a manager can open them  Then theres no hand soap or toilet paper  Took FOREVER to get us our food  Just subsatandardeven by McDonalds standards
21325,2,Very long wait for food coffee not made the usual way Cashier did his best to be courteous but without correct leadership that is best we will get
11476,2,The slowest mcdonalds Ive ever encountered and the worst part was they got my order incorrect after having to wait that whole time
23686,2,Good morning good morning the coffee was old the place is dirty I will not come back here again the people are nice but the place is dirty very dirty please clean up paint please cleanest McDonald though the bathroom was dirty the tables were dirty the outside was dirty have a great day
20450,2,Third time in two weeks I wait through a long line only to find out that they are taking cash only  Nobody can stand back at the entrance to the drive through to keep you from getting trapped in it  This management team sucks
11540,2,The staff is very rude and they need more security there
24770,2,Sloooooow service 100 PM and just got a cheeseburger  small fries from drivethru because I was late for a meeting Took 15 minutes for this simple order Reallyfor a burger  fries
18285,2,Girl taking orders in the drive through didnt listen very well Asked for 2 hashbrowns it was never added to my order I said it 3 times
11544,2,Curbside took for ever I had to get down and claim my food
25334,2,SLOW SLOW SLOW and the younger people there are so RUDE New renovation but same slow workers and RUDENESS this past Saturday waited 15 min in drive thru and never placed an order we as many as 10 cars backed out and left
16328,2,My experience was ok They forgot little things in my order like a straw for iced tea and cream and sugar that i requested  The wifi is not available like they stated when searching for wifi there is no mcdonals wifi instead it was a wired name like EBOS The connection did not allow for simple web browsing  For a Mcdonalds thats near universal studios This place is ok
20466,2,There burgers has gotten worse than ever but their fries are still good
23701,2,Ive had good and bad experiences here Havent had ti
20461,2,Decent food for mcdonalds but 510 minutes to get your food unlike most mcdonalds
11751,2,its mcdonaldsneed I say more
14011,2,Hostess at the entrance had no desire to be there and wasnt shy about showing it same went for the cashier If youre used to Canadian prices expect to pay almost double that Crispy chicken had pickles on it and thats it no sauce or anything it also tasted like fish Do not recommend Beyond disappointing for being an attraction
23702,2,Ordered 2 fillet o fish sandwiches after not having McDonalds for  months ordered Xtra cheese got extra tarter instead Had it remade got no tarter no extra cheese again This is why ppl  are mad you make such a high wage 
23881,2,Lost my order while the place was almost empty Chicken tenders were overcooked
23703,2,The food was at McDonalds standards But the upkeep of the restaurant was less than average Garbage cans overflowing Foot prints all over the floor and the fountain drink dispenser wasnt draining Its had about an inch of fluid in the waste catcher You couldnt even set your cups down to fill them up
23705,2,"Pretty much the definition of meh and ok service Had the unpleasant pleasure of having an older lady by the name of Precious take my order and was just awful She had the worst I dont care kind of attitude Worst yet  I believe she was the shift last or manager

Either way  if you dont care for the customer service the food is usually on par"
14007,2,Absolutely horrible McDonalds the staff were rude and over worked They didnt help you in any way at all I waited 30 minutes for a coffee and when I went to ask for the cup to pour my own I got snapped at
25452,2,Same ol ready in 2 minutes food Idk how they do it  But ramen needs to step up their game because it takes longer to cook noodles in the microwave  Great Job Mickey Ds
23706,2,"Its 615pm line is SUPER LONG Waited a quite of bit of time just to order So be prepared
Food was hot and fresh  10 piece nugget meal"
21308,2,One car in front of me  they order big mac meal 17 mins to get it Worst customer service ever
11537,2,They forgot to add sauces and ran out of napkins  What restaurant runs out if napkins
11535,2,People are usually drunk here and the service people really dont like their jobs
14015,2,Be ready for a 45 min to 15 hr wait for food  For McDonalds food The line for cancelli ng orders was surprisingly long
24764,2,Beautiful establishment both inside and out but the soda dispensers werent working and waiting in line to get drinks and ketchup sucks when other customers are placing orders and facing the same dilemma
12454,2,Too noisy unfriendly staff
13817,2,"We were given the wrong meal the same meal more than 4 times while employees argued that it wasnt our food and weve been sitting here with our table number and corresponding receipt stating what we ordered for almost an hour still with no food The outside looks amazing but inside is complete chaos the coordination and way of operating a busy business to get people their correct orders in this type of area with high population needs improvement

Update After 45 mins we got our food Luke warm fries and the Sandwiches weren"
23690,2,"Ive been going to this location most of my life since its not far from my home So Ive seen this McDonalds go through a lot of changes The employees here generally have decent attitudes there are a few that tend to be rude The store is also dirty a lot of the time Its a very busy location and maybe its from having a lot of foot traffic but the floor is usually dirty the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky the ketchup area will be out of ketchup andor there will be ketchup all over the place too The tables tend to be dirty too you usually have to clean off your own table Also they have those light up tables that kids like and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there and they wont be eating and theyll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours And mind you these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights and Ill have to tell him he cant because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table is camping there The employees dont seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours but buying anything Sometimes theyll even be sleeping at the table
The kids play area is also really crappy They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly or at all When I was a kid they had a huge playplace which they took out when they remodeled the store It even had N64s at one point along with the playplace But they took it all out and replaced it with a sitting place instead of a playplace Its really awful
So all in all this McDonalds is dirty has a lot of homeless people that practically live there and isnt really kid friendly The food is okay as long as its hot food I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong and the employees are generally friendly but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster meaning that you can tell they dont want to be there This location needs a lot of work And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there There hasnt been a single time Ive gone there that there wasnt at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself The table is by the front counter too and you can often times smell the homeless person thats sitting there the whole time youre waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks It is not kid friendly at all at this store With the store being in a nicer part of town youd expect quite a bit more cleanliness"
11521,2,Not because of the staff or food Because its understaffed Too long a wait in lobby and drive thru
15691,2,Food was not fresh and the prices have gone up
24767,2,The nuggets from this location were the WORST Ive ever had Unfortunately I didnt taste them until Id gotten back to my room otherwise Id definitely have asked for my money back
14027,2,Come on people this place is so dirty and gross Didnt try the pizza or pasta but felt like I waS touching every virus known to man My Big Mac was cold and no sauce I was standing there when it was put up
11525,2,They always get the order wrong in some way always
25467,2,The service could be better they always forget to give you condiments and napkins Even after youve ask Then soon as you drive away  You have to come back and go inside and explain that you were lied to
17525,2,They messed my order up
25466,2,Well it might have been ok if I was not rushing but I still stayed for my items For this to be McDonalds they should know that its busier during certain hours then othersthere were soo many ppl in line the average person would have turn right back around n walked out
13286,2,The problem is with these Mexican cashiersWhen they have s Mexican customer they all know each otherSo after they orderThey chit chatEven when it busyplus they get better customer thsn the Whites doAnd that to me is discrmmation
12448,2,McDonalds is McDonalds
18499,2,Food always wrong and over cooked
23696,2,Get a veggie burger already God
13819,2,I really wanted to looooove this Mc Donalds store since they are the biggest in the world But being this famous comes with a price overcrowded and short staff People were mad in the line asking for the food saying they ordered their meal 30 minutes ago Hello30 minutes This is insane Very tourist location I just wish the manager would hire more people to work there so they can attend that much of people
12443,2,Unorganized
21316,2,Prices are too high just because theyre on the Strip you dont have to double your prices personally I think its ridiculous why rip everyone off  just cuz youre on the Strip  yeah I know rent is more expensive  But you get so much more traffic so many more customers It goes handinhand
21324,2,There was not a long wait in the drive thru but the food was cold and stale   Fries un salted and cold fish sandwich was dry and sad   Will not be going back
20469,2,Spent 20 minutes inline at the drive through and the iced coffee was still very bland and unlike its normal taste
13263,2,Its McDs in Santa Monica But this is where people without means to afford other food around here come Its a wild ride any time of the day Ordering is always chaos
13800,2,Largest McDonalds in the US they are trying to doing so much and doing none of it well Four  orders and three had missing items No salt on the room temperature 
22758,2,Food price is the most expensive Mcdonalds i ever been
21367,2,Mehjust meh Back in the day McDonalds was a treat you looked forward to now the foods more expensive the fries are never fresh and the buns are usually stale Theyve dropped the ball
24713,2,Wait for my order over 10 minutes drive thru2 Deluxe with extra onions Fries where soggy Had to go back inside to get fresh fries Looked under staffed
18249,2,"This McDonalds sucks They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drivethru but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds The management

The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drivethru timer because you will always have to pull up at this McDs Always Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times 1 burger  fry at 3pm  pull up next to the 34 other cars already there

The one manager Ive had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order that I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes for no less and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash The best part He made me pull up to get the cash

So again Mismanaged terrible McDonalds Its a franchise for a reason this one just stinks"
13251,2,The management and staff argues with the customers and its like a prison and highly prejudiced in quality of service towards fellow brown folks  Its disgusting
16370,2,"Used the app to order but took 30 minutes to get it to me at the counter Thats way too long Tons of people got served before I did and my order was placed well before the other customers showed up The only thing going for this place is that its 24Hours drive through And dont use the app relaying orders to individual stores may have some bugs

081521
Update this place is torn down The building razed and the lot surrounded by fencing I guess the bums from the nearby overpass finally took its toll Too bad cuz the 24 hour drive thru was pretty convenient"
11421,2,Food is has not been hot only luke warm Follow me on IG 77 Points Review
14116,2,Do yall close the dining room at 10pm or 952pm
18248,2,"They watered their parking lot with a poorlyengineered irrigation syztem right before days of hard freezelet everyone skate through the ice for a day before closing during the majority of the freeze when everyone needed a hot meal
Whataburger stayed open and served a limited menu to support Roanoke"
20380,2,Started at drive thru and started ordering food at first able to hear the lady but after I order my first thing I could not really hear her and then when I got my food it was wrong
18251,2,They seemed overwhelmed at lunch in Drive thru Very slow Then when at window was asked to pull forward when simply ordering a number 2 with nothing special added Seriously a quarter pounder takes extra time to make Now I remember why I dislike McDonalds
23910,2,Dirty slow inefficient They now bring your food to your table They forgot me So my food was colder than usual
25512,2,The customer service is just not what it used to be There is no Welcome to McDonalds just how can i help I ended up payimg for someone elses order At 1st i thought it was more but it was 20 cents less Im glad i only go there for drinks
14113,2,Consistently inconsistent 117 pre ordered thru the app  No one in line in the drive thru took 20 mins to get my order  While I watched car after car after car go thru the line  I finally called in and and asked the status  AFTER 20 Mins was advised the manager was getting it now  Wait what  It was beyond COLD  50 of McDonalds down the drain  And I ha
20385,2,Didnt get my order correct No inside seating I wish I could have tried their sausage gravy and biscuits but I am not taking that to go
22370,2,Slow I only come here for Diet Coke and they take forever Wish that they would speed it up for drink only orders Always people loitering inside and homeless loitering outside
25306,2,Poor 
23648,2,Unfortunately today while waiting in line pulled to the side not in the drive through lane my frappe was given to the person behind me She graciously didnt take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with it I waited 10 mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink back I was very confused by this especially in Covid times I requested a different drink no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be safe The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait again Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this 
12525,2,Food ios great but the drive thru linesn are insane
23642,2,food is typically put together well however curbside is a minimum of 20 minutes once you pull up Then hopefully you can get a curbside spot because the spots are usually full of customers theyve had pull forward and park to wait for their food might as well go through the drive thru
16199,2,Poor 
12535,2,I just wanted iced tea and a mocha frappe They were just what I needed The service was seriously lacking how ever the drive thru person was rude and seemed to not be able to understand my simple order although we were both speaking English and it seemed to be the only language that they spoke
11393,2,It was in the middle of being renovated but the and food was worse than usual I would recommend staying away until renovations are done and then give them a chance
13380,2,Hotspot for the homeless Some people were very rude and bothering little kids This seems routine and manager didnt do anything to remove these people
15636,2,Frys where discusting brown and hard and awful tasting the hot and spices I got where good but the frys where horrible the line was long as well in the drive threw I woudnt recommend this place
11796,2,Bit costly
16376,2,Im not sure whats wrong with this location but half the time I go there the food I get is old and cold Today I went through the drivethru and they had a rush there were about 10 cars ahead of me So Im not sure how they can serve me cold food when theyre constantly feeling orders Just extremely disappointed with this location I ordered a big Mac combo and the big Mac was cold and the fries were even colder
22258,2,Fries had a soft old feel nuggets not crispy chicken burger was brownish and stale this was 2am but others on this island at this time are way more fresher So nahhhh
21374,2,This McDs location has NO sit down dinning available I requested extra pickles and still got only 1 pickle per cheese burger Lame
23639,2,Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this McD I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate service I am not sure if its because my car is quiet or what but its mildly annoying Never has my sauce order been correct Never Even when I pay for it Even when I ask and confirm at the window Its awkward confirming sauce and then having to ask for the exact sauce you were just promised was in the bag
13775,2,Food was standard McDonalds  They forgot our drinks for each person at the table and forgot 12 our meal  We had to go back multiple times to get stuff They were out of the drink flavors once we got our cups It
20366,2,"Dont think we got a reciept
We like to come to this place after work because we got off around 12 This hasnt just happened to say but we ordered 2 Mcdoubles a breakfast sandwich and a mcchicken Instead of the Mcdoubles we got 2 mcgriddles At this point with how many time my order has been wrong I should just have to stop to the side and check cuz I dont think we got a receipt"
25523,2,Today June 22 2017 at 2105 aka 825 my order was taking in drive thru I ask for Double chesse burger with no oins and no pickles with large sweet tea extra ice add lemon So my drink had no extra ice or lemon and frys I drive home to eat my food which I stay 22 mints away from store it by my school I get hone to open my bag to have only receive Hot  Spicey and no Frys which was not my order and young lady at both windows ready my order back I have called the store 8 times to speak with manager and nobody has pick up the phone
11404,2,My experience of is this specific McDonalds according to Customer Service and Cleanliness of the restaurant tends to be on the lower tier of fast food restaurants around San Diego
23915,2,Pictures are misleading No way does that chicken sandwich is so big liar liar pants on fire
22760,2,Its McDonalds at least you get like an hour of free WiFi
15643,2,They mess up my order alot and employees act like its my fault That and after midnight they dont want to take your credit card Always claiming the system is down
23641,2,Ok so I went and tried the new Spicy chicken nuggets I personally prefer the Wendys spicy nuggets they are much more tender and fresh tasting The McDonalds Spicy Nuggets were Spicy alone add on the Spicy sauce and they will make you sweat But mine were extremely dry and hard one had a weird rubber chewy piece so that was interesting I can say I tried them but I was not impressed
17455,2,typically get your order wrong Check your purchase before you drive away
16373,2,Employee at the first window was very helpful and he made sure my order was right however the girl at the second one ignored me and looked confused The muffin sandwich bread was stale and very tough and the hash browns were cold and also tasted like they sat on a shelf for way too long After 2 bites I threw it in the trash and purchased a sandwich from a near by gas station much better food Im from out of town and on my way to a meeting so returning wasnt an option
20369,2,Asked for no pickles and I got a warm chs burger with pickles yuck Nuggets were warm they forgot my sauce My drink was all wrong I think they are better at breakfast time Geeze
25509,2,My family and I get to this McDonalds we are shocked it looked so nice from the outside and they have the jungle themed play house I ask if they have an outlet so that I may charge my laptop and phone and no The WiFi here is not even strong enough I could not complete my homework  Bummed out  Not the best as usual
14072,2,McDonalds is good comfort food when you need a bite Still wish they could improve on customer service and adding ketchup to the fries Disappointing only because its a multi billion dollar corporation that cant get the simple things right
16363,2,The parking lot is one of the worst All the spots are way too narrow and cramped
15655,2,The drive through cashier dumb as the dickens My order was wrong 3x so u be the judge Good luck
11461,2,Slowest fast food I ever purchased and the order was wrongI timed it was in line for over 17 minutes
11462,2,Orders took forever uber eats pick up cant stand the bew rude staff
12270,2,Ive never been to a slower McDonalds
20637,2,Do not recommend
18555,2,Slow service and rude
12506,2,My burgers were made sloppy and the service was slow
18552,2,If your in hurry i guess
23656,2,The employees are great but the store manager is just a nightmare We have coupons with the McDonalds app The store manager stated that she really hoped that they would stop honoring them because she was tired of having to ring then up My wife and I went to the restaurant today and she said the system was down and she would not accept them at all Im going to try and avoid this McDonalds in the near future
15662,2,They made us wait longer than expekted but the food was good
22362,2,Limited menu expensive beach location without a public bathroom  They make a huge deal about fresh pineapple with value meals but forgot to give it to us  Very young and disorganized staff Not what I expected from a mcdonalds
14081,2,"Cannot comprehend why McDonalds has employees posted in the drive thru lanes taking orders well out of view of the menus This just frustrates and delays customers for no reason

If you are trying to be like ChickfilA youre facilities were not built to serve that operating model nor are your employees trained to work that way efficiently

McDonalds used to be a place to dash into for a fast meal but its faster to go and dine inside most any other restaurant at this point

Food was up to standard and only reason I gave  "
20630,2,I just  passed  by
17484,2,Long wait at the drive thru and cold food
12501,2,Been coming to this Mc Donalds every time Im in the area never had a bad experience till today I ordered a double quarter pounder with cheese meal by far the Greasiest Burger Ive ever had in my life nasty
15665,2,Ehh kind of slow and food usually doesnt taste that great
24726,2,Only two power outlets in the whole place and the best one is at the employees table Noisy and confused environment Not for business people Has a 60 minute time limit on  Internet
12273,2,Slow service and mediocre food
24730,2,Quite literally one of the worst McDonalds ever Staff is incompetent unfriendly and doesnt get the order right or the food is OLD As the manager of a 1500 room resort I advise all of my guests to detour this location
14083,2,This is the slowest McDonalds Ive ever experienced  The staff is difficult to deal with and 5 out of 5 times our order is wrong Great location and clean facilities though
15811,2,They do not accept coupons from the McDonalds app
17480,2,ORDERED 3 items only got 2
20397,2,The food was okay but the service was horrible I was even told to have a good night or anything like that They need better customer service
21361,2,Mcds is expensive for the type of food and how they treat the employees I ordered sausage McMuffin hash brown LG c9ffee 700 my total is 119 145 160 plus 825 tax under 500 Im sorry but mcds make billions per day and steals even more Going 2 manager Seriously people needs 2 be more aware what companies are doing You say its only 200 but it happens all the time And the companies is the only one who benefits Just saying Sad
22368,2,This is by far the cheapest place to eat at Waikiki beach Unfortunately that also makes it a very attractive spot for all the drug addicts and homeless of the city While I generally dont mind homeless people eating next to a meth addict on a bad trip is not the most pleasant experience Not one star since you can get sick full for 5
23908,2,As has been for the last year slow slow service Went inside this time no better
14103,2,Normally I would rate this with a 5 star but lately this location has been having a lot of staff coordination I just left today and I asked for pancakes with sausages and added bacon to it but they forgot to add the sausage which by the way normally comes with the order So I get to work to the surprise that I paid extra for something missing in my order The place and the foods fine but the coordination with the employees and the supervisors needs to improve a lot
18570,2,Not a fan
13253,2,The employee at the register was so unprofessional didnt greet didnt say thanks   like if it was free went to get a refill turns out  they dont give any Restroom was cleanthats about it
14100,2,The ice machine was out of ice had to wait several minutes for my breakfast due to all the online orders waiting in front of me service was really slow They obviously have a labor issue at this McDonalds not enough people working at this location
18568,2,Lines too long
24720,2,The service was awful and rude They messed up my order when trying to get it fixed the manager had and attitude even though I had my receipt to show I wasnt lieing
14096,2,Very poor service While on a long road trip we stopped in to get gas and coffee Upon entering the McDonalds the floors were extremely dirty but we came after lunch so maybe they had a busy lunch rush Then when I stepped up to the counter to order the menu screens were stuck on frozen 2 advertisements Then I order 2 Caramel Mocha  Coffees After about 3min of waiting the kid behind the counter tells me the machine broke he needs to get the manager Come to find out the machine is on autoclean and it will be 18min before our coffee is ready Not wanting to wait around they tell me they can give me two regular coffees When I tell them that regular coffee is 1 a cup and I was charged 758 for two specialty coffees they offer to make up the difference in food Thats nice and all but we did not want nor need any food I ask for just a refund at that point Mind you this whole ordeal takes almost the 18min for the machine to finish cleaning but by now I just wanted to get out of there The staff were all very young and seemed very poorly trained While they were nice and tried to make it right I think better training of the employees at this location is necessary While waiting for my refund I watched multiple other customers receive the wrong order or had issues with their food I dont often go to McDonalds but continued visits with poor service has definitely left a bad impression
14095,2,It was ok but they didnt bag my happy meals and my nuggets and and no drink holder 3 drinks and a shke so it all feel out in the car and the shake stained my seats but it happens right
22692,2,No bathrooms and no smiles   lucky my kids like the food
21201,2,Slowest mcdonalds Ive ever been to  Been 30 minutes and food still hasnt come
20392,2,"I had to spend the weekend here Hate that as I might McDeath was doing fine with my ice coffees which I admit I am addicted Until Monday morningsighwhen I got that 1 McDeath manager who thinks they are in charge of making sure this multibillion dollar Corp gets its 50 whether they are asking for it or not
McDeath has a great app"
24375,2,They certainly need to take a look at the way they are staffing the night shift This location seems to be very popular at night and yet the management has barely anyone back there making orders There was a giant mob waiting at the registers for their orders Be smarter with your manning
14091,2,"I have to do this cause Im upset with McDonalds as a former employee but also a business partner if you can call Doordash a business partner

They dont pay enough so the employee turnover rate is high or they just dont show up they have seemingly no limits on how many delivery and mobile orders people can place so they get backlogged swamped and cant keep up

I parked called told them I had an order and they said to get in the drive thru By the time I got to the window they hadnt even started the order It took 20 minutes in total I lost money waiting on McDonalds

Seriously reformat your business structure It was embarrassing working here and apologizing for the ineptitude of this company

Be nice to the employees its not their fault Im not even sure its the managers fault but they have to tell their higher ups about this"
21202,2,It was stressful watching everyone and everything The lady ordering a frappuccino and getting mad that they dont have frappuccinos seemed like a person I would never want to be friends with Felt sorry for the guy working the register for having to deal with that angry demanding bag But the food was good
22755,2,Long lines but pretty fast service
11458,2,under staff Took way too long to get our meals
11433,2,Lots of homeless people in the restaurant  Made it uncomfortable  The employees were awesome though and great service
14140,2,Drive thru not hardly You might as well go in and wait Placed our order at 107 finally came at 120 There were 3 cars ahead of us still waiting for their orders When you are in a hurry pass this one by At least they are consistent with their slowness The food wasnt even hot Tired of giving them chances
20472,2,What ever happened to fast service and hot food you get neither at this place
23708,2,Everything Very good but I ask for fresh fries and the spanish manager there wanted me to stay with warm fries and I said nofresh fries are fried in the momentthey should be taught to say give us a minute your fries will be fried at the moment because the customer is very important for usand period
17599,2,Fries were too salty
23783,2,The food is ok The price is ok If you go through the drive through they always make you pull forward because your food isnt ready yet
18326,2,Rude on the drive thru speaker and at the window the only postive was the person who  gave me my food She was very kind and polite to me
17603,2,Its McDonalds What do you expect
24868,2,No vegeterian options
15748,2,Drive Through Did not give me ketchup for my fries
24325,2,Too crowded inside and in the drivethru Did not get a chance to eat there Looks nice though
16253,2,Poor 
24865,2,All self ordering machines food took forever to come out drink machine didnt work
23812,2,Very slow Drive thru line was wrapped around the building so I went in to order Took 15 minutes to get a cheeseburger and fries
16254,2,Poor 
17650,2,Unity
21222,2,Very slow and poorly run store Has potential to be a great location with great profits But the management is horrid and help is not helpful and pretty much hasnt clue on what is going on Ordering takes for ever and food even longer
24874,2,Horrible service You could tell the food had been sitting  I asked for more and it was the same The milkshake machine is never working or they say they are cleaning it They clean it at the wrong times I DO NOT recommend this McDonalds
17608,2,The Bathroom was very dirty
23855,2,Nice employees but waited 15 min for cold food
20543,2,Fries were cold and wasnt cooked all the way
22314,2,One of the worst McDo I have visited Brown lettuce wet chicken Bad service At least the place is clean
18328,2,Sat in the drive thru for about 15 to 20 min because they were very busy and still got very cold food Took the fries back Very disappointed
23861,2,McDs needs to stop messing with the 1 sodas
21257,2,Exactly what youd expect from a McDonalds minus the speed which is disappointing for fast food We went during what seemed to be rush hour but there was only a skeleton crew on and a single server We waited for 40 minutes for our food and some of it came cold i dont even know how that happens Definitely not impressed by the service
23769,2,Bummed The girl behind the counter was so helpful Pretty upsetting that ALL of the sandwiches in my order were wrong Yaymy fries were right
12358,2,Service was awful
13852,2,"Slowest service on planet Atleast 50 cars left in last 30 mins while I am waiting on drive thru
If you can staffed appropriately and efficient folks can make thousands extra without doing anything extra Just process order with some speed and sense of urgency Very slow service I wonder if top management is aware of how slow is the food service in general at McDs Its been 50 mins in drive thru still no luck
There are only a few unique items on the menu and this i"
13318,2,Food ok not good with kids dirty and lot of weird and homeles people Better avoid and try subway next door
21219,2,Only eat here if youre desperate for some cheap fast food
18411,2,Indoor playground smells of mold The ceiling and ventilation have black mold
24853,2,Service was very slow Managers did not work with urgency to get orders out on time while people waited 20 minutes for their orders
18318,2,"There worse  Wet lettuce  or dead
Fries or nasty burnt dried up 500 Sunday Sept 25  Made attempt  to call management  but kept  hanging  up there phone This restaurant  needs to shut down"
20593,2,Gross food and nasty dinning area
23766,2,"This McDonalds chicken sandwich tasted like they changed the cooking oil once a year nasty
Plus they always forget something by th"
20592,2,Slow drive thru service
18322,2,How do you miss a patty on a big mac  First time going there too
12348,2,Lousy service cold food
12303,2,I like very yummy
13951,2,Not a nice experience at all  Kids were so excited about visiting this branch as its apparently been on You tube but omg Service is Very poor  Staff seem to have been given a sentence of working in here  The food quality is questionable as well  Would not recomend at all
18404,2,They got our order wrong like three times I revisited Never again
12346,2,So dirty
15737,2,Ordered bacon big mac got a burger with no bacon service was fast thoughprobably explains lack of bacon
24858,2,Was under staffed long wait order was gotten wrong
20531,2,2 people ahead with orders and 30 minutes of waiting for cold fries
11678,2,Not the best one it is just fine
25394,2,"They where not friendly The girl at the drive through was on her phone and didnt give us change or receipt Got to the 2nd window was handed our drinks and asked to pull in a spot Waited at least 15 mins before anyone came out to our car Asked what we orderedand for our receipt which we didnt have
Finally brought our food out and 2 burgers where wrong"
11679,2,Forgot the bacon on my mcdouble
18384,2,They gave us wrong order  had to wait 15 mins r longer to get are right order
13877,2,Too crowded wait hours in line for food just go to a regular McDonalds not worth the wait either Waste of time in line Arcade  is also small and not worth it go to a bigger and better one
23842,2,Very very slow in the mornings and employees are not too friendly
18370,2,How can this place change staff so often and guaranteed to get tour order wrong
24879,2,Unwilling to keep someone at the register I had to yell after standing alone over 2 minutes to get their attention
22321,2,Your Covid rules are ridiculous In your effort to keep everyone safe you bunch everyone up either ordering or waiting for their food Your restaurant is plenty big to separate people out use it
23845,2,They seemed like they gave me old food and the fries was to hard and the buns as well
11712,2,Crews are not friendly
21233,2,Quick service Burgers were barely hot A lot of aggressive homeless people in the area A woman approached my son and I while we were dining inside and asked Would you mind sharing some chicken Nope Never Again
24885,2,Still a good place to go to but it seems that the management rather serve drivethru than inside service Having to wait for the drivethru to finish  before waiting on inside customers makes you want to go somewhere else 
12318,2,Very slow in the evening hours
24882,2,Customer service sucks When I get to the 2nd window no talking they just hang my drink out the window and then shove my food out I ordered a bacon quarter pounder plain and I get  a mc double with extra mac sauce 2 times in a row my order was messed up not returning
11702,2,Horrible customer service
21231,2,"Not only am I not a big fan of fast food joints but Im absolutely opposed to filth in any restaurant
And filth is what I experienced at this McDonalds
The staff who waited on us was nice accommodating and quick and the food adequate but the restaurant itself had empty sugar and creamer packs laying everywhere Reason being there as no place to throw them away
So I am advising you to avoid this McDonalds"
16263,2,Poor 
18348,2,Only had 8 nuggets in my box and the fries were way past shelf life
20570,2,Pancakes were cold and hard And computers were down
23851,2,Fries were cold and seemed like they were dropped back in the grease after already being cooked so were the nuggets
20564,2,I need to make it better quality service
21232,2,They forgot my apple slices but still charged me we literally only ordered 8 hashbrowns 3 soft drinks and my apples it was not a hard order at all And I didnt notice till we got back to our hotel because you know you cant eat indoors or even outside
21237,2,I got a value meal hamburgers were very dryno condiments on the bun fries were not cooked all the way still frozen The CocaCola was flat I dont expect gourmet just a little bit better quality
11696,2,Really Slow service
13333,2,Not to much of a fan of the menu but some of the ice coffee drinks are good This location is always busy and full not the cleanest ether
22316,2,Slowest fast food joint in the world Took 45 minutes to get an egg McMuffin on a Wednesday at 9am
24887,2,Checkout took forever  Only 1 cashier Didnt  receive my drink cup had to ask for it as well as the size also staffer didnt  give us the milkshake ordered No sense of Urgency They need to be more like Chick Filet I heard several ordered after mine werent  right Disappointed
18382,2,11 minutes between order and food  then 5 more for the rest of the order hash browns sausage muffin soda nothing extra or fancy
25377,2,When this McDonalds first opened OMG it was cool seeing the zoo theme The animatronics made noise and moved The service WAS excellent But now it looks like a tourist trap Some days youll sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking spot Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain its quality that it had As far as the food goes Well its McDonalds same as any other
24319,2,Chicken nuggets were ice cold and disgusting the French fries it was like they poured 12 bucket of salt on them This is not the first time Ive encountered cold overly salted food
18345,2,My wife watched the lady cleaning the bathroom take the mop bucket straight to the lobby where she mopped the floor then the bench where people sit Same water same mop same bucket disgusting
21242,2,After ordering my food and waiting for over 10 minutes to get it Coffee was luke warm I went back to get fresh cup and I was handed a cup that had been sitting on the counter I told the young lady that it wasnt hot either and she said that it was the normal temperature of their coffee I finally got her to pour me a fresh hot cup This is definitely not the place to go to for fast food
11688,2,Coffee is average and to sweet
16270,2,Poor 
12325,2,Good for a quick stop
24876,2,About half of my visits are pretty terrible but its a drive thru option thats on my way to work  Today my bacon egg and cheese bagel had no bacon  899 for a missing ingredient is absolutely ridiculous
13883,2,This place was cool However with Covid right now no one had control of anything There was not spaced out seating People were on top of each other None of the employees seemed to care that there was no social distancing I was expecting some type of Covid policy to be in place and there was for staff But they seemed to care less about the people who visited I will never be going back here again
13331,2,My visit was just to get a gift card and this location is very unorganized Not clean in the dining room area at all
17624,2,Decent service
21238,2,Not the best experience Manager was very rude and didnt rectify the situation which ultimately ended up being a customer service and quality of product issue She could have easily made it right but failed to do so I will no longer visit this McDonalds and I urge others to avoid it like the plague There are plenty of other fast food restaurants in the area that are worth visiting
24877,2,"Ive been ordering from this location via Uber Eats for a couple of years  They are no longer able serve an acceptable Breakfast Burrito
OLD CRUNCHY NUKED TO THE PAPER WRAPPING   Why  It cant be laziness  Its their business  training poor  EVERY TIME all other items are fine except for this item"
18373,2,Took 20 minutes inside this morning for 1 sausage  bisquit  Food was OK Warm
16256,2,Poor 
22712,2,I only stopped there because my dog likes their chicken nuggets
23825,2,The morning crew is professional to they are a stellar group  but the midnight shift is horrible food is cold desserts were squashed and when I showed them the muffins she saidthats how they came out
12427,2,Long lines
21268,2,One of the worst MC D I have even been The place was not clean and the server messed up our order
20516,2,They always seem to make you feel like you are inconveniencing them by being there
18302,2,We go to this McDonalds because they had a really cool electronic board that the kids could play on it was interactive and very neat well for the last five times they tell us the board is broke we only get a drink there Im so we only go to for the play area and since its broke my son has been very sad
13987,2,I thought I had experienced a few disorganized McDonalds before now This is a whole new level of bad management One hour wait time for a normal order plus a pizza  The employees seem to all be very busy and there are plenty of them too This leads me to believe management are not equipped to handle a location this size and either needs training or needs 
17662,2,It was cold in there
12402,2,Ok
24806,2,Took an hour and a half to get food but friendly staff
13356,2,I had a fly in my mc flurryand i got yelled at about it  im sorry last i checked the customer was right
20492,2,You know those moments when youre looking for a way to kill massive amounts time Visit this place Seriously one visit and youll understand
11585,2,Told me to pull around and wait for order They forgot about me They werent busy
18301,2,The service at this McDonalds is always spotty this time they made my iced latte a hot latte not a big deal but they consistently mess up the orders and I love McDonalds in general
24808,2,In almost all McDonalds I have been going have self order post The bad news is when the machine freezes up you have to go at front and ask for help right No help you need to l look ace the order again
18447,2,The fries were not cooked some were still ice cold inside
24814,2,Slow service and attendents dont acknowledge customersI ate there multiple times since it was close to where I was saying and could get a quick bite to eat but it was slow
23730,2,It took us 20 mins to get to order and get our drinksSo slowvery disappointing
13304,2,The girl taking orders couldnt understand even after I drove up to the windowat the end my order was wrong as usual
24902,2,"I was helped by two different people  Neither one said thank you Or anything at all Just shoved receipts and food in my face

Updating my review  Weeks later and this is still the case"
24817,2,THE SLOWEST AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE Definitely not coming back
25436,2,Always something with this location Either system down only cash or sometimes no respond on the drive thru at nights
21215,2,"What is it with McDonalds I made an a order the cashier made a mistake told me to drive around again

I spoke to the Manager he waived the fee on the mix up of menu then we sat outside 15 minutes in Las Vegas heat waiting for the food

This place may be good for a walk in not drive through

Its a simple order how are is it to get it right

2 stars due to waiv"
24813,2,Fries were very cold childrens burgers were creased as if once wrapped they were smashed with something service wasnt terrible but food put out was
18456,2,Orders are always wrong staff is unfriendly and slow
16229,2,Poor 
18299,2,Order some food and they forgot to give me  my Cheeseburgers I always check the bag before I leave I told them and the girl said it was in thereI told her you want to come and check
18476,2,Got order wrong  Grunt a here ya go
21305,2,Came at 2am and the chicken nuggets tasted stale Had likely been sitting there for awhile I wouldnt have minded waiting longer for a fresh batch but perhaps they were expecting a rush and wanted to get rid of old food
17543,2,Food isnt to good
18475,2,They are overpriced and had no condiments
17544,2,Staff not pleasant everyone seemed miserable
12424,2,the fries were
17546,2,I always feel sad after eating here
18470,2,almost always wrong but super nice staff
12284,2,Rude customer servicesmartasses
22702,2,Service was fine but why cold burgers and worse again cold fries
13831,2,Big disappointment They closed 2nd floor area at 930pm so didnt get to see upstairs Nuggets were smaller and drier than usual and they forgot half our order but they were nice about it Oh well cant expect much in this super touristy area
17664,2,Poor service
11570,2,I didnt get order how dose it work
22704,2,Didnt include pineapple with my deluxe breakfast even though it shows in the picture
24907,2,This McDonalds needs to improve  The facility is good and updated The food service is slow  They also mess up our orders often at drivethrough in particular It appears that the employee turnaround is high so I dont really see regular employees here for long
18296,2,The ladies restroom smell horrible Moldy and mildewy smell Very very strong smell that I could smell through my mask
24797,2,Got nuggets and fries Asked for barbeque and ketchup for the fries Got no barbeque or ketchup good thing we went to the big mcdonalds enjoying dry nuggets now At least the food was hot
13294,2,Good location and friendly staff  but lots of homeless people in and around the restaurant
18298,2,Charged me for someone else who already drove offs meal Then got my order wrong Spent 20 minutes for fast food in the drive thru
12388,2,Classic fast food
21269,2,One of the worst run McDonalds Chaos inside The order kiosks were only partially working long wait times and at least 4 people had problems with their orders Needs a lot of attention
12387,2,Extremly slow
11605,2,Service and food quality are inconsistent
18313,2,The manager did not have all the equipment working the order was messed up and they did not have the option to do Google or Apple pay or take credit cards or scan anything on the McDonalds app
11635,2,Bathroom smells like an exhibit at the zoo
15721,2,They have messed up my order multiple times
24331,2,When I first pulled up to get breakfast at 533am the man told me to come back in 10mins I said what is this You mean I cant order food right now Yall start breakfast from 5am and go until 11am He said ok you can order but food wont be ready for at least 5min What was weird is soon as I ordered my food was already ready This particular McDonalds is way to busy and big to be pulling slack workers like that The guy seemed like he just didnt want to help
12371,2,Incredibly understaffed
23750,2,Drive thru is not what it use to be They take far to long to be fast food because I thought it suppose to be 30 seconds And half the time they mess up my order
18421,2,They are fast but they almost always screw up your order
11639,2,The McRib started my downhill spiral
24307,2,Every vehicle that ordered was told to move into a parking space to wait for their food Why not just allow everyone to wait at the window if service is so slow The other thing that set me off is they had a lady in her late 70s bring the food out She did so with a loving warm smile but I only hope they take care of her when the younger fit employees clock in No offense she was a sweet heart just worried
11640,2,Same food consistently everyday
16296,2,Cashier on turn Apr3023 at 952a pretend didnt hear when when I asked twice please repeat the order just told me go to the next window of course the order was wrong
13317,2,Went twice to order a big order of food and both times our food was not ready on time and the large orders were not done correctly Something was missing on both occassions
11643,2,Slowest drive thru ever
11644,2,I would not return a second time
12369,2,No drive thru 
17575,2,Customer service extremely poor
15724,2,Last time I went womens bathroom was nasty as hell scared to sit on toliet with the toliet seat covers
22332,2,I ran here to grab my wife some breakfast one morning We had grown tired of the spam sushi and other Hawaiian delicacies and wanted some good ol fast food breakfast I ordered the hot cake meal and a McGriddle I returned to the hotel to find they didnt give me syrup Upon returning they tried to charge me a quarter for the syrup they forgot
11730,2,two stars
25406,2,Food was definitely not even close to being fresh ishand the location although youd think is convenient after visiting the zoo  Its a wreck waiting to happen if you try to drive in to their location
18427,2,Order taker was the most rude I have ever encountered anywhere
21278,2,Im giving 2 starts because we went there last week and was hard to order our food using the machine they have some are not working the security guy didnt help few workers only took us a while to wait for our food also you cant eat inside only outside and the tables they have outside doesnt have enough shade with those high temperatures and eat outside is not recommended I will recommend them if they are not allowing to eat inside a least shade the table outside
21291,2,It was dirty and spills on the floor were still there after I ate The tables were dirty and the workers there were rude to other customers THEY WERE VERY RUDE
12294,2,Very slow
12295,2,Not good
11609,2,Below average by McDonalds standards
13309,2,Not the best one I have been in Time in line was long and food was wrong Disgusting bathroom
25431,2,Awful experience It was 1015 and I needed a sweet tea and nuggets I order my tea in the drive through line The line was pretty long When I got to the window to pay the cashier with light brown eyes said they could only take cash I said what I have stayed in this line this long and no one said a word I said for my inconvenience I would like to have the tea She looked strange and I said please let me speak to your manager She spoke to someone and the manager said no and wouldnt come to the window AWFUL
13972,2,Very nice staff but the reason Im writing this review with 2 stars is because of the fish tank They have a fish tank here overcrowded with African cichlids an aggressive type of fish who will chase each other around nip at each other and other fish and sometimes even kill them They have one Bala shark which is a very peaceful schooling fish who should be in a group of at LEAST 4 other Bala sharks Schooling fish can die from stress in some cases if they are alone  He is being nipped at his fins are torn and he gets about 16 inches long full grown There are Plecos that also get about 24 inches long full grown in there too I didnt know who was in charge I asked but apparently someone comes in to take care of them I love the staff here I just want to make sure their fish are being taken care of and happy Itanld be very happy in there  Keep in mind the rule of fish is every inch of fish think about how big they will be full grown should have at least one gallon if not two gallons of water to swim around in The cichlids alone get anywhere between 68 inches and I couldnt even count how many there is in there Bala sharks are schooling fish and get about 1618 inches and Plecos get about 24 inches long and they get very wide as well V
24336,2,"This particular McDonalds was incredibly slow

My chicken sandwich was overcooked and dry and they didnt put the pickles on it

Overall it took over 15 minutes in the drive through to get my food

Not a great showing from a place that is not expected to be great"
20502,2,"Very very slow
Good coffee though
But very slow service"
13847,2,half of the stuff on the menu was unavailable  the upstairs was closed granted i did visit around 1112pm the janitor was moping the same spot for 15 minutes and my burger patty was hard and a little burnt  I would come back though cause it
22298,2,Extremely disapointing Skip the line didnt have pay working at time of ordering got lucky with the counter for it to be empty so we could pay right away Let me order something that wasnt available and didnt ask if something else was okay just changed it No unsweetened tee either but would let you order
11619,2,Slowest McDonalds I have ever visited
15714,2,We went to the drive thru today and they mest up all our order
18433,2,The music they play suck please get rid of it put some 50s 60s and 70s
24306,2,This is my first time coming here and they made our order perfect then we ordered a waffle and we waited 1 hour for the waffle and the worker had the audacity to say do still want to wait for the waffle or a refund I said a refund and I was mad while walking out I don
13313,2,Bad service gave us sparkling water instead of sprite also it takes about 45 minutes to just get a vanila cone and your food
24829,2,They cant handle a lot of customer Waited 10 minutes for my order outside
24832,2,So they can ring you up at the counter but you have to order through those machines Ugh Place smells like disinfectant and bleach charges tourist prices
18429,2,Always crowded but not because the service and food is good but because badly staffed Day and night
15713,2,I used to come by here fairly often but its gone downhill The one on 183 by Walmart is better
11391,2,The people that work here are very rude I am super polite to them and they are still rude
11390,2,This location wasnt even packed when I pulled into the drive thru They forgot my fries and didnt put in barbeque sauce  The food wasnt even warm after it was handed to me
23925,2,Well dont ask them for a cup of ice you might be lucky to get six cubes
22633,2,Long waiting period with lots of peopleThey should have more staff at waikiki branch
22187,2,I cant believe they dont have public restroom There was security that can monitor or only allow customers with receipts Isnt it again health laws to not have a restroom
24016,2,Not the best place to go your  Older is never right
22396,2,Service is painfully slow even when its not busy Staff have no sense of urgency Customers regularly ask for refund after waiting too long for their orders Expect to wait 1525 minutes just to get your order
21463,2,The food was good as usual but the restrooms were very very dirty so disappointing dirty tables we had to clean with antibacterial wipes
18811,2,Poor 
20150,2,Poor 
12209,2,Fries wss cold food made me got to bathroom constantly
15531,2,The burgers are constantly underdone but the manager is usually ok with exchanging them Originally they would try to explain its a temp cook and I had to tell them I can
20161,2,Poor 
15536,2,Over cooked chicken over salted fries wrong drinks
24010,2,Slowest McDonalds in the world and cold french fries
15537,2,Unpleasantly warm inside its a warm day in December the mens bathroom was disgusting They couldnt sell me a hot fudge sundae because they were out of fudge On the positive side my hamburger met expectations
20166,2,Poor 
14258,2,Im visiting from Florida and this is the second time try the drive thru and it has been extremely slow Only for an after school treat
14257,2,Workers were not so pleasant to be around and my burger was not fresh Ive worked several fast food jobs I made sure freshness was top priority

11934,2,Only stop here if you have to
12681,2,I considered 3 stars for the food temperature hotbut giving I waited 26 mn in line  I was not accepting anything less Im not sure of the cause but clearly this location needs a time assessment
18843,2,Poor 
12680,2,Currently its drivethru only and this is the second time that they forget items on my order This time I decided to return to get my full meal as ordered Unfortunately I found that this would cost me more in time and frustration I need a new franchise close to me
21173,2,Tried there mc latte coffee asked for iced one gave me hot and didnt want to replace it  The coffee was too sweet and not good tasting overall probably wont take again mc coffee customer service in this location can get better
11180,2,crowded dirty frantic fast service but your order may not be correct
11181,2,There is no free refill in this place  But u can use mobile app for cheaper order
22182,2,"I rarely eat fast food but yes it was open late and we needed food
Only one ordering computer open such a large restaurant limited to such a small area and no bathroom Really makes no sense
Super slow service and the people that come here are super questionable One guy was so far gone I dont think he knew he was at McDonald"
17301,2,I got dinner at the drive through tonight and got 2 orders of the bacon cheese fries when I got home and opened them there was a smallest amount of cheese and no bacon at all I also got an Oreo McFlurry and was handed it with the lid halfway off and it wasnt mixed when I asked if it was gonna her mixed she said not yet than finally took it back and mixed it all while looking very c
16512,2,How do you mess up this many orders And the fries were weird Just go to a different McDonalds
15527,2,Nice place clean but got 2 stars Always during lunch it gets packed and they have a way to order your food yourself now me being me I would help out bit when its always asked in a rude way to order your meal back there I cannot accept They need more help there obviously Sorry McDonalds but needs to change there tactics on time management and other stuff aside from that a gentleman behind me did not get to order because he didnt place his order by himself but neither did i No bueno
15528,2,I went at 6am and I understand not everyone is  a morning person but geezshe kept cutting me off and was very short with me and I was in a great mood but sadly her attitude got to me and ruined my morning Disappointed with morning staff or at least this lady individually
20117,2,Poor 
18826,2,Poor 
11930,2,Dirty no ice for drinks and a lot of food nat available
20136,2,Poor 
14271,2,The lady didnt do my order correctly an she got upset when I asked for the correct items
11928,2,Ordered two Mcdoublesone with ketchup only the other plain The one with ketchup was so messy you couldnt even handle it and the other wasnt plain The order was printed correctly on the receipt Are these employees just not able to read
24450,2,The service was TOTALLY slow and it took the clerk about 5 minutes before they could even take an order  Im a local and I wouldnt ever go back to this location again Seemed like a LOT of chaos happening when I looked in the kitchen area  Also clerks do NOT have a basic understanding of English This is difficult if youre trying to ask anything of the clerk  Would not recommend
23999,2,At least they got my order right
18847,2,Poor 
21176,2,Went last evening Not hardly any business and was helped quickly SUPER friendly and great service which gets this two stars Hey  its McDonalds It wouldnt get above four stars even if it was perfect for a McDonalds meal lol Just not that good The issue was the OJ and apple fritters I dont love spending 4 f
13152,2,At first I felt hungry so I went to this very fancy Mickey Ds  But then while getting back home  which was a long way from the Santa Monica Pier  I felt nostalgic and my stomach was hurting really bad  So I had to stop at Carls Jr on  Newhall for the bathroom
22641,2,Ive stopped visiting this location due to HPD involvementits complicated Civil rights violations
12651,2,Unfortunately food was cold and was missing a lot of things
17332,2,the heavy set woman with the short cut quick weave with glasses is very rude and miserable looking  i stood there waiting on the doordash order for 20 min and she didnt ask how could she help me she didnt say anything  she was skipping over the doordash order  and just let me stand there then when the order was done she threw the bag
11225,2,Two stars just for the brand but let me be real here the staff needs training in this location Customer service not good Every time when I go there is a long wait Im talking about waiting over 20 minutes or more to get your order and the bad thing is there is not a lot of customers to have this long wait Maybe they are always cooking everything from scratch  I almost forgot to mention the funny part one day I was a hurry and could not stop my scooter so I went to the drive through and the lady told me on the speaker mamm please come inside we do not serve people on scooters on drive through  I was so upset and could not find a place to lock my scooter and I gave up on the whole mac thing I just go there because my daughter likes to eat Md   You can also find some homeless and  junkies from the beach gathering inside to use restrooms  Maybe just because is the beach area I suppose 
23989,2,Customer service pm is awful on morning  regularly personnel is better
13168,2,Too many homeless hang out in front of here A lot of them are violent No drink refills here because people would take cups out of the trash and steal soda
18211,2,Went through the drive thru in a hurry to get my daughter to school we found a hair in our food and was given the wrong drink The manager on duty was very apologetic and gave me a refund Even though I was disappointed with the hair in the food we were treated very kindly and had no problem getting our money back
18744,2,Poor 
12653,2,Very slow compared to other McDonalds Very cheap Ran out of coke no box for my happy meal 3 different crack heads came up to me begging
13400,2,this McDonalds was full of homeless people and they had a security guard at the door and there was no place to sit because all the homeless people had all the tables
17343,2,Predictable Mediocre food Arrogant manager Incompetent staff They dropped part of my order did not charge me for it and woukd not restore it And got sauces wrong
16477,2,Like stepping back into the 70s this place hasnt been updated for many decades by the looks of it Very old fashioned Food a little greasy and saltier than other McDonalds branches Ive been to
18730,2,Poor 
23979,2,Thats all you get Service is mediocre
17347,2,Missing item from my order I call them tell them that one of my item is missing They offer me to come back to get it but I am 2 miles away I am not coming back for it
17348,2,This Mcds is average Ok service with ok food Nothing exceptional with this McdsOnly positive is they seem to be slightly faster than most but on a negative I ask for a type of salad dressing I usually get the wrong dressing Happened multiple times
17349,2,First YOU have to place YOUR order on the kiosk Then wait almost 20 minutes for your food because everyone is taking care of the drivethru Lol I went in trying to avoid the long line at the drivethru and ended up waiting longer
24430,2,Inconsistency on preparing my daily French vanilla latte Some times perfect sometimes bitter sometimes similar to the much less expensive regular black  Also very inconsistent on getting special orders correct Very friendly crew
21444,2,The food was ok but way over priced for a McDonalds and the fries had no flavor  I dont suggest it
21450,2,My hot n spicy was thrown in the bag outside of the paper And it wasnt even hot it was like room temp
11903,2,Probably the worst McDonalds restaurant I know They cant manage to get any orders right and Ive sat in their drive thru on several occasions for a few minutes with nobody covering it Terrible
16486,2,Today 3182022 restaurant is closed for renovation no date when will reopen but Google maps shows as open
15542,2,There was no one men the drive through i came back three times I love McDonalds I have been going there since i was very young I hope things change for the better at this location
23994,2,Yuck
18792,2,Poor 
13694,2,My kids wanted to check this McDonalds location largest McDonalds but they forgot to add slowest service ever in the fast food industry in their description We waited 55 minutes for our order The staff was calm  patient despite all of the unhappy people who were waited for almost an hour for their orders as well To whomever is running this location please get your staff the proper help that they need I
18789,2,Poor 
11913,2,Very slow We were one of two cars we were asked to go to the third window where we waited while the car behind us got their food then another car Our order One mcdouble One double quarter pounder meal Thats it Then the fries are cold If they had competition in champlain they would not be doing well
18784,2,Poor 
13695,2,Very crowded It is hard to find a table Many seatings are removed for unknown reasons My order took literally 30 minutes to be ready The sundaes were half melted If you just need some fast food there are a lot of choices in the area
13696,2,"Checked this off my list

What
I thought id have to check out the biggest play area at a McDonalds I actually have lived in Orlando for over 15 years and today was the first time I went Upon reading some review I just realized it is the largest and an actual tourist attraction I took a toddler her to play and BOY what an experience

Environment
This is right off a busy intersection iDrive and sand lake The parking can get packed The building is huge You cannot miss it It is 2 stories and the play area is quite big as well with an arcade inside There are 2 stories you enter the play area on level 2 You order the food downstairs and you can sit upstairs There are a lot of self ordering machines so it makes ordering go a little faster Upstairs was VERY HOT Like there was no AC and when you walk downstairs it was cool

Niceness of the staff
Barely had any interactions with the staff It was ok

Dollar
They also sell pizza and that was ok it starts at 9 and every topping is at least 1

Yes
Probably not not really recommended"
21454,2,It Was OK
18203,2,Delivery complete joke Dont bother taking the time to order sauces for your Nuggets I ordered 20 spicy  40 reg picked out at least 9 different dipping sauces as required  not to mention Desired by my kiddos We did NOT get ONE sauce or even a ketchup Just to make sure they were consistant with disregard they didnt even give us straws either to go with our 3 mango smoothies2 of them So 60 NuggetsNO sauces  AT ALL  Not the first time they have done us wrong on the Nuggets so buyer should be cautious
20211,2,Poor 
14243,2,They are very slow and also no dine inn They also forgot my damn sweet n sour
15888,2,Come on guys You are on duty
20224,2,Poor 
14242,2,This is the third time i ask for unsweet tea and i get sweet tea  They even repeat unsweet tea and have it on the screen as unsweet tea Folks arent the brightest crayons in the box 
16488,2,The McDonalds I just went to was so filthy I didnt even eat there The parking lot was disgusting all around the outside of the building was really filthy Inside was better but not by that much
20225,2,Poor 
11218,2,I havent been to a McDonalds in years but the prices are way up 27 for a small breakfast fo
24442,2,Theres only 1 way to describe my experience Have you ever gone in to a daycare and shook a basket full of babies well I havent but I could imagine what it sounds like and thats how it sounded when I walked in the doors I didnt order anything and the employees were on there phones anyways So 
15876,2,No cashiers
14279,2,Worst McDonalds experience Meat was old and 
22798,2,A disappointing visit We ordered using the kiosk since no one was manning the counter cash register We waited over 20 minutes for 3 standard combo meals and no one else was inside the restaurant The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders While waiting we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it At that point I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didnt realize it hadnt been served We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for The staff completely ignored us until we asked why our order was cleared without getting anything They did make our order fresh once we asked for it which is why I gave more that 1 star for the food We would not return to this location
21164,2,Waited about half an hour for my food Never been at such a slow McDonald
22800,2,Not only was it packed and slow moving but our mobile app that said ready in 35 minutes actually tool close to 15 minutes A BIG thing was having to pay to have a refill on your drink That is ridiculous
15510,2,Line moved ridiculously slow tonight and food wasnt hot  Not always the case but that was my experience tonight
19989,2,Poor 
23551,2,Waited 30 minutes in drive thru line be told they are out of fish and chicken
23552,2,"I was there to separate times one time I paid over 2 more than the second
time and got the exact same thing"
13119,2,No drive thru there is a parking lot area very busy and chaotic service was reasonable
20015,2,Poor 
11151,2,Sooo dirty Used the bathroom after I ate and I felt like I needed a full shower afterwards
12707,2,Slowest McDonalds weve been to Theyre usually so fast so we decided to stop here when in a hurry This one was very slow
24460,2,On Saturday at 1125am drive through is moving at 4 to 5 minutes per car which works out to about 30 to 35 minutes to get your food from when order was placed Also only use lane 1 and you will go faster
18918,2,Poor 
20025,2,Poor 
20032,2,Poor 
17271,2,Usually come here because they have their stuff together Today was the exact opposite Hit the drive through for 2 things and it took over 30 minutes Had to wait in the parking lot for a big mac meal and a happy meal
17272,2,I just ordered from door dash and this McDonalds sent my sons hotcakes with no butter or syrup They didnt even send jelly for the biscuits Just disappointed thats all Have a good day
11952,2,On the rare occasion my family stops here the order ALWAYS gets screwed up More often than not its the drive thru that screws up The kiosk is cool and the game on a table is fun but that in no way makes up for the lack of attention to orders My rare visits will become even more rare
22403,2,The busiest McDonalds Ive ever 
13337,2,"Unsafe experience
Lots of homeless people inside and outA few even smoking weed
Place was too dirty"
17265,2,This used to be a great store But recently they cant make frappes Sad to not be able to fill 
18950,2,Poor 
23548,2,Weird credit card layout tea was hot 34 of a cup filled up and bland would skip this McDonald
17257,2,"Ordered via the kiosk

Looks like management has posted a sign order via kiosk to get a free cookie My order didnt contain one I asked the associate she was puzzled They had to discuss with 3 other folks and finally one of them gave one with complete displeasure

Kiosk didnt give a paper bill to provide a direct feedback With modern tech they should switch to a sms or email for whoever wants a digital copy"
11140,2,No veggie option that is a mess today
11955,2,Poor service it took over 40 minutes for our food The workers were more concerned with the drive thru Nobody was working the front register or paying attention
18977,2,Poor 
22624,2,Staff was not friendly  food was marginal and slow no bathroom
22138,2,McD on the Strip Near Welcome Sign has two belowaverage features a cattle barnlike atmosphere and employees who go down to the basement to smile But the prices are world class
15906,2,Basic McDonalds with basic products and overpriced offerings
11954,2,The service was okay today and the staff was friendly I still had to pull up to wait for someone to bring out a simple order This location is routinely slow in processing drive thru orders  Im talking 15 minutes or more I wouldnt order anything there within an hour of closing I was once served an Egg McMuffin on a biscuit with a folded egg Some friends ordered 10 McFlurries and each cup was less than half full like they rationed it out  This is probably one of the most disappointing and poorly run locations You dont mind paying twice as much for a coffee at the Dunkin next door because the McDonalds is sooooo slow
23542,2,The people working here are not friendly  Went through the drive through and the only only thing said to me was my total
21484,2,Too dependant on technology Cashiers expect you to use kiosk No team members at registers
23544,2,Somehow they forgot to give us our orderno big deal I needed the exercise and they did apologize
13416,2,Food was not good  Friendly service from team members
15506,2,I cant tell you how much I have the new kiosk system of ordering The employees couldnt care less if you have ordered or need to order and that goes for the managers also Everyone is only worried about what the lazy people in the drivethrough are ordering And to make matters worse if you want to pay with cash you get to order twice What a stupid idea why not just give me a place to do all the work myself like Fuddruckers
19981,2,Poor 
24986,2,They mixed up on my order no sausage or syrup had to go back to ask for it
24267,2,This is easily the worst McDonalds experience Ive had Waiting an hour for fast food in what can only be described as a dirty chaotic nightmare Staff are totally disorganised and management seems nonexistent Only getting 2 stars because when we eventually forced them to cook our food as we waited blocking the counter it was piping hot and pretty delicious
11145,2,Very disorganized I was given the wrong order then given an incomplete order after Only plus side to this McDonalds is the cheap food
23545,2,"Food was cold
Service could of been better"
11146,2,The place in Google said open 24 hs we went there by 11 pm and it was closed
13411,2,Too many weird people around the crew its tough with customers and sometimes the food comes to you cold
22174,2,"SLOW service I ordered a spam egg over rice platter as soon as I arrived to the store and waited 20 min

It was delish tho"
15512,2,Dirty dining room Beverage station needed to be wiped down  Trash cans were overflowing  Roaches Floors needed cleaning And no They were not too busy to clean We were their only customers other than the 1 car at the drive thru and we saw at least 6 employees
22150,2,Used the delivery to table option Waited for 30 minutes  When my food didnt come i walked up to the counter and ot had been sitting in the back for who knows how long Trash was over flowing they eventually locked the Mai Entry door with no sign up to slow down the in coming customers it was a busy night Im pretty sure this was a fire hazard
11939,2,Went for the coffee which was fine But also ordered a breakfast sandwich and a hash brown They had an excessive amount of grease Couldnt finish it
20065,2,Poor 
18879,2,Poor 
11171,2,Order was wrong and waiting far too long for fast food on ly good thing was the milkshake
24454,2,Sorely disappointed Outlets in every wall and not a single one working The girl at counter looked at me like I was dumb the entire time I tried to order and seemed like she didnt have a clue how to answer any question I asked The guy sweeping the lobby was very cordial and actually tried to warn me none of the outlets worked so kudos to him Place was clean enough I guess
22399,2,Staff are super rude and uninterestedunmotivated Got our order wrong a few times which is fine but its all in the way you go about it Restaurant itself was clean enough which was good
22398,2,My wife and I went to this McDonalds while on vacation in Waikii The person taking my order apparently did not understand English as she totally screwed up my order I dont ask much just be able to understand what Im saying Hawaii is still in America after all The food was as expected Ok at best But that our first and only trip there
11937,2,"The french fries were stale

Edit dropped one more star it was noon only car in drive through ordered a double cheeseburger and fries Got to the window from there they sent me to there 3rd window  where i sat for 10mins until i got my food The fries were half full and stale The cheeseburger was good though"
22401,2,Super busy which is understandable given the location Currently only open for take out Oh well
24668,2,extremely busyhighly understaffed waited 1 hr in drive thru last resort for my food this is not fast food
11936,2,Stopped here at the Champlain location for a quick bite while on my way home The service was extremely slow The employee tasked with serving the food to customers walked out and took several minutes to return and upon return took several more minutes to serve the food The food was subpar as well My recommendation is to avoid
20693,2,Slow service
12686,2,Went for a pick up and took over 20 minutes to get the food Three other customers got there after me and got their food before me
24049,2,Very slow service today
23576,2,They need more happy people in there and people to actually Acknowledge there guest and smile  Its horrible to feel like your a bother as a customer when your spending your hard earned working money at your restaurant  NOT GOOD for the business at all especially when your a regular  This needs attention Immediately to earn the peoples business
17299,2,burgers are like rubbers they taste awful i felt i am eating not fresh bread chicken was stretchy  looks like it was made to last for ever
11178,2,Not very good lines some guy cussing thought he was first behind me a ways not so fun with a kid
16521,2,Dining room has gnats Told employee but no reaction Maybe the gnats amoing others is why i raely go Was in a giant hurry only reason
18868,2,Poor 
14297,2,Too expensive for fast food that isnt very good Not always fresh
17292,2,I work around the corner from this particular location My coworkers were all excited to see the newly renovated location I usually dont get fast food but I really wanted a milkshake before work How do you redo the entire building but you still dont have any milkshakes I shouldve taken the extra drive and gone to Chick fil A
12695,2,Fries were cold service ok the kiosk machine wasnt working right this place needs a change in it been like this for a long time Better service and fresher food
24066,2,Long line at drive thru
16542,2,Bad customer service rude they lie about giving u condiments Food is usually missing when u get home
21470,2,Not gonna lie i only gave it 2 stars because we couldnt eat inside other than that service n food were on point good Mcdonalds
18172,2,Frys were cold did not give me my large drink that was ordered and when I asked for my receipt 3 people just walked around lost said forget it and left
12200,2,Long wait for food not very clean inside
21167,2,Most incompetent McDonalds Ive ever been to Service is incredibly slow Orders are constantly messed up Always out of ice cream Homeless girl inside asking all the patrons for money
17289,2,"I was not given a receipt otherwise I wouldve complained privately

I pulled into the drive thru around 250 PM It was about a one or two minute wait before me and the woman in the second drive thru lane were answered Before that someone must have accidentally switched their headset on because all I heard was a lot of laughing and talking in the background

When I pulled around to pay the woman at the first window wasnt able to locate my order for a moment But she triple checked to make sure that what she had was accurate So I paid received my change and she shut the window without another word or my receipt

I pull up to the next window to get my food and drinks The girl at that window double checked which order was mine then handed me my food Even though I ordered a large Coke I was given a medium Coke but didnt see any use in complaining because I didnt want to hold her lane up

When I pulled away I started eating my medium fry only to discover that the top fries were over salted and mushy I figured they mustve got mixed in with the fresh fries and kept eating I was wrong They only got worse They got mushier and more stale Like someone had reheated them in a microwave Absolutely disgusting I was too annoyed at that point to turn around and go all the way back I dont expect fries to be perfect all the time but I do expect not to get the fries that shouldve been written off as waste

The only reason that Im doing 2 stars instead of 1 is because the teens here are very nice They go above and beyond to make sure everything is okay Especially when Im inside using the kiosk But something about food quality and drive thru efficiency needs to be revamped This isnt the first time Ive received stale fries or had an order done incorrectly at this location I only come here because this is the only McDonalds on my route that doesnt put me out of the way but the lack of efficiency is seriously frustrating"
25603,2,Food was cold as their heart And the classic they forgot to add the barbecue
11948,2,Give the wrong burger  i asked  for double qpounder  and drive half mile and find I didnt get right sandwiches And drive delivery parts couldnt turn around after I kind when out my way to get a bit to eat But hop they put right one in the box the next time
11159,2,Ordered an apple pie at 203p and ate it at 230p only to relize it expired at 150p It was hard and cold

20054,2,Poor 
14303,2,Ketchup dispenser empty 2days on a row napkin dispenser empty have to ask for napkins to get them Very very slow service inside
22154,2,A busy hot mess with all the dessert drinks sold out service is slow as ever
13648,2,We were so excited to go here the kids were all excited and we traveled a few hours to get here and it wasnt that great They were out of a lot of food they had no desserts except for apple pie that all McDonalds offer They advertise chocolate cake and ice cream but when you go there the counter was shut down The big huge play area was shut down so no kids play area Also they had an arcade area that was fun but the big prize area where you cash in your t
25164,2,Poor 
24665,2,"Ordered the Quarter pounders deluxe with cheese no pickle and one with no onion
They both had no lettuce and tomato on them I call them about it and they were glad to replace them I go back and 10mims later we get hot fries and two sandwiches but both had onions and pickles on them
nevergetitright McDonalds"
21469,2,Sketchy area Drunk hobos passed out on the outside tables in the middle of the day
14313,2,Always slow service from how it takes before someone takes your order to when you food comes out
15558,2,Extremely slow service Staff unorganized and rude No gravy for mashed potatoes and they were old and cold macaroni overcooked Truly worst experience ever Not worth the e tra effort made to drive there and wait for fresh chicken
24676,2,Past 2 recent visits my order has been incorrect and required remakes  They have a lot of employees and all are doing their own thing  Not an example of fast food
16475,2,Gross bathrooms you know its sketchy because they have security outside of it
17695,2,same as always
11331,2,Being this particular McDonalds is close to the beach one should come to expect that service would be more efficient Not this one Ray Kroc would be rolling in his grave if he saw thisThe cheese on my  sausage McMuffin seems plastic also wait Luke warm coffee  attitude to go with it There seems to be lots of friction between them and some some of the clients that come in there namely the homeless  Not all but some of the staff  was extremely rude to them refusing them service and treating them subhuman Shame on the manager I have been raised on Mc D
15606,2,"Was looking at menu to see what I wanted and was told in loud voice I cannot order there use the kiosk
I stated I was looking to see what I want then use kiosk
I was then screamed at and told to go to the kiosk
Nice customer service"
25262,2,Poor 
11336,2,"Worst service ever at a McDonalds
People waiting to order and the manager and crew wouldnt even look at us or tell us to wait After ordering I had to ask for my food they just left it there on top of the fryer"
13762,2,I came to this McDonalds expecting at least some decent food and service judging by the fact they were just switching over to lunch but got met with some poor service from staff and mediocre quality coming from the food I asked one of the staff tall skinny lady with curly hair upfront if I could get my food cooked to order and she gave a slight nod as a response which I found extremely rude then moved over to the kitchen area so I decided to ask ANOTHER manager upfront and she was actually quite nice and went straight to telling the people in the kitchen and the moment she did the manager I had previously spoken to decided to turn around and say the slight remark You already told me I got it thanks which I found very rude coming from what youerd to my surprise yet not so surprised self I received very mildly warm food it tasted and was very obviously sitting there for longer than I wouldve liked  it didnt meet my simple request of 
12583,2,The service was very poor I order 5 deluxe 3 coffees 2 orange juices and 2 extra sauges and from that order we didnt got the coffee stirrups no forks no straws no ketup no syrup for pancakes and no extra sauces that I paid for we had to go ask them for everything we need it
15837,2,Not enough workers fries old food took to long
17418,2,Bought FOUR items here and they forgot one I am still confused as to how you can mess up on only four items After this visit I am really concerned about our nations education system 
13216,2,If you can handle the homeless people attacking you then its awesome
16401,2,"The drive thru girl lied to me and the mgr stepped in to assist and the next time I went there I started out happy and said hi
She did not answerwierdo

Not cool to hold grudges  I dont  Every day is a new day and a chance to clean up messes  She could fix it and apologize but she chooses to ack like a child"
11342,2,While using kiosk it made many selections for me I did not choose Had to delete many things from order got frustrated and just put it in It was too busy at the counter for the personnel to answer my question she informed me there were customers in front of me Being hungry and tired this was more frustrating than it should have been
11819,2,Drive in offers badly written communication difficult
15613,2,Placed an order for pick up through the app They were Rude didnt give me a receipt and walked off when I asked for one
11344,2,Very slow service beside expected business during the late night I would not recommend if you would like to get your food quickly during late night weekends It is as if they do not prepare for the late night rush
14167,2,I no longer will be going to this McDonalds on my commute from San Antonio to Kerrville once or twice a week  I was there today  and this is not the first time its happened I ordered one thing and receive something not even close to what I ordered Im always in a hurry so I forget to check the bag I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich combo and when I finally was able to open the bag and opened the container I had a bacon cheeseburger with onions on it not happy Also the tea is never the same its always way too sweet are not sweet at all   I did call the manager this time because I was fed up he acted like he didnt even care I would not recommend this McDonalds
13220,2,The service is mediocre to put it light And the cleanliness of this establishment Well service blows that out of the water I hate to be so dark about this but it truly is gross
12576,2,This place needs a whole remodeling The burger was rubbery and the out side was beyond filthy My first tax paying JOB was McDonalds and I love giving positive feedback The only positive energy was the lady who handed me my food
22768,2,Your typical McDonalds but you get to eat with homeless people
20324,2,"042321 Tried them again in a rush and was insulted with a terrible attitude because I added a tea to my order then she walked away with my credit card the large cup had black finger prints marks on it and gave me a scorched and cold egg Mcmuffin sandwich The hashbrown was also greasy

I ordered a bacon McGriddle wo cheese hash brown and a senior coffee She thanked me and stated my cost When it wasnt aligned with normal cost I had to ask if I would do better ordering it as a meal That reduced the price very nicely but made me wonder why my server didnt at least offer to check the price to help me Then I decided if Im paying for my cheese Ill take it on the side When I got my order the bacon and the hash brown were just so loaded with grease The sandwich was messier sweet dough yuk and the hash brown soaked through the bag I know McDonalds serves fast food but this made me feel like a heart attack was going to happen if I ate it I rarely stop at McD but I was running and hadnt eaten The experience reminded me they are not emergency food they are emergency room food"
24696,2,Pretty cool but didnt drive a 4 hour drive to for the cashier to catch a attitude wi
17417,2,This location can never get an order correct And they always seem to make me pull up and wait

13751,2,"25

Drive thru or in person their service is slow during most times of the day

This is my second visit and I had the same experience"
16188,2,Poor 
17404,2,The drive thru is a joke always messing up my order Best to go inside or avoid this mcdonalds altogether
24402,2,Started with me having to get the attention of the Drive thru by saying hello to the order com because 2 cars had passed on my right while i was waiting Then I pulled up to receive my order I was given my drinks but was missing the one from my Happy Meal order as I asked for it and the person at the window looked at me like what was I talking about I said that i am missing a drink and again he looked at me like I was tring to get something again i mentioned that i have 3 orders with a beverage and a frap but i am still missing one then he began to say ok it is coming just pull forward to the next window as i pulled forward they brought me my items and still no drink and was still missing items again they looked at me like i did not know what i was saying and then finally got my HM drink but i was still missing items was told they are in the oven again waited 10 min with no one coming to the window to inform me of the wait I went to the window where thire was a person and again he was confused on why i was still in there line waiting on food then the manger came to the window asking what is the problem I said I am still missing my apple pies he being to tell me they are in the oven and it takes 10 min I asked am i still waiting at the other window or am i pulling to a number lane he said no next window so I pull back up and wait another 7 more min I have now been waiting 20 min for my items  If it was communicated that the wait will be a long wait I would not have felt forgotten at the window
16417,2,The drive through at this McDonalds has always been busy every time Ive gone  Its honestly worth driving a little extra to another location if you are in a hurry  Ive been stuck in the drive thru line for over 15 minutes on several occasions just ordering a single cheeseburger  Granted compared to In and Out thats nothing but this is McDonalds  That aside the interior has always been pretty clean when Ive went inside  If you go for breakfast on the weekends once again be prepared to wait  They do take Apple Pay and Android pay  The one time I used it the person behind the counter actually knew what it was  So many places tell you they dont have it but just dont know what it is  Another big plus is the drive through is 24 hours
11309,2,Currently there is no reason to mantein the restroom closed These guys are taking advantage of the initial restrictions when the COVID19 pandemic started to avoid making the bathroom easier for costumers Other McDonalds in San Diego have already opened their bathrooms to the public and like most restaurants in SD
14182,2,"Super slow Trouble getting our order right even after repeating it back twice Order was right food that came out wasnt

Once again with McDonalds if you must eat here the breakfast burritos are your best bet And Diet Coke McDonalds does Diet Coke right"
20317,2,Very slooowww service Just about any time I show They send you to the waiting spot  2 for 10 minutes for 2 chicken nuggets happy meals and 2 chicken sandwich This happens often I will go to a different McDonalds
17406,2,Didnt eat dinner so I ord
18655,2,I do not like the food
11315,2,They messed up our order on two different occasions in the drive thru I do appreciate the enthusiasm they have I also just want my order right
11841,2,typical service
13757,2,The first time we visited was at night and there was a group of male teenagers sitting outside the entrance to the building asking for money in threatening and rude manners It did not feel safe at all We did go back a couple of days later for breakfast The food was very good The omlets really hit the spot The service was good It is advertised as having over 100 arcade games upstairs There is nowhere near that many and much of them are broken down and use your credits because there are no signs on them
20320,2,Same reason as before there was a rubberband in my food rapper and dirt on my bun
18652,2,Poor 
17414,2,I dont have high expectations for McDonalds but this location is consistently disappointing Lots of mistakes on simple orders
15599,2,Great cooks here But this building is filthy  Gross And the servers are always unhappy  I have to drive out of my way to get a better experience for my money
12240,2,Food is always cold and takes forever
20339,2,My food was fresh thats why the 2 stars But customer service goes a long way And like an
20312,2,Ive been there twice My order was completely messed up both times The first time they offered to make the missing burger and make fresh fries I waited 20 min before I said I want my food or my money now I got my burger and the same fries she took from me 20 min ago I watched them screw up order after order while spending time playing and flirting Horrible place Needs real management Not management trying to get into their co workers pants
20648,2,I did not die
18235,2,This people always try to rush you on the drive through and even if you go inside store there are always problems with food last time I went over there I had 2 cold cheese burgers had to wait for my wifes food and came the wrong way If you want to eat bacon tomato and onions good luck trying to find them in burgers there are just 1 piece to none hahaha
16389,2,Ive given this location a few chances over the last two years and while the drive thru is fast the drinks taste wrong every time Something about their soda machine is just not working like other locations and hasnt been for a long time
11373,2,Its Mcdonalds so you know what you gonna get for the most part  The food here is a little below usual Mcdonalds  You never get super fresh food  The staff is typically disorganized and thee is usually people outside bumming money
13231,2,High speed good price however the quality lacked a little bit I would have wanted to wait a little longer ked order for the quality to be better even though it is a fast food restaurant
11375,2,Waiting time is way to long Had to wait for about 30 minutes for my food Thats not what i expect from this fast food chain
18612,2,Typical
11376,2,The fries were cold and hard the only bright spot was the drink
14145,2,The continents glide across the earth faster than the line moves here Food was good at least
11378,2,Its not open 24 hours anymore Closes about 2pm and reopens at 5am Place has gotten better since remodel but still has some issues like it always seems short staffed worthless bums still using drugs in the restroom and vagrants loitering outside
13768,2,This McDonalds is unique in that they have a pasta and pizza bar and an arcade upstairs Everything was priced higher than at my neighborhood McDonalds I ordered a pasta plate and had a queasy stomac
15826,2,Slow slow slow
22249,2,Wow this is just a scary place  lots of unwell homeless people  Unkept dirty place Garbage bins overflowing
14144,2,I used the app to order They dont make your food until youre actually there couldve just used the drive thru The food took over 10 mins yes 10 Then they almost forgot an item This McDonalds is consistently slow and almost always miss an item in the order but its the closest one to where I live unfortunately
15634,2,This particular day service was very slow Took eleven minutes to get my order and another customer asked for their money back
13235,2,drinks are not unlimited Chips were not good the dining table was too close to restrooms
13771,2,Food wasnt too bad for McDonalds standards Atmosphere despite a bit messy its interesting since this is the biggest

16397,2,"Every time Ive eaten there Ive never seen an employee clean or wipe down a table  Always sticky and Ive had  to use water and napkins to clean the tables before eating  Id think they would at least watch and take care of this situation   Also very drafty from AC over tables and if you want to have warm food eat fast   Ive asked if they could turn the AC down a bit but they said they couldnt
Picking another MD now"
24397,2,I would give 35 stars for the sugar free caramel iced coffee and 1 star for the sausage burritos The burritos were very small half the normal size and very little filling or cheese inside Its been a year since I had a sausage burrito and McDonalds has definitely gone downhill Prices are higher for the burrito and you get less food for the money
21191,2,Shady area but food was okay Locks on the bathrooms so you have to get an employee to open for you Understandable I guess considering the location
15617,2,Only started coming to this McDs after the one on airport pissed me off And hard to believe but this one is even worse From customer service to cleanliness and also accuracy of orde
12568,2,I work there and they drop food on the floor and still serve it to you people Half the time people dont even clean there hands often And use old grease at times or expired veggie produce  Sorry guys  They also treat workers like crap unless you kiss ass to them 
21389,2,Expensive does not share the promotions of other McDonalds nor does it offer the full menu of other McDonalds In short pay more get less as they told me thats the strip for you
12565,2,I came at 5am when they open and the doors were still locked I waited 2 minutes because I saw someone walking around then called the store and she let me in She wasnt very friendly I gave her a good morning and a smile I dont remember if I got a good morning back but definitely didnt get anything close to a smile It is opening and the place is filthy from the floor to the tables to the restroom Whoever closed the night before didnt even wipe the tables so its a bit understandable why she is irritated or whatever but lady Im not the one who left it like that so give me the smile you are paid to give me Its literally your job Plus smiling releases hormones that make you feel better Thanks

24395,2,Largest and slowest in the world Took 25 minutes from when I drove up till I left Took 15 minutes to get my food after I paid Also I did not get a good morningor anything except 739 The cost of my food Extremely bad service and attitudes from everyone I encountered there All for 2 sausage biscuits and a coffee
25540,2,I like that it is animal theme and has a playground but the cashiers are rude and they cant get your order right so they get mad when you tell them you are missing something Also they are dirty
18238,2,Food was good Everything was right but they never have any of the toys offered on the mconalds preorder app exept for what they call inisex which is really just for boys and were very short with me and rude when i asked for a proper toy for my little 2 yr old daughter She is obviously not into a avengers
11361,2,Its Mc Donalds what do you expect But it took three times to get a half cut tea And someone I was with once got a Happy meal there and they forgot to put the hamburger in So
17436,2,Over priced disgusting food
22376,2,Over run by homeless people could use a security guard  People are always taking cups out of the trash can and stealing soda from the fountains  Ocean front seating is super nice though
23930,2,Wrong orderswatch what they give youdouble order lanes mean double mistakes
21385,2,Needs cleaned inside and out
12574,2,I went to get four spicy mcChicken with a happy meal and two mcRibs combo I bought three drinks and they forgot to give me my happy meal and forgot the straws for my drinks The bread for the mcChickens were Nasty I understand is very busy but please pay more attention to the food and the service We pay to eat fresh food not nasty breads My friends and I went to the beach to have our meals and We couldnt enjoy our drinks because no straws PLEASE PUT MORE ATTENTION
13745,2,Today we had the opportunity to go to such a wellknown McDonalds the truth is that the place is very nice but in terms of the attention and organization it was terrible half of my order was missing and although I went to tell them that it was wrong they did not pay attention to me So many employees so they cant help me in my order My children were very excited to go to the play place but their air conditioning did not work and it was unbearably hot They should pay a little attention to those flaws Thank you
14185,2,Good like any other McDonalds in the world but this location like Chicfil a here in Abilene  need to do something with the traffic jams they cause Franchise owner need to stop by and use the drive thru and feel the Pain
20308,2,Missing 1 large French Fries Wrong honey mustard instead of sweet and sour had to pay 10 cents per sauce packet Very slow service The slow service might be that more time is put into closing the bag with tape than it takes to prepare the food The only reason they get any stars is because they were super polite
21429,2,No drive thru have to oder using a board not a person Ugh
24962,2,New look is Dark Unfriendly and less seating  finding a new Bright family friendly MCDONALDS
15573,2,This McDonalds is like almost all others they not that good like most parents just went there because the kids wanted to play The play place is outdated its outside dirty and hot The food is like all McDonalds not that good but they do have two ipads on two tables with games 
18221,2,The food is fine Service at the drive through is horrendous Unprofessional and unhelpful  Its good that ther
13187,2,"Massive homelessness dirty outside
No parking NO drive thru security more worried about masks then the drugs dealing at the door"
14215,2,This is hands down the slowest McDonalds I have ever been to  Im not talking one or two times they e been slow  every single time I come here  Glaciers move faster than this service
15861,2,They aren
21424,2,Terrible Shells in egg mcmuffins BOTH McMuffins And large soda was only 24 oz and had a nasty taste
13732,2,This McDonalds has everything cake pasta pizza and a fish tank and even a specialty breakfast We ordered waffles and French toast and ham and cheese sandwich You grab a because this place is super busy and sit down You can sit and watch the food being made We saw the food come out and sit and no one grab it employees and managers walk by Irene went up to a manager and asked how much longer and they said a few more minutes and no one still grabbed it Finally after 35 minutes one of the same managers who had walked by it several times picked up the meals and tried to serve them to us We told them that we had watched everything 
21183,2,12 minutes to get 3 cars out of the drive thru line When all the cars needed to be told was please pull around to expedite speed of service I left without eating because of time
15575,2,Park is very worn down with minimal area for kids Bathrooms are messy and unkempt However the food is still good and as expected just that it can be extremely dirty at points
11265,2,This place is a total wreck most of the time This is an extremely busy location and Ive been going here for years as a customer and also as a delivery driver and its astonishing that pandemic or not they still have the same issues They are never prepared to maintain the volume of business You often have to repeat yourself multiple times when communicating with the staff If you go at night particularly latenight theres likely to be a long line in drivethru or inside They regularly claim their system is down and so are unable to accommodate you Its completely upsurd I dont understand how any establishment can think that this mode of operation is acceptable Other than that typical McDonalds
15576,2,The workers were too busy standing and talking instead of coming to pick up the receipts from  the customers to pay for their meal It was jus not right Had to wait almost an hour for the food It was very poor
11268,2,Customer service is horrible Food is disgusting and I love McDonalds but this one aint it
21422,2,Very slow service I worked for McDonald before and we were trained to acknowledge the ptron by letting them know youre there and be with them shortly
20282,2,"I went in and ordered at a kiosk to go  I got a medium caramel frappe and a mcextreme bacon sandwich
While waiting in line  I heard the kitchen staff say there is no sauce for the extreme should we give it to them anyway With no intentions of me hearing 
When my order came out no one informed us there was no sauce  didnt ask us when making it if we still wanted it  another sandwich or my money back 
I told them I heard them and they denied it  then said that they told someone else to let me know there was missing items for the sandwich  But she didnt  I could hear them and why would she make it without confirmation if she DID tell someone to ask 
I also noticed there was 2 tomatoes instead of 3 that i paid extra for same goes for the pickles I asked extra for 
I got a male employees attention and told him  hey this isnt correctetc he hot an attitude  rolled his eyes turned his back on me to continue what he was doing previously 
The only saving grace was a lady named Elyce  someone who I thought was a manager but she is only a crew member
She intervened corrected my order  The only one who helped  She deserves a raise a reward  Thank you 

Ps the lobby is dirty  Take some time to clean the tables"
20655,2,Will avoid this location
13390,2,This place doesnt offer any of McDonalds nationwide deals Also no refills on any drinks
11261,2,Good place and good location But staff needs training Some workers are very very slow and you can tell that they are not familiar with the menu and point of sale machines It took them 15 minutes to make my caramel macchiato Hopefully it will improve over time
15570,2,Service is slow sometimes they run out of drinks or cant make frappes
22390,2,No matter what time of day you wwil see maybe 5 people working in whole store Usually  one or less gone for 5 minutes cashier working the front Orders take excessive amount of time fullfill Thats if you even get what you ordered This is the slowest Macdonalds I have ever been to in my life
20274,2,"Not too customer friendly a definite language barrier
Ordered  1035 right when the lunch menu starts and the fries were mildly warm definitely not fresh"
11885,2,Poor 
22651,2,It doesnt have bathrooms for customers only provides disposable wet towels
21179,2,Always an issue with the app here Entrance from the street is very dangerous for those of us that come from the back around the building from the side street then you cross in front of driveway to parking lot for other businesses on the way to drive thru This time as Im trying to pullup to the entrance of drive thru by the speaker a white truck came in and didn
20266,2,Food was alright staff seemed too busy with their own pastimes rather then getting food and drinks out Saw one employee sweep four times in the same spot while three customers were waiting on drinks Id only recommend if its your last option
16468,2,Its a McDonalds so the food is very consistent Unfortunately the parking lot is impossible to use since the drive through wraps through it Ive been stuck in the parking lot for 20 minutes with no way to get out
24677,2,It has been 20 min and im still sitting here as I am writing this waiting for my food And the employees seem too busy to acknowledge your presence half the time when you are trying to speak to them
24422,2,Ordered curbside The attendant came out to tell me that my apple pie would take 15 minutes and he couldnt cancel it He said he can substitute for cookies 15 minutes later I had my order with cookies and still no apple pie Frustrating Their soft drinks are always hit or miss as well because the balance of syrup and water is never correct
17355,2,The food was okay The staff was very friendly But after I ordered at the counter I turned around to see a roach or beetle thing Then when I sat down to eat in the restaurant that had no air I saw a huge spider in the window and copious amounts of crumbs and food being carried around by ants
22393,2,The food was good but the old lady taking orders was just straight up disrespectful I dont know who hurt her but its like she takes her anger on customers Very impatient
17356,2,The drive through line was extremely slow and they had the second lane lit up but didnt  wait on anyone I sat there waiting then finally gave up because when I went to go in the other lane I had to go ba k around the building and by the time I got there there were 4 more cars ahead of me now
21181,2,Waited 20 minutes in the drive thru and never made it to put my order in so I got the cars behind me to let me out of line
23962,2,Its okthe service stinks took too long
16460,2,Cold nuggets  Homeless people just walking around cars
11251,2,"Ive been here many times usually after midnight as I work late Recently the majority of the times Ive gone through the drive through they say that theyre closed but when I ask what their hours are they say oh were just closed for an hour this has happened to me at 2am last night 4am last week etc

My issue is with the restaurant claiming to be open 24h even though it definitely isnt"
16459,2,It takes forever to get breakfast here every time inside and out
21433,2,The customer service is good but cant say the same for the food also got some defective lids
11870,2,Poor 
25572,2,Always great to go there but they need to work on giving food or right to there customers several cases of not handing me the right stuff
17705,2,Its Mcdonalds
16441,2,ts fast food they take like 2030 for an order and all the tables are dirty
11276,2,I mean its McDonalds right You know what to expect from the food which is both a plus and a minus However at this particular McDonalds right on Garnet in Pacific Beach they are undergoing Construction It seems like a complete redo the outside and some of the guest areas as well Its a mess and noisy but does not look like any RI modeling of the kitchen area is being done That makes me wonder why this has become the worst drivethrough around even before the construction Two cars in front of me still waited almost 10 minutes Isnt that a lot from McDonalds Or foremost drivethrus these days it seems to be way too much time Now Im not just saying this because of todays visit this is been the case at this McDonalds now for the past couple of months Maybe its shorthanded help but that would only be an excuse for once in awhile Anyway not a great experience but probably should be eating elsewhere anyway
12229,2,Prefer Burger King so Im biased
14205,2,When you go to McDonalds you are expecting fast and consistent food Not the case here My order came out 16 minutes after I ordered and the sandwich was on the wrong bread
22388,2,"Food was average
Understaffed
Too noisy"
14190,2,Fries not fresh and sandwich was weirdly falling apart Consistently not a great experience at this drive thru
11295,2,It is a very clean and recently revamped McDonalds but beware taking your kids here as outside is well a cockroach infested wonderland full of PBs finest citizens Thats all this Review gets Use the drive through you wouldnt want to catch HepC on your way to wash your hands
20299,2,For Gods sakes please make the cookies fresh and warm when a customer orders them  stop baking 2 dozen ahead of time a
12232,2,This facility is always dirty no matter what time of the day or day of the week
15849,2,This place just recently had a arm robbery event so i will not be going back
12233,2,Never get an order right Like ever
17390,2,Bought 4 fish filet sandwiches they were old cold and burned at the end of the sandwich it was horrible they should be a shame selling reheated microwave sandwiches
13743,2,"Dont waste your time or money We were excited to visit here with out of town guests straight from the airport
1 Kiosks are backed up with a bunch of people each so no where to stand wait or snake through with trays of food Kiosks were glitchy and blanked out every minute
2 It is at least 10 degrees warmer upstairs so NOT comfortable at all
3 Even with our order number on the table no one ever brought foodafter 20 minutes i went down stairs and it was sitting there Then there is no drink station upstairs so with an already full tray i had to bring food up and then come down for drinks So why did i have to pick a flavor if the only deliver an empty
4 No one to help with service or questions Lady upstairs spoke no English I had to raise my hand at the counter after standing there 5 minutes to find my food just to get acknowledged
5 After all that found one sandwich missing Went back again and notified i was missing the cheese steak and staff member walked to the other pasta section where it was sitting by itself
6 Cheeseburgers were not made to order as requested on the kiosk
7 Big mac was dry Worst one ever

We wont be back"
11298,2,Workers very nice but when we ordered at window as we drove off it was changed from Big Macs to quarter pounders  I said something when I paid and he corrected it got to window and he handed me the bag they were quarter pounders  Just took a long time and everything was wrong
18673,2,Poor 
18229,2,I hate it when I point out a problem and the management tell me that thats the way its supposed to be  I managed a McDonalds for many years  I know better I still order their food regularly all over the country  I know better The new manager has made things much better but standards still slip back to the old ways when hes not here
22232,2,Its been awhile since I last  eat at McDonalds  and so I thought Id  go in and have a Big Mac when I ordered  she repeated  one Big Mac 40 minutes  later they called  my number  it wasnt  a Big  Mac  it was a crispy chicken so the manager came and recognized the  problem  then went  away the cashier told me  if I want my money back I would have to  get back in that first line So now Im  kinda  hot  then about  3 minutes  later the manager was waving a bag from the  counter at me  so I walk up  and she said  heres your Big Mac sir let me tell you  that was the tastiest  Big Mac Ive had in  years
22233,2,"Seems like they always makes some mistakes when they get busy

Rough way to complete there sandwiches

Sauce was spilled out from box and made lots of mess

Forgot to put bbq sauce for nuggets"
16187,2,Poor 
18672,2,Poor 
14186,2,Food not always fresh Found a hair in my cheseburger and hardly ever any fresh sweet tea and staff not real friendly Just this location Ive been to other McDonalds and no problems
25246,2,Poor 
20307,2,Food getting blandservice good atmosphere a bit outdated
24408,2,"Service is slow and painful lost McDouble Bundle option on menu for budget minded customers Still giving it 2 stars because employees arent paid enough to say Have a Good Day when you getting order at pick up window

Change my mind next time I drive through and youll get more stars

Like what you see Just say OYE

The Blond One"
14332,2,"Its McDonalds The nuggets were kinda old of course the ice cream machine
was still broke Tea was kinda nasty"
22670,2,Just tried to order and debit card machine not working  Second time its happened here in two weeks  Really Poor management
23616,2,Bad service that dont give me what you order
16438,2,Happy it
22227,2,Very bad service The attitude of a female staff is terrible If you don
11865,2,Poor 
16434,2,bad night went for a burger got trapped in the drive thru took almost ten min to get to the order screen only to find out their grill was down and they arent cooking meat just nuggets trapped for another ten minutes for a total of almost twenty minutes with nothing to show for it things happen just put a damn sign up
16433,2,My brother and I tolerate it because its close to us and its open when no one else is  But  you get the loonies showing up there Homeless wandering in and out filling up for free their gutter cups at the soda machine Smells psych ward cryouts and who knows what else are the norm so do yourself a favor and order by the drive through and get the hell out quick
11278,2,I went for an ice cream cone and its always sketchy A lot of times they dont have ice cream This time they were cleaning the machine in the middle of the day Thats just stupid No ice cream cones or milkshakes or any other ice cream products McDonalds is known for this though Not just this one I dont eat their food because most of it sucks
17378,2,The staff on the drive thru dont have patience
17381,2,As usual they dont listen to you when you make your order they just give you what they feel like at the time and they want 15 per hr JOKE Maybe they robots will get it right
13192,2,Rude cashier Dirty seats and tables And full of very crazy looking peopledrugs i felt a little bit uncomfortable The Hot chocolate didnt taste like HC at all
11283,2,Didnt take very long to get food but the person taking my order didnt speak a single word of English so she had to ask for help for everything I said She was being trained at the same time but couldnt even talk to me I understand Spanish is needed sometimes especially in Southern California but when its busy and youre the only one working the register and the main language is English what are you going to do Whats really going to happen is youre going to restrict what your customers are able to order I order the same thing every time I decide to come to McDonalds so I have no complaints about the food but this time it compelled me to write a review Was an uncomfortable situation today
23612,2,Cold fries Double cheeseburgers were not hot and the cheese wasnt melted  The mms were dumped on the top of the mcflurry and some spilt out  18 is expensive for my meal and a happy meal for my daughter Then subpar at best
12619,2,Slow service bad area after hours not very safe to eat in recommend drive through the food is consistent for the most part the staff is ok but can be better getting in and out can be cumbersome not the best place for a date or families Its ideal for a quick stop and go only
21187,2,The food was hot and fresh but i could not wash my hands The manager and crew was like the bathroom dirty so you cant use it yet no one went to clean it They offered some sanitizer wipes but you cant sanitize nothing thats not cleanHad to eat my food with a paper towel
11285,2,"As always the service is slow  its a busy spot i get it Today the  s were way past mine now i have to stand in line because i was told just a minute several times to find out about my ordernow i just want my money back not hungry anymore The Sup Did fix the problem though i dont know what was said  i still only speak our official language 36 minutes later out the door with an  i appolagize

update Avoid this place Didnt think it possible it could get slower dirtier or more Dangerous WOW
My Bad      "
14198,2,2 stars instead of 1 only because it could always be worse fries just warm Double quarter pounder with cheese just warm tending towards cold and the meat looked really dark like I would expect a black bean burger to look like  disgusting The mayonnaise tasted slighty weird too I thought it might be miracle whip for a second Shares a fairly nasty restroom in the hallway between McDonalds and Exxon Over 8 for this junk is terrible
13737,2,I think I had much higher expectations of this McDonalds because I was strongly suggested to visit  I expected a 30 foot statue of Ronald McDonald and it ended up being a lackluster 30 foot lighted outline of Ronald on the building  The picture online of the building made it look like it was made of a French Fry building structure  It wasnt  They had a separate drink station where you gave them your drink order an extra step because no self service ones anywhere  They had a separate dessert station and a walk up food counter to order or selfserve kiosks to order from where they will serve if you eat in but not the soft drinks  It is 2 stories  The 2nd floor is a play area which I expected would be huge it isnt and a small arcade areavery small  The menu showed some items different from other McDonalds but 95 of them showed OUT OF STOCK So we just ate the kind of food you could eat at a regular McDonalds only it cost MUCH more Allinallvery unexciting and not what it should be for being the WORLDS LARGEST MCDONALDS 
13388,2,2 stars because I had to dodge beggars and also because I got charged for a refill that must be a California thing but its uncalled for
11287,2,Even though they renovated this place a few months ago the homeless still call this place home I cant ever sit inside without hearing screaming or seeing someone passed out on the floor outside And the last few times i had to inquire about my order because they forgot about it If anything go through drive thru
11289,2,Staff were arguing amongst themselves whether who does what Managers were indifferent to employees and with customers Ordered two Happy Meals and a McFlurry and about 6 customers after I ordered received their orders before me We waited around 20 minutes or more The McFlurry was supposed to be the Stroopwafel and there was hardly any in it it was 99 vanilla ice cream
13740,2,"A different McDonalds experience worth trying We had a good time trying different menu items not found at any other McDonalds Definitely worth a visit if youre coming to Orlando

Update Not the same as it used to be The selections are limited and not as international as it once was It lost its uniqueness and it feels like its just a regular busy McDonalds now Not recommended anymore"
25035,2,Give me the wrong food
26299,2,Full of homeless people not like Im unaware of our global situation with homelessness but if you looking to sit down chill and eat dont do it at this one It doesnt have a drive thru so order ahead for pick up it does have self service ordering kiosk
2429,2,Bad attitude very rude to customer
27772,2,No one to take your order its all done on kiosks had to have my ice coffee remade because they couldnt get it right the first time
2470,2,Always getting my order wrong
31637,2,Service is slow and not very friendly First and last visit
27791,2,A clean place with a good airco food is another story Bread of the burgers is dried out french fries were cold No do not go here if you want good food
27801,2,Person was very rude gave me the wrong order and the food was cold check the food back and got my money back
7450,2,Cold food slow service
31639,2,Not in the best neighborhood but its been standing for years now so they got to be doing something right
27811,2,Asked for a large water when they brought my order to my table  And she never came back
2504,2,Sometimes they serve old food here
27816,2,I GIVE IT 2 STARS because they were quickBut on the other handThe fries were coldand the burgers were drenched with ketchup Told the gentleman to hold one moment and 5 seconds later a girl came on Like give us a minute I normally dont write a review and I hate to leave a bad oneBut you would think because its in front of oldtown its hot and fresh Just got out of the hospital wanted a warm meal
7432,2,Exactly what you expect and nothing else
31601,2,Very hot in the play area and it also smells like its never cleaned
27830,2,Food was hot and order came as it was ordered However they had no pop It was okay would i go back sure
31600,2,Did not make my coffee right Tasted like water
31608,2,"THE FOOD WAS OK
THE CUSTOMER SEVICE WAS EXTREMELY OFF POINT RUDE CASHIER N MANAGER"
2463,2,Ok packed usually get the order wrong
2457,2,Dont eat fast food Once in a blue moon the breakfast
31646,2,Slow They also gave me old fries and the meat on the burger looked hours old
27714,2,There are better McDonald locations then here Usually 9 out of 10 times they forget something you ordered
27721,2,Seems like they always makes some mistakes when they get busy
7535,2,Good
2428,2,I am a person that is going to close restuants i am going to be there in 15 minutes sharp
7531,2,They are trying
31669,2,Staff super rude nothing comes out correctly or good
27731,2,A disappointing visit We ordered using the kiosk since no one was manning the counter cash register We waited over 20 minutes for 3 standard combo meals and no one else was inside the restaurant The people working in the back only worked on drive thru orders While waiting we watched as they cleared our order off the monitor without having served it At that point I asked one of the employees why our order was cleared and he responded that he didnt realize it hadnt been served We were the only people in the restaurant and we were clearly waiting at the counter for something whether it was food or a condament or napkins and they never even bothered to ask what we needed or what we were waiting for The staff completely ignored us until we asked why our order was cleared without getting anything They did make our order fresh once we asked for it which is why I gave more that 1 star for the food We would not return to this location
27733,2,Not only was it packed and slow moving but our mobile app that said ready in 35 minutes actually tool close to 15 minutes A BIG thing was having to pay to have a refill on your drink That is ridiculous
27750,2,Complicated kiosk ordering salty fries can order lightly salted decent but too much sodium in the hamburgers  Good for in a pinch or for a quick bite
2438,2,Remodeled location with extremely unpleasant staff
31661,2,Sure would have been nice if FF were HOT
2450,2,They always give me the wrong salad
7498,2,Its ok
7496,2,Too many mistakes here
7494,2,Ok long wait
27843,2,I dont
27849,2,They forgot my ice cream but I went back and got it The line is very long weekends so go during the week The curbside pickup is excellent I am appending my review this is the second time I ordered and they forgot an item This McDonalds is beyond busy 
27852,2,Every time I came during my two week visit I was asked to pull forward into the parking spots where the mobile ordering area is there was always 24  cars pulled up waiting for food just so they can make their drive thru times better No one wants to pull forward for you to make your ratings look better Get it together 
31591,2,Their ordering speakers both dont work waited like 20 min
7340,2,Disappointing service Took forever to get a simple meal
27891,2,"Our order was incorrect We ordered a Big Mac meal  with a large coke and a medium caramel frappe We were handed a medium coke with the meal and frappe When we said the coke was supposed to be large the worker Manager asked for the receipt which shows
1 Big Mac MlLrg
1 M Coke
Then she said You have to ask for a large We did She didnt offer to correct their error
When do you ever order a large meal with a medium drink The fry was a large but they were cold The Big Mac was dry I forgot why we dont usually go to McDonalds Thank you for reminding me"
7336,2,Slow service Wrong order
27897,2,Horrible Got home ordered a crispy chicken sandwich They gave it to me on a plain dry bun with nothing on it Just chicken  bread
7329,2,Card machine was out of service Needed to pay cash and slow
27900,2,We stopped in for a midday snack since we were across the street at Fun Spot of America  I placed a mobile order the cashier didnt know that after standing there for 5 minutes he finally said mobile order 1634 I raised my hand and he slide me the bag Never
7319,2,Milkshake never works main reason I go there shamrock shakes never have it
27905,2,Says 24 hour drive through Theyre always closed shut down doing maintenance only cash systems are down or some other reasons why they cant serve the early risers They shouldnt post on the signa that the drive through is open just to not serve anyone or have it on maps that they are open just to refuse customers
2598,2,Went down hill for me
7313,2,That  place is expensive 300 for large iced coffee  Id rather go to 711 store
7310,2,They get the drive thru wrong Moody of the time
7308,2,"Drive thru order almost

31516,2,Rudeand they gave me the wrong order
7299,2,Cheap food but burgers taste so genero
7288,2,"Terrible

Avoid this McDonalds Terrible service incorrect bill charges Just a bad experience"
7346,2,Under construction best to avoid until it is finished
2413,2,Most of the tables arent cleaned
27885,2,Fries were good and hot I also got the crispy chicken  sandwich It was hot but  seemed like they forgot to season it as it was very bland and basically had no taste at all The only thing I tasted was the two pickles on the sandwich I definitely will not get this sandwich again here I have to say overall ordering the crispy chicken sandwich at any McDonalds is a major gamble I have gotten it once or twice before when it was really good but more often than not it has not been good at all Bland burnt dry etc  take my advice dont get the c
27879,2,Order was wrong despite using ordering terminal and salad had large section that was inedible see the picture Looked like the lettuce had been out of date for a month Took forever as well
31590,2,McChicken always calm my hungry momentums
31589,2,Hispanic young skinny girl Shes at the cash register and her attitude stinks 
31584,2,Leaving the zoo with my kids stopped to grab a bite to eat but my kids said the restrooms were dirty We left
27862,2,Insanely busy line around the building for the drive through out the door for walk in and order ridiculously busy customer service was friendly but order was wrong and took a long time to complete maybe they just need more employees on a Sunday morning my family is 
2540,2,Too crowded slow service

27871,2,"Used a deal at the kiosk for a free kids meal w combo purchase and when I went to check out it said Deal is unavailable  wiped out the order forcing me to reenter everything and the deal code was now invalid I get that they are for participating locations but if youre not a participating location put up a sign or something so I dont waste my time
The drink fountain was closed to keep the restaurant clean according to the sign so I went to the counter and asked for a refill and the manager said We dont do refills here What Seriously Unlike every other McDonalds Youre gonna give me the saltiest fries ever and then make me pay for a refill Again if that is this locations policy fine But post a sign so that the expectation is set"
7370,2,The service is so decent and speedy
2551,2,Poor response from delivery counter
27873,2,"One of my favorite features of McDonalds for me is that I know what I can expect offerings flavors etc
This is true for this particular restaurant however it seems that being soooo busy I guess excellent location makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their customers

Running out of lettuce running out of many things are managementlogistics problems Bad attitude lack of courtesy well I guess that problem is on us the customers right

The two stars are for do providing the best breakfast sandwich in the market still regardless of attitude and bad manners"
31563,2,They must have been busy before we got there cause the store looked nasty
7362,2,No lids or peanuts or whip cream for the Sundaes 
7361,2,Long wait time for online orders
31558,2,Too slowneed to be more welcoming and get orders right 
7285,2,Awful place Really Bad service and everything is dirty and stinks
7558,2,Fastfood
2400,2,Food tasted bad and there was a fight inside the place
2298,2,Still not allowing customers to eat inside
7793,2,They got mostly all the orders wrong and also had a few customers including myself waiting more than 10 minutes
2301,2,The managers have an attitude for no reason  Havent been there for long time
27545,2,"The worst Attitudes Cold friestwice The clerk gave the cleaning guy my order in the middle of him sweeping the floor to bring to my car Unsanitary
2nd timethe order was still wrong
Food wasnt good at all Wont be going back"
27546,2,Incorrect hours  I arrived at 552 in the morning and was informed that they still closed
2308,2,2 times they gave me the wrong order How hard is it
7794,2,When this restaurant switched from Corporate to Franchise a few years ago I was really happy with the changes that were made the owner was seen there frequently the employees seemed happy to be working there and everything was running smoothly Now in 2022 the lines are terrible when taking your order they give you the total without asking if more items were needed seldomly the employees smile at you and you see that the employees are bothered by the customers I stopped visiting as often as I did because the service went downhill Today I visited only because a friend wanted some food for her son Unless serious changes are made I dont plan to visit again
7775,2,Went to order drivethru and not sure if it was the person was training or technical difficulties but the person who was taking the order could not understand or hear us After repeating ourselves several times Im guessing a manager took over but she had the NASTIEST attitude over the speakerphone I was clear on my order but Im guessing the workplace mustve been stressful for her to had taken my order the way she did Its McDonald
2309,2,"There are people sleeping at the tables
There are people fighting and cursing in the restaurant Its not a place to enjoy"
27558,2,I went through one of the drive thru lanes last night and waited for about 15 minutes as they only took orders from the other lane I was not able to back up my car so I went forward to ask what was up When I got to the only window open they said they were only taking orders from one side I suggested they put up a sign and asked if could take my order at the window they said I would have to go through the drive thru again I am not going here anymore for this in addition to the times they got my order wrong
2311,2,Boring fast food jointnot the same any more
2314,2,The manager is always stressed and doesnt know how to behave
31772,2,Not clean and food was cold
27576,2,One of the worst with service I ordered a ice latte through the app for pickup So I go inside I wait at pickup Drink isnt ready and other people are waiting also I mentioned to the solo employee I had a pickup order She says ok then goes off to make other peoples meals So I try to be patient stood there for like 20min and never received my drink They never canceled my drink I left and was still charged for it Also they never sent the 1 cashier who was struggling by herself no help
7765,2,Lack of customer service I wish McDonalds will invest in improving their hospitality more than  spending alot of money in advertising 
7800,2,"This McDonalds has quickly gone downhill over the last year Service is slow on Friday evening or night plan to spend 20 to 30 mins in the drivethru and you better check your order before you leave Multiple times items have been missing from my order and just last week I only got 10 of my 20 pieces for the 20 piece nugget I ordered

If this is what we can look forward to as minimum wage continues to climb I wont be getting this for my kids much in the future and will just make chicken nuggets and fries at home"
7814,2,Mosr of the food was delivered after we were sent to the parking lot since it was 2 big breakfasts and a mcgriddle with 3 drinks Food was delivered within a few minutes but after waiting 10 minutes we had to go back into the drive through Because they forgot our drinks After we went back they gave it and when we went home they forgot to give us straws and the extra hashbrown we ordered Food good but lacking service Very nice cashier lady but the food handler wasnt as nice
7817,2,I usually DONT have a problem with McDonalds but tonight was different  I was ordering something for my granddaughter  then I wanted something for myself  I was looking at the menu and the person who was taking my order was very impatient with me  acting as if I was preventing her from going sometwhere  I said can you give me a minute please  she replied under her breath thats all you had to say in the first place  then when I went around to pay she disappeared and had someone else accept my payment  Then I was handed  my food  with stares and nothing Said by the staff Needless to say  I threw away the food Not about to play games with these little high school kids  A company who cares about their reputation should try to train and manage their workers before hiring them  Horrible service tonight
31818,2,They are not all was kind to the customersr
31815,2,Cheap food tastes fake
27513,2,How do you miss a patty on a big mac  First time going there too
7874,2,Good was good but took 7 minutes to get me an iced coffee
27517,2,Rude on the drive thru speaker and at the window the only postive was the person who  gave me my food She was very kind and polite to me
7872,2,They were very slow I literally waited 10 minutes on the drive thru It was about 10 oclock at night I will not go to this one again  Food was good but speed of service was horrible 
27519,2,Sat in the drive thru for about 15 to 20 min because they were very busy and still got very cold food Took the fries back Very disappointed
31797,2,Zoo McDonalds need more help after midnight
2286,2,The service is bad The cashier is no prepare dollar bill for change Let customers wait a time So poor service
7849,2,The McDouble is terrible Very dry and very little ketchup and mustard on it Couldnt finish my first one Bread should taste soft and fresh Meat should be juicy And they through it together which makes a mess And hardly any onions on it Fries should be soft not hard and with plenty of salt on them ALL burgers should be juicy Thats what makes a great burger
31795,2,They never put sugar on the coffee
31788,2,Bad food but OK service
31787,2,Food the same service to slow
7822,2,They used to be great but now the new managers are not trying to make customers happy I asked for fries during breakfast and was told no the new store manager said they cant comply I even told them I would wait The other staff here are great and friendly Sorry that your new managers are not following the corporate way
7819,2,Uusually I like McDonalds but not today  Ordered a crispy chicken deluxe meal Everything was cold especially the fries  The one thing they usually dont mess up  YUK
27580,2,"Fries soggy most of the time
Soda gets bad constantly Gave me seltzer water instead of soda
Sandwiches not bad except that theyre dry sometimes
Customer service anything else After every single request instead of would you care to try our new "
2326,2,I used uber driver got lost and my food was cold and now prepared to my request
2329,2,forget give me ice cream every time
7707,2,Poor 
27642,2,Too much waiting seems like the staffs dont know how a fast food restaurant suppose to be run On top of the wait they forget items that you pay for so make sure to ask for a receipt if something not right with this McDonalds please report it call and complain
31734,2,Not so good food always cold
31732,2,Fries are a hit and miss at this place
27648,2,Not Satisfied after buying 3 Large orders of fries for 1197 and was given large containers SERIOUSLY HALF FULL looking like Small or Medium sized fries Very disappointed
7632,2,What do you think my hamburger went against the receipt of the order what do you think
27653,2,Its my local McDonalds so I wish I could rate it higher especially considering they added modern stuff like the DIY menu boards and the 2nd drive thru lane But whats the point of a second drive thru lane if your employees just ignore it like what happened tonight Also while they have security inside the pan handlers in the drive thru lanes at night are out of control Food wise things take a long time usually but its your normal McDonalds type food except they dont salt their fries well
27657,2,"This McDonalds has always been bottomofthebarrel as far back as I can remember and a sleek facelift doesnt change the fact that a visit to this McDonalds will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth The list of their offenses is too long to detail every one so Ill compile a list
1 Incorrect orders 50 of the time
2 Rude employees and managers
3 Customers who are loud offensive and downright violent
4 Poorly made slappedtogether food

And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting company PBS Parking Boot Service and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand 200 cash in exchange for the boot removal It seems this McDonalds is doing everything to lose business They thrive off of convenient location alone Absolutely terrible experience"
31725,2,Construction everywhere makes this place a mess to visit
27663,2,Every time I go I dont get what I ask  and the some employee are mean
31713,2,Aways have bad experience wit food there
27679,2,More expensive long and I mean longgggggggghg wait times inside or out Oh and you
2384,2,Terrible considering that they dont have control of those school kids who are so rowdy
31700,2,Gave me the wrong drink after 3 request
27687,2,I went in to use the bathroon before i go buy some thing and i saw i had to be  Buzz Inn so I went to the front to have me  to be buzzed in and I was told no I had to buy something first and the funny thing is Im a diabetic and my sugar was high and I was in pain but I had to buy something first just to be let into the bathroom then when I was let into the bathroom it was so disgusting Know one clean the bathroom the toilet was filled with toilet paper and piss all over the rim of the toilet dry on u can see it and the manager that Im assuming she had like a Jamaican accent and gave me kind of a nasty attitude also i wouldnt  recommend it  to come here and i was  visiting from upstate New York it was a long drive
2398,2,Their credit card machine is always down most of the nights I come
27635,2,Really bad service Food was cold And large fries wasnt even full Probably size of a medium Have to do better
31691,2,Food was okay cashier was rude and they dont have outlets
27634,2,Its absurd how bad the service is here I wouldnt recommend going through the drive through Theyll mess up your order and then make you wait a long time for it again Id say just ignore this McDonalds entirely but if you do come to this location do yourself a favor Park the car and order your meal inside the fast food restaurant Itll be faster this way
27631,2,Service and the food here REALLY suck Ive been there a few times after work which is after midnight and always end up kicking myself in the ankle for doing so my order is NEVER complete NEVER chicken nuggetsno sauce saladno dressing Ill pay for some cookies or apple pies and nothing not in the bag and to add insult to injury the food that does make it into the bag seems like its been sitting around for hoursway to save a buck mickey dees skip this place if you can trust me
31757,2,Only drove by Didnt stop for services
7702,2,Poor 
27593,2,"No to all of that
Always a long line The kids working the drive thru are always in a bad mood Orders get mixed up and the fries toddle between not being fresh to being freshly made in old oil I will stop there"
27598,2,Couldnt get a simple order correct so had to wait Asked specifically for something still forgot it and had to go in and ask again And food was subpar McDonalds standards so that saying something it was at least cleaner than most also at this point saying something
7692,2,Poor 
27600,2,The apple pies here were the worst It was like biting into a regular apple The only thing cooked was the outside The inside was cold and the apples were hard I went there 122618 to get happy meals for my daughters and their fries were too hard to eat I wont be going back there I only went to reward the girls for cleaning their room and helping around the house for 2 weeks This was their choice of reward for good behavior
27602,2,"With as much staff as was on hand there is no reason I should have waited longer than 30 minutes but I did
I was not happy with my order when I got it
Nor was my body satisfied when it went down
If you want to try this place knock yourself out"
2344,2,My order was wrong bathroom was dirty tables want clean
27612,2,Sorry what i have to saidbut this place always is a mess Everytime you going to this restaurant have to wait a lot for your foodjust because the employes always been around they place of work talk like they are on the streetin ocasion i hear said bad word when the costumer been inside the storehonestly they need better cordination at the time of work
7675,2,Poor 
2349,2,Dont purchas the nuggets after 11pm cold hard and overall just not good
7671,2,Devil
27617,2,Order was wrong Paid for 2 double hamburgers received 2 single hamburgers Drivethru took forever despite being empty
27623,2,The service is slow Order anything more complex than a cheeseburger and you are sent to the side to wait for your order On top of that your order is often wrong so always check
7657,2,Poor 
27632,2,The workers there are not professionali went in there to get my morning coffee and heard one of the girls using profanity and customes can over hear them then the cashier told me to give her a second and she went to the drive through window and start taking customers at the window while there was already someone there handling the drive through customers i stood at the cash register close to 20mins to place my order then on another occasion i placed my order on the mobile app the young lady made my ice coffee and left it by the machine  another team member asked what i was waiting for i then told her my ice coffee the girl that made it told her im waiting on my ice coffee too 30mins later im still standing there without my coffee then the girl turned around and saw me standing there still then saw the coffee sitting there and eventually handed it to me and note i was the only customer left in the McDonalds other customers came in placed their order got their stuff and left a long time ago im suggesting more training for these individuals working at this location I have observed this for a while now and said nothing I turn my head everytime i pass there now if youre running late for work i suggest walking through the drive through youll get your order more faster than going in
27930,2,Went at night at the request of my son since we had a very long day of driving Bad move on our part Ordered a filet It was totally hard Not just the bread The fish was a hockey puck Very nasty Had to throw it out The fries were the back upthank goodness for those at least  We also waited too long on line but his nuggets and fries were okay
27931,2,This is the only McDonalds I know that decid
7279,2,Drive thru is closed   There
6927,2,Not as clean or well organized as most McDonalds
28090,2,The price is good using the McDonalds app with the dollar coke what is the point of giving free French fries when they are cold They were absolutely been trashed Customer service was good this time
2870,2,Poor 
28097,2,Ordered mcdouble bundle no ketchup light onions and extra mustard I got cheese and pickles The fries were terrible and my drink was fine
28099,2,The never has the coke icee
31271,2,The service could be better they always forget to give you condiments and napkins Even after youve ask Then soon as you drive away  You have to come back and go inside and explain that you were lied to
2862,2,Poor 
6898,2,McChickens were expensive for some reason I dont like it
6893,2,Not a fan of McDonalds  This one was not real clean
2880,2,Poor 
6880,2,Old chiken nd so many baggers inside the Macdonald
31256,2,Same ol ready in 2 minutes food Idk how they do it  But ramen needs to step up their game because it takes longer to cook noodles in the microwave  Great Job Mickey Ds
28123,2,Slowest most under staffed McDonalds I have ever been everyone honking on the drive trun people screaming they have been waiting forever very stressful environment
28124,2,"Manages to allow something to screw up anything Everytime I came here for 6 days in total Normally I do not eat at McDonalds but this place is very close to where Im staying

They have new electronic ordering system using touchpad on giant vertical screen Still gets my order wrong 80 percent of time What Asks me what drink I want Then I just get the cup so why ask me One day I leave the locator number on table while I go bathroom Locator and food is gone Takes me a while to get it sorted outforgets my drink again

One sauce dispensor just explodes pop knocks the container out of my hand under strong pressure Gets little sauce on my clothes not too bad but Jesus Christ One night lot of drinks do not work except for coke yuk  few other things not worth mentioning They get swamped a lot nad hardly can keep up

Otherwise place is relatively new looking as well as private bathroom with your own stall and sink Clean"
31270,2,Well it might have been ok if I was not rushing but I still stayed for my items For this to be McDonalds they should know that its busier during certain hours then othersthere were soo many ppl in line the average person would have turn right back around n walked out
28086,2,For kids its probably nice but adults running through or driving through for a quick bite you have to basically explain what you want on your burger Ordered 2 mcdoubles with cheese and 2 small fries and they were so dry they were kinda crunchy without cheese or even fully cooked Had to trim off parts that were either undercooked or too hard to eat And with burger being so dry its almost like you need a medium drink to even eat the burger and sadly I started with the fries And to top it all off after using a card in the drive through i never got a receipt Never going back Would rather go to checkers across the street
31291,2,Burgers are always flat Good for on the road food I sure do miss the dollar menus tho And they charge for mayo if you add it but not if you get packets humm
6946,2,Got my small order wrong 
6994,2,Overall looks like its falling apart Ice cream machine broken half the time mcflurry machine couldnt mix in the Oreos roof is leaking
6993,2,The soda machine wasnt functioning so they had to get your drink from the one behind the counter the self order kiosks were all down ordering took a little bit longer due to one cashier
31328,2,Today June 22 2017 at 2105 aka 825 my order was taking in drive thru I ask for Double chesse burger with no oins and no pickles with large sweet tea extra ice add lemon So my drink had no extra ice or lemon and frys I drive home to eat my food which I stay 22 mints away from store it by my school I get hone to open my bag to have only receive Hot  Spicey and no Frys which was not my order and young lady at both windows ready my order back I have called the store 8 times to speak with manager and nobody has pick up the phone
2822,2,Very small McDonalds much better hamburgers in Colombia
31316,2,The customer service is just not what it used to be There is no Welcome to McDonalds just how can i help I ended up payimg for someone elses order At 1st i thought it was more but it was 20 cents less Im glad i only go there for drinks
6967,2,Absolutely done with this location I always seem to get the same woman at the drivethru I dont know her name but I know her voice and she screws up every single time then when I try and correct her she gets mad and acts like its my fault I dont know if shes special needs or something or theres a learning disability or if shes hard of hearing I dont get it And even lately when I hear its her I actually make sure to enunciate clearly but it doesnt seem to help The young man that I occasionally get is always on point he has never messed up an order Im guessing she is related to management or has incriminating photos or something She has absolutely no people skills and I will not go back to this place
31313,2,My family and I get to this McDonalds we are shocked it looked so nice from the outside and they have the jungle themed play house I ask if they have an outlet so that I may charge my laptop and phone and no The WiFi here is not even strong enough I could not complete my homework  Bummed out  Not the best as usual
6964,2,This store is so disorganized plenty of people working not all that busy yet took 27 minutes to get food Im sure this is not the mcDonalds model
6963,2,Ended with a caramel frap all over my cup holder My burgers had MC sauce all over it like they dipped it into the sauce Just be careful I know is fast food but my car ended up super messy after my small meal
6962,2,I dont know how youve been called in 24 When I came to 330 in the morning it was 3 people in there and they say was close How does a place advertise 24hr drive thru and only take cash after midnight I dont see how corporate agreed with this
6959,2,Dining room closes at 7pm  No self serve beverages  Dont understand that at all  The food is still good though just have to put some ketchup on a Big Mac  
28073,2,During the Daytime its alright but at night they block one of the entrances with trash cans and lock the other one EVEN THOUGH THE SIGN STATES 24HR DINING ROOM So youre forced to drive through I didnt expect much but whatever
6955,2,"Sometimes the closing hours are not reliable I cant tell you how many times Ive had to cancel an uber eats order for delivery because somewhere the order was accepted but this place was closed Disappointing to the customer who was looking forward to that late nightwee hours of the morning food and infuriating to me because thats MY TIME wasted and money not going into MY pocket aka not getting paid for delivery

On a personal note Ive had MANY upon MANY confrontations with the people who give me the food  I ONLY drink REGULAR dr pepper and as an avid soda drinker since elementary school now 51 I know the difference between regular and diet  it seems like if you come here after a certain hour even though Ive asked for REGULAR DR PEPPER I always seem to get one that tastes like a diet one I have had them give me 3 dr peppers in one drive thru order just to end up with something that clearly was NOT a regular one In addition to having the attitudes checked from those that gave me BIG ATTITUDE for being so I guess insistent that this was not regular dr pepper I would also examine the machines when they run low or tell the employees not to outright LIE about giving me regular dr pepper just to keep 140  which btw Im curious as to why I was charged 141 for a large at this location when Im ALWAYS charged 140 at the one on mathilda"
6950,2,Place smells security staff is a joke
31295,2,Their ubereats need to be more attention to detail n packed nice not just thrown in always missing something i asked for bought the big breakfast meal and got sent no silverware no syrup nothing like Damn how am i going to eat this i even put a note in the app to add napkins and condiment n still cant receive it whats the point of leaving a note if no one reads it Ive order different times and never fail to disappoint me
28126,2,Very disappointed that there was no indoor seating Doors were locked Drivethru only Needed to sit at a table and eat Decided to eat elsewhere
6867,2,Better and cleaner than I thought it would be
6852,2,Same as everywere i dont like mc donalds
6851,2,Needs twice the security and not very clean
6768,2,Quarter pounder needed to be microwaved as soon as I got it
6763,2,If You go at night time There are alot of people just hanging around It disgust me sometimes
6762,2,Too many homeless people sleeping inside Restroom nasty not cleaned 
31181,2,When this McDonalds first opened OMG it was cool seeing the zoo theme The animatronics made noise and moved The service WAS excellent But now it looks like a tourist trap Some days youll sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking spot Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain its quality that it had As far as the food goes Well its McDonalds same as any other
2976,2,Came here at 430a thought it was supposed to be open 24 hours  saw a mcd employee inside and he had the door tied off with a trash bag said they were closed idk bout that seemed a little off
6760,2,I like going to McDonalds for their coffee drinks and the dollar drinks I dont eat there
6758,2,Staff is surly not clean druggies in the bathroom
28199,2,Food cold and forgot items food was replaced so only 2 star Im afraid
6733,2,I did not like the food here service was great though
3008,2,Ordered a large unsweetened iced tea  Received a large cup of something  Barely colored water Guy asked me if I wanted another  I said no if it comes out of the same pot then the next wouldnt be any better  I left with some colored water pretending to be tea
3009,2,The Atmosphere must change  Too much homelessness
6721,2,Too many addicts sittingstanding blocking doorway cant come in or out
28216,2,EVERY TIME THEY FORGET SOMETHING And i mean everytime I have heard conversations about general nonsense take priority over customers while waiting The employees generally juat dont seem to care with the exception of a few
31139,2,SLOW SLOW SLOW and the younger people there are so RUDE New renovation but same slow workers and RUDENESS this past Saturday waited 15 min in drive thru and never placed an order we as many as 10 cars backed out and left
28220,2,They need better customer service The people in the drive thru are so rude that I almost came out my professional skin Get it together McDonalds 192 McDonalds close to go cart place
6769,2,Bad location Unfortunately this place is taken over by homeless and beggars
31344,2,I like that it is animal theme and has a playground but the cashiers are rude and they cant get your order right so they get mad when you tell them you are missing something Also they are dirty
6771,2,Well they have problem with order to receive time mostly because of crowd
2942,2,Poor 
28141,2,Had a crispy chicken sandwich which was ok small case and fries which resembled a form of spaghetti I should of gone to ChickfilA
6848,2,Some workers are so anger and do not attend in a good way
31241,2,Always something with this location Either system down only cash or sometimes no respond on the drive thru at nights
6844,2,Ghetto
31235,2,Awful experience It was 1015 and I needed a sweet tea and nuggets I order my tea in the drive through line The line was pretty long When I got to the window to pay the cashier with light brown eyes said they could only take cash I said what I have stayed in this line this long and no one said a word I said for my inconvenience I would like to have the tea She looked strange and I said please let me speak to your manager She spoke to someone and the manager said no and wouldnt come to the window AWFUL
6832,2,Was good but need to cook the bacon
28154,2,"I visited this establishment as the kfc over the road was a let down like no other
Only pro here was that I got what I actually ordered however what a game trying to order it
The lady was not listening at all and just started adding anything and everything to my order
She was ruder then my explicit Eminem album and when I finally got to sorting out my order it was awful My chicken nuggets tasted like chewing on the chickens feet fresh out of the pen
My Apple pie was questionable to if it was even a pie or not
They only gave me bbq sauces like who doesnt want ketchup 
The best thing about the meal was driving out of the establishment never to look back again

2 start because it was better then kfc"
6826,2,They dont  provide refill service And burger without onions
6817,2,This  is not good there price is different from all the other McDonalds very expensive
2924,2,Poor 
6807,2,Great place except for no vegan burger 
31211,2,Food was definitely not even close to being fresh ishand the location although youd think is convenient after visiting the zoo  Its a wreck waiting to happen if you try to drive in to their location
2934,2,Poor 
2938,2,Poor 
28172,2,Didnt get anything to eat this time  because they CLOSE THE LOBBY AT 10PM Didnt go through the drivethru cause Im on a motorcycle What kind of dingus closes half their store to customers in Old Town
31199,2,"They where not friendly The girl at the drive through was on her phone and didnt give us change or receipt Got to the 2nd window was handed our drinks and asked to pull in a spot Waited at least 15 mins before anyone came out to our car Asked what we orderedand for our receipt which we didnt have
Finally brought our food out and 2 burgers where wrong"
7008,2,Consistently gets our orders wrong Including a time when we were complaining to the manager about constant errors and she was adamant that her team doesnt get orders wrong they handed us the wrong order Nothing wrong with the food but the staff needs better training
2805,2,It is clean but they do not turn on the heating in the childrens area and the manager ignores this request
7010,2,Friendly staff but fries were stale  They even took some time to put together my order giving me the appearance that a fresh batch of fries were coming out of the fryer  I was wrongthey tasted like they were scraped off the floor  Was here around 9pm last night
31470,2,Went to order something to go  I get it that theres a long line that
27979,2,Only go here because its open late Food not always the same presentation or great tastingbut it is McDonalds What do you expect You know when you go there what youre getting Cheap foodpoor customer service And maybe your order correct
2675,2,Good
2679,2,Prices are over prices
7192,2,Not busy but slow service Very unkept restaurant garbage scattered and fountain drinksice depleted
31456,2,better than mostbut the burger meat was cold fries was hot and good tho
7185,2,Rude drive through operator
31452,2,"This manager tru me out
Siad a was not welcome n his store just cus o told they need open at 5 am"
7183,2,Just like any McDonalds  no trill the employees can be  jackass to some people
31449,2,It was dirty there were flys and they got my order wrong When I asked to get my right items they acted like I Was wasting their time I switched to J n B now
27989,2,All I had was a hot fudge sundae which was good The restaurant did not have running water at the time though so I was unable to wash my hands in the bathroom or to order a soda They legally should not have been open They were still running things as usual though
7178,2,They were out of chicken nuggets there was no ice in the soda machine and there was a bean in our big mac Does McDonalds even have anyrbing with beans in it
31440,2,My fries were cold thats all I ordered and took 14 minutes
2705,2,Yuck
28001,2,There is a theme with drive thru only restaurants cold food and watered down drinks and if dont check your bags well enough before you drive away and your order is wrong you cant just walk back inside and get it fixed you have get back in line and start all over again Open up the lobby people
27976,2,Female cashier was rude and was very unprofessional If you are a tourist and dont know when it is cash only you dont get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going on The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great help I would not want the girl to serve us with that attitude
7161,2,Staff is slow especially at drive thru Drive thru orders almost always wrong  Bathrooms always out of toilet paper Majority of customers coming to this location are rude
7210,2,Terrible customer service insane wait times parking lot is way too cramped for how many people come in  Drive thru almost always has you park around the corner and wait more
31478,2,I saw them hand mixing a shake and my Mcflurry wasnt even mixed Best thing here are the animal sculptures
7274,2,Breakfast was not hot enough hate warm hash brown sausage etcIts getting worst and slop by the day and EXPENSIVE
31504,2,Service was bad waited a long time for my food and coffee Then they gave me the wrong coffee
31498,2,Bad service Very dirty Bums are everywhere  begging for something And did i mention very dirty Id go somewhere else next time
31497,2,They always get my order wrong either they dont give me something or they give me the wrong thing
2636,2,Cold fries dry bread
27947,2,Waited in the drive thru for literally an hour If we werent trapped in line and had been able to leave we would have They didnt give us any napkins and got our order wrong The cashier said its always like this Absolutely not acceptable Especially for a McDonalds Did they forget what FAST food means
7249,2,They never get my order right The service sucks
27958,2,The only reason that I stoped to buy at McDonalds was because of my youngest daughter But what we experienced today put an end to it The employees at this location did not maintain an order serving  customers in the drive thru area As you noticed there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the case The associate instead of been polite talked to us in a not too pleasant tone I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick up Luckily the manager was close by and had the opportunity to address the experience I hope they take this opportunity to improve their customer service skills and provide customers a much pleasant experience
7237,2,I dried going to this place This place messes up more times than getting it right Bad MD
31489,2,Slow service and the food was wrong not once but twice Complete waste of time and money
7232,2,Bad service and take FOREVER Slowest Ive been to This time it was because the guy was calling the wrong number for my order
27962,2,I stopped here yesterday for a quick breakfast on my way to work I got a bacon egg and cheese mcgriddle the hash brown and a caramel frappe I ended up with food poisoning 
27969,2,I should never have to wait more than 5 to 10 minutes for fast food Waiting for over 20 minutes in the line now and I still havent gotten my food I understand this is Midsummer but they knew this was coming before hand They should have the staff and the facilities to handle the business demand This McDonalds sucks
31481,2,By far one of the dirtiest McDonalds Ive ever been to 10 dirty tables the entire time we were there No hand sanitizer
31480,2,Just a rude staff who seem to have a bad attitude  Order was correct and fine just rude people
31473,2,Depends on the worker that you get can either be really nice or really rude What can you expect from McDonalds in oak cliff
27509,2,"There worse  Wet lettuce  or dead
Fries or nasty burnt dried up 500 Sunday Sept 25  Made attempt  to call management  but kept  hanging  up there phone This restaurant  needs to shut down"
28005,2,This place is ridiculously high compared to the McDonalds just down the street 20 for what is normally 10 On top of it didnt even ask if I wanted any sauces with my chicken McNuggets Do yourself a favor and drive the extra couple of miles to any other McDonalds
7155,2,Sold a McFlurry then delivered an unblended pile of ice cream topped with crumbs
28043,2,"Very busy Very dirty One cashier and at least 10 people working Line was long the boy taking orders was moving at half the speed of smell

I watched four groups walk out We should have followed"
7074,2,Against the background of other burgers McDonalds is blown away its a pity that some of the first guys are now lagging behind
28048,2,I visited this McDonalds on my way home from Walt disney world with my kids 8 and 13 I went through the drive through so I could get back on the road to get home our order was not right onions on everything we asked for no onion and short a French fry Also has no ketchup in the bag and I asked for more because our kids use a lot and was told no it was in the bag I do not recommend the drive through
7065,2,You get what you pay for when going to any Mcdonald This is a busy location 9 times out of 10 there is lines and being a 24hr location theyre ice cream machine seems to always be out of order hahah go figure I feel as if the food has become extremely salty at all McDonalds locations over the years not very good Found myself not finishing the food I had ordered And still hungry Go some where better If youve read this far you deserve it
28049,2,Horrible service General manager was in the store at the time Was punishing an employee in front of everybody Shouldve been more professional and took him in the back area I waited 10 minutes no one in front of me and no one in the drive thru and my food still was not fresh Dont recommend this location unless you cant get to a different location
28050,2,Very busy  mad customers long wait times for orders  The staff is trying their best but cant keep up  They need a new streamlined process and only one conductor
7055,2,food is ok just regular McDonald but the drive thru is insanely back late night 30 mins wait time while there are just 3 customers like how is this acceptable Soda machine ice cream machine or the cashier constantly broke down After 35 mins when I finally able to get my food they told me no credit card like what  why dont you tell me 35 mins ago just left right away
31376,2,Always great to go there but they need to work on giving food or right to there customers several cases of not handing me the right stuff
7046,2,Waited 13 minutes for a simple hot fudge sundae seems like my order was not placed on their electronic queue Also pretty understaffed  cashier also dropping fries into fryer and running around doing other tasks
7045,2,Took 10 minutes to order food while standing at the counter due to employees just chatting and ignoring me in plain virw Ordered a side salad and a yogurt parfait bother were less then half filled Overall not good but eventually got service
7043,2,Constantly getting the order wrong on several occasions poor attitude at pick up Worked fast food when I was a kid So easy to do it right and smile to the customer Unfortunately their manager was the one at pick up
7042,2,We enjoyed the food But not the service only for the fact we waiting over 20min and this was 830pm My grandson was waiting on his aunt so she can walk with him and his mom dad for there night walk He has preschool in the morning  And he has to be asleep by 9 and in bed by 830 So as for this gramas point of view An apologiey for the wait or heres a free of anything would have been taken in to consideration would have been excepted  But no nothing from any employee just didnt make me feel McDonalds employees did there job
7027,2,"This location is honestly hit or miss usually employees here tend to be very impatient and rude very rarely would I see someone who actually has good customer service
Also they would get my order wrong from time to time"
2792,2,Although it is said to be open 24 hours but if you go late only the car passage is left And they are all old ink with no service attitude at all Very slow to order Very slow to order Very slow to order Important things are said three times
2797,2,The service is lousy the place is dirty I hope they renew it soon it is a home for homeless people they already have their chairs marked where they sit On one occasion I went out to pick up my car and 5 people were smoking marijuana and it is getting worse and worse It is nobodys MacDonald I hope it changes with your renewal
7081,2,If you find yourself scratching your ears while inside it might be due to very small bugs that most people cant see or dont think the bugs are bothering their ear My vision Better than 2020 both near and far Thanks
31425,2,Restaurant very dirty trashcans were full the whole hour I was there No one even wiped down a table Sad to see there is no pride in anything
7095,2,Lady placing the orders is super nice The crew making the food complete morons Mixwd up order and put wrong condiments on wrong one Its like they just tossed it together Not tomention there is no way itll pass wights and measurmentz I expect competence  Which is clearly lacking here
7102,2,"Sorry but breakfast sandwich was not fresh It was hard bread and as slow as it was on a Sunday  morning everything should of been made  fresh sad I
will not stop at this location again"
7154,2,No smoking in the outside seating is not enforced by the manager In fact I saw an employee hanging over into the dining area to smoke as well
31408,2,Food was cold as their heart And the classic they forgot to add the barbecue
7151,2,I give 2 stars out of five because the ice cream machine wasnt broken twice out of the last five times I came to get ice cream
28008,2,So disappointed I entered this restaurant only to be confronted with a computer taking my order  which was Not working No one noticed we were having difficulty  So frustrating Wont come here again for a long time
28011,2,the drivethru line is super long and aside from that the people who should be taking your order there dont even answer when you get to the ordering station It took us about 15 minutes to get a simple order and that was too long
2728,2,Not that good
28014,2,Sat in drive thru for very long time to be told no fountain drinks no frappes no coffee and food was meh
7137,2,Service goodtables extremely dirtynot enough employees to come out from back counter to even help wipe down
28027,2,The facility is a contemporary fast food restaurant with self ordering stations making orders fast and reliable Notwithstanding the manager needs to work in interpersonal tact with her staff Ultimately the store next to McDonald gives customers a free gift if you bring your McDonalds receipt
7123,2,What kind of McDonalds only open till 700 pm for dining room
7114,2,"Under construction had drivethrough only and somehow didnt have water McDonalds makes the worst breakfast sandwiches but thats not particular to this location

Only pro is open 24 hours"
2739,2,Poor service
7113,2,Made me wait in the drive through overflow parking messed up half my order I should have checked but I wanted to leave by then
7109,2,Ordered a big mac for the first time in 20 years  Very disappointed because there was not enough thousand island dressing in my burger  This will be the last time that I will be eating at McDonalds
7106,2,The clerk is not responsive she doesnt have any reaction when we order Silent for a while
2743,2,Nasty
6711,2,What happened to the employees being happy Sad just said
31825,2,Service are not good
2246,2,The worst McDonalds Ive ever been to
26957,2,Small place recomended for drive thru or take out
26958,2,Typical McDonalds just with REALLLLLLLY long drivethru lines Nothing special nothing to write home about
26959,2,Really long SLOW line at the drive through Took FOREVER
26963,2,Unorganized Couldn
8548,2,Lobby was closed with no sign or reason why no curbside spots and super long drive thru wait Attempts to call to see why lobby was closed but no one would answer the phone
26965,2,Too much mayo and burnt bun Homeless come in and get sodas with old cup  ew
1738,2,Poor 
8542,2,Food was cold nuggets not crispy or fully cooked so disappointed in the frys let down 
8541,2,Food was okay wasn
32174,2,Slow
26981,2,I ordered 2 of thier premium chichen sandwiches  TOTALLY GROSS  AND SOGGY COLD DOES
26982,2,They no longer have chocolate dipped ice cream cones What a shame
8527,2,A lot of stores are Really slow with their service What bothers me more is that no 2 McDonalds has the same rules Is the lobby open today Or at this hour At this store Plus not all have a pickup Especially no pickup for Door Dash They make us go inside
8522,2,"Not open for pedestrians until 11am I had to queue up with my legs as if I were a car When I got to the screen noone answered me  guess it only responds to humans in cars Helpful staff inside directed me to order this way but it didnt work If you dont have a car dont bother
Still reeling from the embarrassment "
1743,2,Poor 
8567,2,The dining room is neglected every morning at this location So much so that the workers refuse to take orders at the register You have to use the keosks and if you want a sausage biscuit in a meal there is no way to order it with cheese in a meal  Half the time the soda says its out of stock unless you order a meal Floor is filthy in front of the soda machines Lids not stocked Garbages in dining room full to overflowing Kid came out and cleaned ALL the tables with the same cloth and no cleaning spray whatsoever
26956,2,Disgusting I love McDonalds but some franchises dont know how to cook the food and this is one of them
32184,2,Dirty
8613,2,Weve gone through three times now and it just seems like the person whos taking your order is n
1711,2,Poor 
26938,2,My cup was fingered by the cashier   Two stars because he gave a new one when I asked
8603,2,Super dirty and very slow It was 11 at night and there was a small staff but I expected more from McDonald
8602,2,These was the 2nd time I had this problem with the same McDonalds I was hoping that the first time just some kind of mistake So I fell for it twice  And at the redickuless price they get like 4 for like 14 of a potato 10 lb for that price in the store  It will not be happening again No more fries from this place And all over 1 cents worth of salt Lmao
32200,2,Chain
8599,2,No idea what time the lobby actually closes but 630 pm is a bit early So headed to the drive through with everyone else and by the time I got my food it was already cold
26943,2,Not good for health as we all know but a little good food
8595,2,30 minutes in the drive through again
8594,2,Took them forever to come to the register to take our order and then they let our bag of food sit there forever before they gave it to us Not happy with our services at all
8587,2,This is my first time eating at this location but probably might try it again for a better review but nothing about my meal was normal except for all the lettuce falling out of my big Mac nothing was excessively old but just seemed like they have us stuff that was about time to get thrown away none of my food was hot it was semi warm the nuggets werent the greatest I dont waste food so I still ate it but I will give this location another shot to see if i can get better food for the price I a paid
32187,2,Wrong order
1732,2,Poor 
1734,2,Poor 
8573,2,This location took really long to process orders and get their line moving I even had a mobile order and at about 1015pm I had to take the drive through Took 20 minutes They kept putting the wrong order on the screen at the ordering area Guy who talked to me was pretty rude when I tried to let him know what was going on Pretty sure it the gentleman in a tie that gave me my receipt
26985,2,Very rude female employee Look like she didnt wanted to work
26988,2,Worst food ever The hamburgers taste like a paper
1758,2,Poor 
8503,2,The tomato on the hamburger tasted FUNKY tonight really gross And chicken nuggets were stale and cold
27028,2,Drive thru is pretty slow
8429,2,The attention was not good Neither the cashier nor the one who gave me the happy meal were kind I asked to change the toy because my son already had it and he responded in a bad way that there was no more
32102,2,A quick snack
8408,2,Okay
32094,2,Ok for kids
27056,2,Dirty  Tight parking lot  Too many homeless people
32092,2,Need to make it bigger
27057,2,No tomatoes  Did not inform when ordering
27060,2,Convient probably would avoid if it wasnt right there
32090,2,Slow
32088,2,Breakfast is ok
27065,2,Attendant didnt listen to what I ordered
1838,2,The service was horrible The kiosk machine printed a record with no numbers on it The staff was calling numbers without saying the order The atmosphere was Workers waiting for their checks  requesting food infront of paying customers Was a very unpleasant experience
1844,2,Ive gone twice after work around 10 and my food is served cold n the most recent they gave me my food n not my drink had to tab on window multiple times to get someones attention to then be questioned about it as if they didnt just give me my food n they watered down the drink because I guess they didnt like having to come back and finish the order I hate to down talk a business but your a fast food chain such things should not be happening
1859,2,I ordered a 20piece nugget and only got 18 nuggets Food was nice and hot though
32113,2,Ok
32209,2,Short handed
32122,2,Order was wrong
8443,2,"I didnt like the service
I did not like the service"
8497,2,The only good thing about the location is its cleanliness I ordered at the kiosk and took a table number for dine in They didnt being me my food I had to grab in from the counter Defeats the purpose of using table numbers Then the employee tried to hold my drink from me Had to tell him I had in fact ordered the drink he took away When I unwrapped the burger it was slanted a good 60 How hard is it to stack a sandwich Staff dont 
8495,2,Usually busy but they get you through there pretty fast Watch out for the homeless people this McDonald
1765,2,Poor 
32154,2,Nice
8484,2,It was bad enough when the dining room soda machine converted to the one nozzle machine but they also did it to the drive thru So now all their soda tastes nasty I thought McDonalds was supposed to have great tasting sodas not sodas that taste like suicides Not to mention their staff cant figure out basic orders and theres a 90 chance your order is going to be wrong in some way Added with the homless going up to every person this spot used to be okay and nows its more like the last resort
8483,2,Service was slow 3 cars went in the other lane before someone helped me in the drivethrough  My mocha tasted more like plain coffee it had almost no flavor
1769,2,Poor 
32142,2,Ok service
27000,2,there was a hair in our food
8461,2,"This was a quick stop for a bite to tide us over with my a couple of the kids with us We went thru the drive thru and even though it was slow business we were put off to wait a couple of minutes and the assistant that took the order was very crisp and short in his interactionHe stated the price and told us to pay at the window where we were completely ignored for another several minutes while he Im assuming took the order for the people behind us When he finally took our payment and we moved forward to the window to receive our order only half of the order was correct and none of the condiments we requested were included That kept us trying to get it sorted
As a supervisor and a manager I would hope review for management as well as employees could be considered in improving the atmosphere It will be a place I will think twice before visiting again
If you plan on stopping in be prepared to take your time to make sure things are correct before leaving Be accountable for your time if you want your order correct"
27002,2,I got 3 sloppy vanilla ice cream cones today
27006,2,Ok food service 0 and prices difference from all other
27011,2,VERY SAD  HOMELESS OUTSIDE  LURKING AROUNDNO  CHRISTMAS MUSIC OR SPIRIT  INSIDE 
8448,2,Well the truth is that it has lost its quality and attention very few employees do not recommend it
27018,2,parking is a nightmare WAY too many homeless near by
8441,2,I have gone several times because it is the one that is closest to me and the truth is that they always give me the wrong order 
1861,2,I did the Drive though the food was warm and it was turn off 
8616,2,So as of late the past month or so they close the store randomly to save face and not overwhelm the low count of night staff they have Its 1230 in the morning no line and the kid working says its going to take an hour  When I knownfor a fact it takes about 10 to 15 min I had placed an order on the app using my free points Looking to get a quick bite on my Sunday night walk home from my usual business and now Im down from 2600 points to 100 pointsAND STILL HUNGARY Yall lucky you get a 2 star update I now have 1600 points Oo yall need to properly train your staff and quite frankly I think you should just overhaul the entire place with new staff because what you have nowSUX
8629,2,This location is frequented alot but the other day was by far the worst experience Ive ever had at this location Not only was I completely disrespected and mocked My food was terrible  almost like they KNEW I was coming Be careful going coming here
8845,2,Fries tasted stale one of the ordered 10 piece nugget only had 9 they forgot Any of the two flavored sauces requested 2 of the 10 piece nuggets were in the order Just not a great day to go to McDs I guess
32368,2,"Awful service they had ran out of everything so we had to order 5 quarter pounders two large fries and 2 reg cokes the sodas were mixed with diet and something else and the quarter pounders were made with three hamburger meets and they were stuffed with Mayo and like 20 pickles disgusting

They made a mess out of the order it was late and somehow 34 dollars later all all we had were three cups of water and one quarter pounder When I asked to Speak to the manager the youn"
8836,2,Fast does not seem to be part of their vocabulary I dont know if they changed management or what but they screw up orders drive thru is slow  most of their employees are rude It wasnt like this in the past
32355,2,Every time I come here EVERY TIME I dont think Ive been able to ever successfully pick up an order from here like ever They either dont have the order or my pickup gets cancelled because of the wait time Smh
8834,2,Customer service is less than impressive Food quality was average Longer than normal wait for basic food order
32334,2,New remodel makes it way more closed off and industrial and cold You get wet sitting under ac vent Printer didn
8855,2,Had a crispy chicken sandwich and it had been sitting under the lamp so long that it wasnt very crispy McDonalds has really changed in the past year wasnt very happy
26867,2,Bad customer service rude they lie about giving u condiments Food is usually missing when u get home
8827,2,Most people are very nice but the guy taking the moneywhat a grump
1579,2,Poor 
8823,2,They had one lane closed which is fine but the lane they had opened made everyone end up lining up in the street
1592,2,Poor 
8812,2,Staff are jerks and are inconsiderate dont ever have the lobby open then gets mad when people that dont have a car go up to drive through
8809,2,The best thing about this visit was there were napkins and waterso I could wipe down a table before eating It wasnt that busy and the food took a while to get order was wrong and the staff had an I don
32325,2,1009pm right now at drive thru first time ever in my entire life have I heard a McDonalds tell you that they are not taking orders until 20 minutes because they ar
8866,2,Hours are wring and they were closed when I went Usually theyre alright bit not the best McDonalds
8871,2,The security officer made me very uncomfortable He starred and starred My mom only got a sweet tea
32391,2,Homeless people walking on  the restaurant asking for money Employees ignore it
1450,2,Poor 
32416,2,I like the new design but the customer service has gone down hill Way too many employees go there on their day off to socialize they hang around the registers distracting emplyees who should be focused on their stations and tending to customers The worst part is that one of the managers a young latino kid was engaged in of these conversations I asked the manager why he wasnt controlling his staff and he just looked at me and laughed
8907,2,Its McDonalds what do you expect
32410,2,They wont mess up your order but you will sit in the drive through for at least 15  20 minutes before you get to order and then wait another 10 minutes to get your food Overall unless its your only option you should drive on to a better run McDonalds
1463,2,Poor 
26837,2,How do you mess up this many orders And the fries were weird Just go to a different McDonalds
32409,2,Cant hate on the workers its Mcdonalds just dont go to this location And good luck trying the drive thru if you have plans in the next 2 hours
32407,2,Warning Check your order every time you come to this location Guaranteed to be missing an item you ordered Dont let them tell you
32406,2,Almost everything I order was wrong I order a Sunday with chocolate syrup and they brought me caramel I also order and paid extra for bbq sauce and they didnt put any the food was also cold  Worst restaurant
8883,2,The cashier doesnt know too much about Mobile Order system causing a lot of time waisted Everything else is ok Except that some customers were frustrated about the new selfordering displays in the store Apparently not for all
1476,2,Poor 
32398,2,the slowest mc Donalds in the world  It is supposed to be 24 hours but they leave it closed to customers and by car mac it takes 15 minutes per customer  I mean I wasted 1h of my life waiting for such a bad and slow service
8882,2,Food was cold and tasteless  Burger wasnt even warm enough to melt the thin layer of cheese
26846,2,Dining room has gnats Told employee but no reaction Maybe the gnats amoing others is why i raely go Was in a giant hurry only reason
32395,2,Bad costomer service slow workers
1596,2,Poor 
8801,2,Its an average McDonalds And i would have rated it 3 stars or higher But there is always   A rude and sometimes and literate security guard who in morning doesnt speak any English the only English he does know is typed on his cellphone which he charmingly shows you if you dont buy something quick enough he says if you dont buy something get out then at night theres another security guard that isnt that much better he does speak English but again all he ever says is by something or leave
8799,2,Im not sure what anyone who has lived in Utah expects when trying to dine in this area Its pretty common knowledge that downtown is the heart of the homeless and many drug addicts Not to mention this location is one block from pioneer park and very close to the road homegateway area Im not excusing any rude or bad experiences but maybe just a bit more patience and compassion Its fast food Dont like the area Dine elsewhere
26880,2,There is an entrance fee upon entering and exiting the drive thru LOL
8695,2,"First and last time to this McDonalds Had to stand around for 20 mins aside from only 2 people being there One employee caught an attitude when i asked for no pickles None of the burgers were wrapped right And they were so lazy about they job that at first they wouldnt even come to the register to take my order Kept staring at me expecting me to use their damn machine
Customer service and being polite goes a long way ladies And learn how to wrap your food"
8694,2,This is more of a homeless shelter than a McDonalds
1660,2,Poor 
1666,2,Poor 
8686,2,Frys were cool and soggy The double quarter pounder wcheese was slapped together were one beef paddy going one way and the other one going the other It was stuck that which made it hard to eat
8685,2,The old standby of a 14lb wcheese fries and a coke was a disappointment A warmed over hamburger patty that wasnt warm enough to melt the chee
8671,2,Good  service but I had told the waitress   not to take my tray and that I had to go out to get a portable battery for my phone Upon doing so the security officer harassed me about smoking when I had not lit my smokei then waited for his instructions when he started to speak  it was in espaniol and he pointed toward the street I was somewhat confused and a bit worried about my LG Coffee and a set of glovesso my question  is why Make your restaurant so user friendly and then harass its patrons after a good dining experience
32247,2,Im upset because they didnt put an egg in my Mcmuffin
32246,2,Comfortable and childrens play area The service is very slow
1697,2,Poor 
32223,2,Its McDonalds
26924,2,It was ok  cheep on handling out ketchup and I asked for mayonnaise  they said they didn
8649,2,We went through the drive thru and to start it took too long for anyone to come over the speaker and then they were quiet and hard to understand One of the things we ordered was a number two He was asked what size he wanted and what to drink as part of the order They didnt give us fries with our combo meal and when the manager FINALLY noticed me he gave us a medium fry not the large we ordered
26928,2,Very dirty and staffisnot friendly at all They act like they dont like their jobs
8635,2,"Really didnt care much for the area

Homeless people in and outside of this restaurant Not that I dont like them but made me feel very uncomfortable eating meal with my small child The lady that took my order overcharged me The food tasted great Even put a Happy meal toy with my big Mac  but Im not complaining everyone loves Olaf  Restaurant has recently been remodeled and seemed fairly clean I probably wont go back But it was okay"
32284,2,Got me waiting for to long to take my order
8627,2,Dine in experience was really not fun  Went there to have a nice breakfast out and the cashier got into a screaming match with a customer and other customers got involved Bad vibes all around Food was fine as its pretty much the same everywhere I drive twice as far to go to a different McDonalds even though dinein isnt even offered right now 
8708,2,Was forced to use the kiosk If you need to pay in cash you have to still use the kiosk then go the the cashier with your receipt and pay Check out takes a lot more time the food is not prepared any faster and the dining room or bathrooms arent any cleaner So there is no advantage to the customer
8715,2,McDonalds was fine the people I went with sucked But honestly this place is really sketch they even have a security guard at the front door in case things go sideways If you are wondering HOW things could go sideways you wouldnt have to expand your view further then the amount of druggys that go to this McDonalds Half of them dont even buy anything they just stand around to heat up I presume waiting for the security to kick them out The other half stand in line and figure out that they cant buy anything at the front desk then leave Normally I wouldnt have a problem with this if they kept to themselves like everyone else ordering something at the McDonalds but they would  randomly yell ask questions pan handle and just were being a general nuisance I understand that an establishment cant control who their costumers are so its not exactly the MDs fault but still this Micky Ds should be avoided at all costs for that reason I give them 2 stars instead of one because the good customer service and magically clean bathroom Seriously these cashiers have to deal with a lot of weird stuff and they somehow arent mentally broken by the end of the day I went at 11 at night which probably affects my review but from the first impression Im not inclined to go again to find out how it is in the day unless it was simultaneously the only restaurant I was starving more than a communist in the gulag and I lost my ability to cook food myself Seriously dont go here its horrible
32308,2,It was clean and we order from the touch screen  menu  The place was small and not crowded  
8792,2,Tell me how I end up with a double cheese burger whose patties resemble a sloppy joe My hamburger looked like they cleaned up the grill of all the pieces and threw them on a bun But I got it quickly and my coke and fries were good so I gave them 2 stars
1603,2,Poor 
8789,2,Not gonna lie my nuggets came kinda undercooked
32307,2,We were waiting in drive through 20 minutes every day  The speakers broke for at least a week and there was only one girl in the store at 11 pm thats super cra
8780,2,It was 3am when I went through the drive threw I ordered a sausage mcgriddle 4 burritos 5 hash browns Everything was hot except the mcgriddle It was completely cold and I had to warm it up in my microwave when I got home Then called the store and spoke with a manager about the situation
32305,2,Service was all great but it was dirty all over it had a very foul odor
8768,2,They get you in the drive thru I bought big breakfasts and made sure I got the syrup and forks The employee rolled her eyes because I seemingly didn
8764,2,"Fast food fast service Low quality meals But you will probably already know that because it is a McDonalds fastfood and not a whole foods Cafe organic foods
The food price is above normal for what you are getting So the value is low in the area of food quality for the price What you are paying for is convenience They have a very fast drivethru"
1612,2,Poor 
8749,2,Picture a mcdonalds in a pretty rough area They have a security guard You need permission to go in the bathroom People are begging Seems dirty You cant expect it to be the best one The staff seem friendly for the most part and my food comes out fairly fast tastes decent  I have noticed the buns are stale slightly around the edge at this location more than once I havent had that happen at any others really I wonder why that is
32301,2,This is NOT 247 Maybe Fridays and Saturdays but at the time of this review 440am It is not open Staff still inside and not takong orders
32291,2,Third time coming and third time Ive been served after a long wait Often there is not a line yet there is still a wait Food is good like at any other McDonalds but the service is so slow
8729,2,The service was good Got through the driveway quickly with the right order but as I was leaving a homeless person tried running towards me screaming at my dog
26891,2,Went thru the drive thru and they forgot 2 fries and reversed my request I asked for no lettuce they gave me lettuce only
26899,2,20 minute wait for 2 egg McMuffins
27115,2,Limited parking and alot of traffic
1867,2,"Decent McDonalds but I would prefer avoiding this one especially at certain times after school hours Lunch maybe And some evenings it is packed with unbearably loud and annoying kids teens sometimes even adults There are some nice employees but the order is always wrong
Food is consistently good though"
1873,2,Always very disappointing Ive gone to this McDonalds for 15 years now The system has gotten more organized since the recent renovation but it seems the efficiency still has not improved The workers are nice and willing to help The seating area is much better The biggest issue would be the lack of efficient service Ive seen people leave after ordering because it would take so long Hopefully itll be improved
27429,2,Food was good Everything was right but they never have any of the toys offered on the mconalds preorder app exept for what they call inisex which is really just for boys and were very short with me and rude when i asked for a proper toy for my little 2 yr old daughter She is obviously not into a avengers
8060,2,I ordered based on a picture of the sandwich and did not have lettuce tomatoes etc
8059,2,Do not ask A joke  both the staff and food Its sad the quality had fallen so far
31883,2,Food order was incorrect twice
31881,2,Subpar customer service and meal craftsmanship
8056,2,Food is never fresh when I order
8063,2,Service was slow girl on her phone
27439,2,"They watered their parking lot with a poorlyengineered irrigation syztem right before days of hard freezelet everyone skate through the ice for a day before closing during the majority of the freeze when everyone needed a hot meal
Whataburger stayed open and served a limited menu to support Roanoke"
2167,2,No refills on drinks owner keeps ac on low making it hot inside School kids sit at all seats taking up space and are noisy
27440,2,"This McDonalds sucks They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double drivethru but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this McDonalds The management

The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good drivethru timer because you will always have to pull up at this McDs Always Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times 1 burger  fry at 3pm  pull up next to the 34 other cars already there

The one manager Ive had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as well I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order that I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes for no less and decided I just wanted it refunded to my card The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me cash The best part He made me pull up to get the cash

So again Mismanaged terrible McDonalds Its a franchise for a reason this one just stinks"
31880,2,Cheap only reason to go lol
2171,2,Always seem to end up with missing items from my order
8044,2,Its realy bad when the register personnel cant count change that is done by the computer infront of there face
27442,2,They seemed overwhelmed at lunch in Drive thru Very slow Then when at window was asked to pull forward when simply ordering a number 2 with nothing special added Seriously a quarter pounder takes extra time to make Now I remember why I dislike McDonalds
8049,2,Order was wrong third McDonald without ice cream machines
2155,2,Possibly the worst Mcdonalds in Queens The service is absolutely terrible I saw a rat in between the two entrance doors The employees had done nothing about it Disgusting
27426,2,This people always try to rush you on the drive through and even if you go inside store there are always problems with food last time I went over there I had 2 cold cheese burgers had to wait for my wifes food and came the wrong way If you want to eat bacon tomato and onions good luck trying to find them in burgers there are just 1 piece to none hahaha
8075,2,I realized that i got the wrong sandwiches when I got homeit happened beforecustomer service needs needs major improvement
31908,2,The food was dry and cold

8130,2,Extreamly slow took over 30 min to get food
27394,2,Delivery complete joke Dont bother taking the time to order sauces for your Nuggets I ordered 20 spicy  40 reg picked out at least 9 different dipping sauces as required  not to mention Desired by my kiddos We did NOT get ONE sauce or even a ketchup Just to make sure they were consistant with disregard they didnt even give us straws either to go with our 3 mango smoothies2 of them So 60 NuggetsNO sauces  AT ALL  Not the first time they have done us wrong on the Nuggets so buyer should be cautious

8111,2,Not good parking area or access Very slow service Very small
2137,2,service is good but I would recommend cashier to change their gloves when touching money cleaning counter and then touching food at the same time
27402,2,Went through the drive thru in a hurry to get my daughter to school we found a hair in our food and was given the wrong drink The manager on duty was very apologetic and gave me a refund Even though I was disappointed with the hair in the food we were treated very kindly and had no problem getting our money back
27412,2,The food is fine Service at the drive through is horrendous Unprofessional and unhelpful  Its good that ther
8085,2,Watered down fountain drinks with no fizz plenty of loiterers hanging around for a long time with just a cup of coffee
27420,2,I hate it when I point out a problem and the management tell me that thats the way its supposed to be  I managed a McDonalds for many years  I know better I still order their food regularly all over the country  I know better The new manager has made things much better but standards still slip back to the old ways when hes not here
8078,2,I went there at about 850 and they were not serving food for some reason at that time
8041,2,Theres nothing special about McDonalds and most of the people working here act like theyd rather be somewhere else

27490,2,Order some food and they forgot to give me  my Cheeseburgers I always check the bag before I leave I told them and the girl said it was in thereI told her you want to come and check
31838,2,Bad service and attitude from the employees
27492,2,The service at this McDonalds is always spotty this time they made my iced latte a hot latte not a big deal but they consistently mess up the orders and I love McDonalds in general
27493,2,We go to this McDonalds because they had a really cool electronic board that the kids could play on it was interactive and very neat well for the last five times they tell us the board is broke we only get a drink there Im so we only go to for the play area and since its broke my son has been very sad
7928,2,If you forget to put an item in a customers bag and they have to come back to reclaim that missing item it
7924,2,Drive through took 15 minutes Food was cold Employees didnt say a word to me Pretty rough They got the order right so they get 2 stars
27503,2,The manager did not have all the equipment working the order was messed up and they did not have the option to do Google or Apple pay or take credit cards or scan anything on the McDonalds app

31909,2,customers service need improvements
27355,2,"Perhaps the most poorly run McDonalds in Texas Visited on the weekend  so naturally busier but the management attitude of employees and physical condition make this a location in my opinion the worst location weve ever visited
1 Trash everywhere see pic for example Trash on the floors tables parking lot
2 Dirty tables Obviously tables get dirty So we asked if a team member could wipe down a table to remove ketchup and prior visitors"
8164,2,It took 18 minutes to get two cheeseburgers and a Coke
27179,2,Wasnt as good as normal
8308,2,too greasy and cold
1934,2,This McDonalds had a full makeover but the customer service has went down since then Today was the second time in two weeks that they got my order all the way wrong I
1942,2,What the owner should monitor is the attitudes of spanich servers she has nasty attitute she is on the heavy side i dont know her name we were just asking for an xtra ketsups bcause the kids askd for it n her reply was omg nasty
1944,2,Im allergic to onions I tell them every single time to not add onions and for the last 3 visits my burgers continue to have onions put on I end up switching my meal with my wife because she doesnt want me to get sick or go hungry I worked at McDonalds its not that difficult to build a burger without adding onions DO BETTER
27192,2,S l o w
1949,2,I only come here late at night  Staff do okay they seem pretty busy with drive through or other tasks  The dining room stays dirty for a long time while the cashiers are helping out behind the line even if there are only a few customers
1952,2,"Use the drive through to order The girl gave me the wrong flavor soda I told her what i ordered and she gets angry and says ok pull up to the next window for your soda
I say no Ill wait here please just give me my soda She would rather argue then just fill the cup with soda She tells me that Im making everyone in the drive through wait I said no McDonalds sloppy order taking is making me wait I encourage everyone to not pull up out of the way when fast food restaurants screw up They do that so corporate doesnt yell at them for having slow initial order to window pickup time Do the job right and orders will be fast"
27202,2,The service was slow
32001,2,Theyre no help
1973,2,"TlDr poor service frequently gets orders wrong

We try and avoid this place even when we specifically have a hankering for McDonalds We always have an issue at this McDonalds no matter what time of day  whether we order from a food delivery service or in person The orders always get screwed up  from missing items to getting a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle that just had cheese If there was other fast food options besides pizza and halal nearby wed probably never go here again
But today I finally understood why its a mess theres no communication It was a busy time since school had just let out and I stood for about 5 minutes waiting for a Dr Pepper and watched the crew work in relative silence while pushing out food orders without tickets and without speaking to each other Anyone who has worked in food service knows a quiet kitchen spells more trouble than a loud one Eventually my sister flagged down the man doing drink orders and asked if the drink hed just placed in the row of 8 other drinks hed been setting down indiscriminately was our Dr Pepper and he said yesit was a Coke
Management here really needs to have a talk to the crew about working together as a team and communication especially when its busy Yes its just a McDonalds and Im not expecting white glove service from a fast food joint but our community deserves better than what were getting for sure"
31984,2,Very slow service
1990,2,"The best thing about this McDonalds is the cleanliness compared to most McD restaurants in Queens The worst thing about it is the staff They pay no mind to customers waiting in line to have their order taken even when it isnt even busy in the slightest Sometime they dont give me my receipt Sometime my order will be ready in the bag but theyll set it aside and realize it much later as I watch them complete other orders wondering why mine is taking too long and it turns out my order was read all along they just never bother to call the number I can go on and on almost everyday its something different
Two stars is the best I can do"
1993,2,Never get my order right in the drive through then told to pull over we will bring your food in a moment Defeated the whole point of the drive thru experiance dont you think If it wasnt for my child wanting his happy meal I myself always make it a point to skip this place
1996,2,Missing items in order 1606 on 07232022 You guys need to pay attention it

1922,2,Well we went for breakfast first off all the girl at the front wanted us to use the ordering machines to place our order and than presided to say that they didnt sell breakfast past 1100am so the manager than said to place oder by the register which that is what we wanted to do in the first place  well we ordered finely and than to realize that gave us half of what we ordered 
32042,2,Good customer
1887,2,Ordered Uber Eats No drinks or cookies were in my order Cold food
8344,2,Cheap bugers
1889,2,In store experience is generally better than delivery Order breakfast for my whole family all that was delivered was 2 orange juices When I asked the driver he said he even asked if there was any food and stated the employee said no Not sure who would only order orange juices for the trouble and price the corner store juice is way better Deliveries need to be handled better not the first time missing items or a whole order
27133,2,Its good for an emergency
1892,2,They are not 24hrs them doors are locked after 10pm  open at 630AM  Breakfast Ends at 10AM they just backwards

27148,2,Bad customer service
27150,2,No outlets and to crowded
27159,2,Its fast food
1914,2,I like the convenience of this McDonalds for  parking and drive thru  the food is fresh and the place is cleanthough I think because of the Covid increase they dont let anybody sit inside My problem is the workers organization Nobody is at the register or someone to help you at the kiosk One kiosk machine did not give you a receipt another gives you just a white paper Long wait to pick up order took like 20 minutes Once you get your order it is missing items from your order Today I was missing hashbrowns I also ordered hot chocolate with caramel and I got coffee  instead I did not change it because two weeks ago the same thing happened and I had to wait 20 more minutes for them to give me the hot chocolate I thought that was an isolated incident but it happened again today For this reason Im not coming back to this place ever again Goodbye
27160,2,Tables dirty
1926,2,Its a busy place  Employees are not very friendly I only come to this location for the convenience but they usually very slow  I always need to check my orders before I leave because they frequently missing stuffs or got it wrong
7897,2,Horrible I hate to have to say that because I love Mc Donalds No toilet paper no hand soap in the restroom and just plain dirty When I told the manager she sent an employee to take care of it I saw that he went in with the items and came back out and continued wirking with thebsame glives he used in the restroom Really When I ordered they got the order wrong no napkins in both napkin holders and no salt In the dinning room most of the tables were dirty The worst part is that they were not busy Make it right please

Their morning management and workers need much more improvement they make you wait as long as 15 minutes to receive your order
Dont go to this McDonalds unless you plan on being late to work"
27330,2,I ordered a fish burger and it only brings the bread the fish and mayonnaise I expected it to bring lettuce and tomato but no I think it would be better with luchuga and tomato
8175,2,Customer service is not that good so
2106,2,I went to get iced coffee this morning and they say we dont have iced coffee
27344,2,Poor 
27346,2,the heavy set woman with the short cut quick weave with glasses is very rude and miserable looking  i stood there waiting on the doordash order for 20 min and she didnt ask how could she help me she didnt say anything  she was skipping over the doordash order  and just let me stand there then when the order was done she threw the bag

2003,2,This McDonalds is ok but in the morning I always have to worry about whether they are going to do my coffee right The other day they gave me black coffee when i asked for light and sweet Situations like this is a regular occurance  In addition there is a male manager there who yells at his employees all the time Once he pounded on the drive through window and yelled toward me to get my attention Not a very nice gesture at all
27301,2,Maccas is what it is
31960,2,No toys in kid meals
2006,2,"This place is known to always get your order
wrong or they ask you to pull over so they can bring it out Today my order was missing something when I asked why the person at the window gave me an attitude and asked me pull out By the way the person who took the order had a headset and she was on her phone"
2012,2,I Placed my order on the app on 72121 and paid for meal through the app when I got close to the restaurant I place my order after arriving 10 minutes later my order was still not ready I stood at the pick up counter and had to fine someone to help me which took another five minutesThere was absolutely no one at the counter to help

2030,2,"Not a very pleasant McDonalds to visit
1 the area for the lines is small So expect to be cramped when its busy and be confused as to where the lines are and where they start
2 the employees are not friendly I wouldnt say theyre mean but they obviously dont care about any pleasantries or seem to care about you
3 there is no where in the store an area where you can grab napkins or ketchup or straws You have to go up to the counter and ask them for packets and straws and utensils during lunch time when lines are longer and its getting congested at the counter it makes it worse when people have to constantly come up to the counter and ask for something

I dont recommend coming here if you want to stop and relax for food"
2034,2,I recommend going here if youve ever cut me in line chewed loudly during a movie or screwed me over in general as this place tends to take longer than most and taste worse too Ive gotten some poor service on multiple occasions Id say I wont ever be back but this McDonalds is open late and too close to my house
2035,2,Im doing Door Dash The servers are young they spend a lot of time talking to each other and Not paying attention to the window Door Dash items are on the counter Waiting to be passed to drivers
31971,2,Just ok service
2043,2,Well They finally put the right prices up on the drive thru menu I asked for a coffee with milk with my meal they said what size I said whatever is included with the meal They gave me a medium with cream and charged ne an extra 50
27289,2,Not to crazy about
8214,2,This food will kill you
2060,2,It looks clean food is like any other McDonalds  Disappointed the playhouse is not there anymore That really made this place worth going to Gave the community ties to this particular mc Donalds Ill be going to the one thats closer to my house from now on RIP RONALD MC DONALDS PLAY HOUSE   SINCE I COULD REMEMBER  2020

6710,2,"Great service horrible atmosphere
Like times square in 1982"
28224,2,We really cant understand how hard it can be to complete our order Every single time we go they make multiple mistakes n its so frustrating
4210,2,They were cleaning surfaces while simultaneously serving food off them and i dont mean they were drying there was water sloshing And bizarrely my 10 piece mcnugget order was ready and bagged up on the counter before I even paid I ordered at a kiosk so no one overheard my order and acted fast I got to the train station a block away and opened my food to find that my food was soggy and slightly brownish Dont eat here at night
29012,2,I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and it was tough and undercooked I do not recommend
5540,2,Didnt like the quality of the food
30149,2,Sorely disappointed Outlets in every wall and not a single one working The girl at counter looked at me like I was dumb the entire time I tried to order and seemed like she didnt have a clue how to answer any question I asked The guy sweeping the lobby was very cordial and actually tried to warn me none of the outlets worked so kudos to him Place was clean enough I guess
30145,2,The service was TOTALLY slow and it took the clerk about 5 minutes before they could even take an order  Im a local and I wouldnt ever go back to this location again Seemed like a LOT of chaos happening when I looked in the kitchen area  Also clerks do NOT have a basic understanding of English This is difficult if youre trying to ask anything of the clerk  Would not recommend
4234,2,They moved fast but it wasnt very crowded The food wasnt that good it was no salt on the fries and my burger was extrs salty Then they gave me orange soda because they didnt have strawberry fanta but thats def not what i wanted If im ever in the area i wont be coming back here
5544,2,Poor 
4242,2,The cashiers seem to have no idea what is going on Mess up orders Literally give small portions Ordered a sandwich and they gave me one of smallest chicken that ive seen I wouldnt recommend this place Find a better McDonalds around
29022,2,As has been for the last year slow slow service Went inside this time no better
29024,2,Dirty slow inefficient They now bring your food to your table They forgot me So my food was colder than usual
4254,2,"Food was the bog standard biggest issues here are
1 The cheeseburger I ordered had a hard bun
2 Service was terribe there should be lines or devides to clearly mark queing lanes rather than someone shouting There are three lines and there be nobody serving in the other 2
3 They messed up my order seems to be the case in every McDonalds in NYC they seem to miss out 2 of the things on my order that being fries or drink
Wouldnt recomend"
29029,2,Pictures are misleading No way does that chicken sandwich is so big liar liar pants on fire
29039,2,Well dont ask them for a cup of ice you might be lucky to get six cubes
5522,2,Breakfast was cold
30137,2,Theres only 1 way to describe my experience Have you ever gone in to a daycare and shook a basket full of babies well I havent but I could imagine what it sounds like and thats how it sounded when I walked in the doors I didnt order anything and the employees were on there phones anyways So 
4204,2,2 different visits The supervisor in the grey shirt was the one give out the food with an attitude like he didnt want to be bothered And I ordered 4 apple pies at night and all of them were old dried out and their box had no sell by time stamped so who knows how long they been in that warmer Probably will place my food orders elsewhere
4200,2,Oct 21 2018 morning they completely mixed up the order starting with the coffee Asked for black coffee opened the cup it had milk in it Ordered bagel bacon and egg and a bacon egg on biscuit both without cheese Got sausage and egg with cheese on bun Went back to switch was assured I got the right order Came to my table and realized again the order was mixed up 3 tries to get the order right Really
29008,2,They dork up the kids meal every time and the fries are never freshbut its a standard place
28969,2,Nice employees but waited 15 min for cold food
4121,2,A friendly and responsive staff delivered twice after I brought it back coffee that was not hot After the second time I just gave my cup to my daughter whose iced coffee was way too light with cream and diluted Surprised that McDonalds quality control failed on this visit
30179,2,"I tried to use a coupon to get a free medium fries from the Mcdonald app along with my other items i purchased and after the scanned the coupon they gave me small fries I even heard them making comments about the free coupon Also the women at the window seem to be fooling around too much hence the extremely long line during lunch and dinner times I stopped by 4 times in one week and had an issue each time

The young white guy at the first window is really nice though hence the 2 stars instead of 1"
28975,2,McDs needs to stop messing with the 1 sodas
30173,2,All that technology and they cant remember how to put two sandwiches in a bag Maybe if they had a few more people instead of LCD screens
4167,2,Its dark Its dirty Carry your own napkins cuz they only give you 1 or 2 Everytime Ive gone the tables have been filthy so have something to wipe them down The food is always good though
5566,2,Poor 
4170,2,Fast service but restroom being locked just avoid tourists using Should have been more organized with a sign for customers use only
4176,2,Manager called me out for seating and eating my food at 11pm There were some seats available Closes at 2am If they dont want folks to sit they need to robe off all seats Manager allowed me to eat
30165,2,We were not impressed with this location They locked the doors at lunch and only ran the drivethrough We made it inside but that wasnt much better The workers were not friendly and I had to order at a kiosk
28995,2,Lost my order while the place was almost empty Chicken tenders were overcooked
5560,2,Poor 
4191,2,This location tends to vary in quality  If its raining I would recommend you not go since they close the upstairs and the seating becomes scarce due to the campers taking up the front of the store When its nice out it isnt much better though since the place is very dark and feels damp I hows think they are trying to help people not eat their food since it is a very unappetizing place to eat
4193,2,I want there today and order a small fries and a chess burger the order came very fast but the cashier was with another customer she was taking order after she finish with customer she didnt even wash her hand or  sanitized her hand or she used glove she want and start putting fires and giving it to customer I didnt even eat my fires  its Covid time be careful
30155,2,On Saturday at 1125am drive through is moving at 4 to 5 minutes per car which works out to about 30 to 35 minutes to get your food from when order was placed Also only use lane 1 and you will go faster
29044,2,Wrong orderswatch what they give youdouble order lanes mean double mistakes
4275,2,"I ordered hot chocolate on machine and when I went to the pickup they told me it was sold out
And the floor is really dirty Clearly this restaurant is out of management"
30125,2,Inconsistency on preparing my daily French vanilla latte Some times perfect sometimes bitter sometimes similar to the much less expensive regular black  Also very inconsistent on getting special orders correct Very friendly crew
4291,2,The food was ok but the staff were just rude and have no idea of what customers are The security guard was a good man tho
30059,2,Line for drivethru was slow and when we got up to order literally a third of the menu said that it was not in stock Be back soon We ended up not ordering
29093,2,Thats all you get Service is mediocre
30053,2,Was so excited for my first time coming to the big McDonalds  because I was told you could order special menu items First disappointment Second not only were there no numbers to grab once you ordered your food but we waited over an hour for a ham and cheese French toast that we watched sit in the window under a heater that wasnt even working for over 20 mins a McDouble and Big Mac and a frozen coffee that was half melted Very disappointing Will NEVER go back The employees were all chi
4404,2,Hotter than Central America in there  Must have been over 40 degrees thats Celsius
29103,2,Customer service pm is awful on morning  regularly personnel is better
4422,2,Dark dirty Homeless seating inside the restaurant with a foul smell
5465,2,The usual rubbery unhealthy mandatory fuel of the day
29108,2,Yuck
4423,2,The place was Filthy and the Seats are All Badly Torn This McDonalds is a DUMP FIX IT UP
29113,2,At least they got my order right
29114,2,Nice people but made us feel sick
29124,2,Slowest McDonalds in the world and cold french fries
29130,2,Not the best place to go your  Older is never right
30031,2,"This particular McDonalds was incredibly slow

My chicken sandwich was overcooked and dry and they didnt put the pickles on it

Overall it took over 15 minutes in the drive through to get my food

Not a great showing from a place that is not expected to be great"
4443,2,good place to stop by if you need to pee
4389,2,Poor customer service Needs better management and SECURITY
30183,2,Soda machine on drive thru window was broken on 12012018 at  around 1030pm The person who was taking the order was kind enough to give me the option to go inside with the cup and use the machine inside but his manager told him he could not offer me that option therefore I was unable to buy a soda Great Management Skills
4386,2,Its NY but come on you cant clean the restroom Also getting the key to use it is a hassle
4362,2,Not so safe but good workers
4293,2,The slowest service I have ever experienced Even after ordering online I wait for far to long for pick up
30115,2,Ordered curbside The attendant came out to tell me that my apple pie would take 15 minutes and he couldnt cancel it He said he can substitute for cookies 15 minutes later I had my order with cookies and still no apple pie Frustrating Their soft drinks are always hit or miss as well because the balance of syrup and water is never correct
4299,2,Machines where broke they messed up my order  there was no real management here at this location it needs alot of work 
4315,2,Lines are usually quite long and dont move very fast If you need a quick meal go across the street to Fresh  Co
5507,2,Food was cold
30101,2,"Service is slow and painful lost McDouble Bundle option on menu for budget minded customers Still giving it 2 stars because employees arent paid enough to say Have a Good Day when you getting order at pick up window

Change my mind next time I drive through and youll get more stars

Like what you see Just say OYE

The Blond One"
4321,2,Not a great experience to be honest They messed up my coffee order and the bathrooms are pretty bad
4323,2,I personally dont like fast food but McDonalds is a mainstay NYC has much more to offer than that as a food choice
4331,2,Restaurant is aged  Chairs mostly torn  Ice Tea is as sweet as syrup
30094,2,Started with me having to get the attention of the Drive thru by saying hello to the order com because 2 cars had passed on my right while i was waiting Then I pulled up to receive my order I was given my drinks but was missing the one from my Happy Meal order as I asked for it and the person at the window looked at me like what was I talking about I said that i am missing a drink and again he looked at me like I was tring to get something again i mentioned that i have 3 orders with a beverage and a frap but i am still missing one then he began to say ok it is coming just pull forward to the next window as i pulled forward they brought me my items and still no drink and was still missing items again they looked at me like i did not know what i was saying and then finally got my HM drink but i was still missing items was told they are in the oven again waited 10 min with no one coming to the window to inform me of the wait I went to the window where thire was a person and again he was confused on why i was still in there line waiting on food then the manger came to the window asking what is the problem I said I am still missing my apple pies he being to tell me they are in the oven and it takes 10 min I asked am i still waiting at the other window or am i pulling to a number lane he said no next window so I pull back up and wait another 7 more min I have now been waiting 20 min for my items  If it was communicated that the wait will be a long wait I would not have felt forgotten at the window
30091,2,I would give 35 stars for the sugar free caramel iced coffee and 1 star for the sausage burritos The burritos were very small half the normal size and very little filling or cheese inside Its been a year since I had a sausage burrito and McDonalds has definitely gone downhill Prices are higher for the burrito and you get less food for the money
29076,2,Its okthe service stinks took too long
30089,2,Largest and slowest in the world Took 25 minutes from when I drove up till I left Took 15 minutes to get my food after I paid Also I did not get a good morningor anything except 739 The cost of my food Extremely bad service and attitudes from everyone I encountered there All for 2 sausage biscuits and a coffee
4355,2,Wendys is better but this place satisfies the munchies Watch out for the dopeheads and crack fiends looking to score
4361,2,Its a crack house that sells McDonalds Everyday All day But NYU is just a few licks away smh
30069,2,They certainly need to take a look at the way they are staffing the night shift This location seems to be very popular at night and yet the management has barely anyone back there making orders There was a giant mob waiting at the registers for their orders Be smarter with your manning
30026,2,When I first pulled up to get breakfast at 533am the man told me to come back in 10mins I said what is this You mean I cant order food right now Yall start breakfast from 5am and go until 11am He said ok you can order but food wont be ready for at least 5min What was weird is soon as I ordered my food was already ready This particular McDonalds is way to busy and big to be pulling slack workers like that The guy seemed like he just didnt want to help
4116,2,This is a below average McDonalds  The selfordering machines dont print receipts with your number so you better catch it on the screen because they may or may not see it on the system  Fortunately I was only getting some sodas and they didnt question my order but if it had been a real order it might not have gone smoothly
4110,2,42523 10pm1030 pm 2 stars for Juan who was a very understanding manager and who completely tries satisfying customer needs by keeping open the restroom for us However the lady working on cleaning duty resisted obeying Juans orders and consciously tried to stop us from using the restroom by creating excuses to the manager such as cleaning time and no paper towels These hardships  invented by 
28820,2,Get a veggie burger already God
28822,2,Everything Very good but I ask for fresh fries and the spanish manager there wanted me to stay with warm fries and I said nofresh fries are fried in the momentthey should be taught to say give us a minute your fries will be fried at the moment because the customer is very important for usand period
30361,2,extremely busyhighly understaffed waited 1 hr in drive thru last resort for my food this is not fast food
5714,2,Poor 
30358,2,"Ordered the Quarter pounders deluxe with cheese no pickle and one with no onion
They both had no lettuce and tomato on them I call them about it and they were glad to replace them I go back and 10mims later we get hot fries and two sandwiches but both had onions and pickles on them
nevergetitright McDonalds"

5698,2,Poor 
28818,2,"Pretty much the definition of meh and ok service Had the unpleasant pleasure of having an older lady by the name of Precious take my order and was just awful She had the worst I dont care kind of attitude Worst yet  I believe she was the shift last or manager

Either way  if you dont care for the customer service the food is usually on par"
28816,2,The food was at McDonalds standards But the upkeep of the restaurant was less than average Garbage cans overflowing Foot prints all over the floor and the fountain drink dispenser wasnt draining Its had about an inch of fluid in the waste catcher You couldnt even set your cups down to fill them up
28815,2,Ordered 2 fillet o fish sandwiches after not having McDonalds for  months ordered Xtra cheese got extra tarter instead Had it remade got no tarter no extra cheese again This is why ppl  are mad you make such a high wage 
30415,2,The service was awful and rude They messed up my order when trying to get it fixed the manager had and attitude even though I had my receipt to show I wasnt lieing
5782,2,Poor 
28770,2,The employees are great but the store manager is just a nightmare We have coupons with the McDonalds app The store manager stated that she really hoped that they would stop honoring them because she was tired of having to ring then up My wife and I went to the restaurant today and she said the system was down and she would not accept them at all Im going to try and avoid this McDonalds in the near future
30408,2,Wait for my order over 10 minutes drive thru2 Deluxe with extra onions Fries where soggy Had to go back inside to get fresh fries Looked under staffed

28800,2,Good morning good morning the coffee was old the place is dirty I will not come back here again the people are nice but the place is dirty very dirty please clean up paint please cleanest McDonald though the bathroom was dirty the tables were dirty the outside was dirty have a great day
30370,2,It has been 20 min and im still sitting here as I am writing this waiting for my food And the employees seem too busy to acknowledge your presence half the time when you are trying to speak to them
28804,2,"Ive been going to this location most of my life since its not far from my home So Ive seen this McDonalds go through a lot of changes The employees here generally have decent attitudes there are a few that tend to be rude The store is also dirty a lot of the time Its a very busy location and maybe its from having a lot of foot traffic but the floor is usually dirty the drink station will be filthy and wet and sticky the ketchup area will be out of ketchup andor there will be ketchup all over the place too The tables tend to be dirty too you usually have to clean off your own table Also they have those light up tables that kids like and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting there and they wont be eating and theyll have their stuff all over the place and sit there for hours And mind you these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting there My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the lights and Ill have to tell him he cant because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest table is camping there The employees dont seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for hours but buying anything Sometimes theyll even be sleeping at the table
The kids play area is also really crappy They have nothing for the kids to play on like a playplace They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work properly or at all When I was a kid they had a huge playplace which they took out when they remodeled the store It even had N64s at one point along with the playplace But they took it all out and replaced it with a sitting place instead of a playplace Its really awful
So all in all this McDonalds is dirty has a lot of homeless people that practically live there and isnt really kid friendly The food is okay as long as its hot food I get a lot of cold food or my order is wrong and the employees are generally friendly but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather lackluster meaning that you can tell they dont want to be there This location needs a lot of work And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in there There hasnt been a single time Ive gone there that there wasnt at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit at with all their dirty things sitting on the table itself The table is by the front counter too and you can often times smell the homeless person thats sitting there the whole time youre waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your drinks It is not kid friendly at all at this store With the store being in a nicer part of town youd expect quite a bit more cleanliness"
30369,2,Past 2 recent visits my order has been incorrect and required remakes  They have a lot of employees and all are doing their own thing  Not an example of fast food
28814,2,Ive had good and bad experiences here Havent had ti
3935,2,Poor 
28883,2,Bummed The girl behind the counter was so helpful Pretty upsetting that ALL of the sandwiches in my order were wrong Yaymy fries were right
30331,2,The employees are nice location is always dirty Tables have to be clean more often The food quality has gotten better
3959,2,Poor 
30236,2,Dont know why but ever since the rebuild of this site the burgers are unbearable Never juicy dry and unfavorable as can be From the little burgers to the quarter pounder its the same Doesnt even taste like meat anymore They had the same problem with the nuggets at first but that got better after a few months but well over a year now and the burgers are just like eating flavored cardboard What happened
28938,2,The morning crew is professional to they are a stellar group  but the midnight shift is horrible food is cold desserts were squashed and when I showed them the muffins she saidthats how they came out
5615,2,Poor 
30224,2,You wouldnt expect it but its not as good as it is in europe not to mention if youll go there really hungry by the time theyll serve you youll starve
30213,2,The rep did not my order correct after I repeated it to him twice When I got to the pick up window I told the rep I was missing nuggets and she said I was not charged for it I told her that I would pay for it and said it was ok She then gave me a 10 piece nugget instead of 6 I dont know where she got those nuggets from but they were ice cold I felt so bad because my son bit into them and was so disappointed Although I was less than a minute away I refused to go back because I felt that was done spitefully  Usually go to this location at least 4 times but will NEVER return and encourage any one I know to skip this location
5606,2,Poor 
30209,2,Just went through the drive thru and literally was in line for about 20 mins start to finish For being a fast food they are super slow They are in the heart of Orland and do not do a good job My French fries were cold One of my kids drink was empty and the cookies I ordered were completely wrong I would suggest going to q near by restaurant which they have faster service than these people
5605,2,Poor

30312,2,Not Brother bringing food food to tablelong wait and don
30310,2,New system of ordering at kiosks is aweful Despite the most important thing to me being wanting to order with a human being ordering at the kiosk took longer and was more difficult than ordering with a humanand I wanted to pay cash which required I go to a cashier after ordering at the kiosk very frustrating Also the new fountain drink machines are equally aweful I will never order a drink from a machine that dispenses all drinks from one spout because no matter what you dispense it always tastes like a mix of more than one drink Why has McDonalds chosen to fix what wasnt broken and use systems and machines which customers so clearly dislike
28897,2,The food is ok The price is ok If you go through the drive through they always make you pull forward because your food isnt ready yet

3981,2,Poor 
30302,2,I would rate it a 1 star but people would not take my review seriously I visited this restaurant last night It was very clean including the bathroom At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their order The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the register This wasnt possible because nobody could pay at the kiosk they had to get a receipt and pay at the register I left 20 minutes later and went to Wendys when the line had barely moved
30301,2,Super slow to get food  It appears drive thru got all the attention  15 minutes to get food is too long  Also when I order a breakfast meal with a soda I want the choice to get a larger drink when they are all the same price
30296,2,Often very slow bc of the flood of people Thirty minute wait for fast food is crazy If you use the mobile app stick to drive thru I waited 30 minutes for curbside pick up and 25 minutes in lobby I recommend getting back in your car and going to ChickfilA Youll be there and back with your food before anything hap

So we sit around for a while I go and ask for ketchup cream and sugar  Get like 4 ketchup packs for 4 peoples orders  Ketchup poor I make my way back to my disappointed family and dole out one ketchup each

More waiting finally I go up with my table number and ask about the order  The same worker looks at me and says do you have a receipt My pocketversion of Kafka bursts into flames and I can only laugh at the absurdity  I finally get the attention of the manager who manages to pull my order from the void of the machine

Why two stars Because when the g

29956,2,Granted we at a busy time of the evening SeaWorld was getting ready to close but the lobby to thus McDonalds was locked even though all the signs clearly indicated they were supposed to be open for lobby hours The drivethru was open but it was exceedingly slow The service was poor and the products we ordered were subpar even for McDonalds standards which is saying something We ended up just throwing some of it away I typically do not leave negative reviews I am hoping that they were just shortstaffed the night we went

29931,2,We went in to order and sat down to eat because we had eaten in other restaurants on idrive We were told that we could not eat there but way we were told was very rude
29208,2,Slow and food was cold
29925,2,Could only order from kiosk Wanted some extras but serving staff struggled with English
29919,2,They took 17 minutes for my McChicken which feels like it wouldnt take that long and then they forgot my lettuce on it and the fries were cold Im wanting to bet that if I went again it would be better but with most options out of stock I cant recommend going
4625,2,Well ok
29225,2,Fun times
5356,2,Ordered mcnuggets with Hot Mustard sauce Gave me Honey mustard sauce And they flipping want 15 an hr Cant even get your order right
29227,2,Dirty and slow service
29230,2,Good iced tea
29910,2,Disappointing for the largest McDonalds Most menus items were unavailable when we came in Service is subpar Kids had fun in hame rooms
29906,2,They messed my order up 2 times They remade my sandwich and the chicken was still raw They have nasty attitudes You have to use the kiosk to place your order There is no more service with a smile An update I now have food poisoning form the raw undercooked chicken I was served yesterday Dont eat here I will never come back here ever again My reviews have been see by over 100500 people
29962,2,This is easily the worst McDonalds experience Ive had Waiting an hour for fast food in what can only be described as a dirty chaotic nightmare Staff are totally disorganised and management seems nonexistent Only getting 2 stars because when we eventually forced them to cook our food as we waited blocking the counter it was piping hot and pretty delicious
4635,2,Ok
4547,2,Scariest McDonalds Ive ever been to
29180,2,Long line at drive thru
4466,2,A place where you can eat  buy drugs at the same time lol Not even in Brooklyn
30014,2,Chicken nuggets were ice cold and disgusting the French fries it was like they poured 12 bucket of salt on them This is not the first time Ive encountered cold overly salted food
4481,2,Staff are bot too friendlythey seem annoyed wven
5425,2,Got two quarter pounders Both COLD So they do not make when ordered
4489,2,Tbh every McDonalds in the city feels like a portal to hell
4491,2,Food service okay needs cleaner bathrooms
30001,2,Every vehicle that ordered was told to move into a parking space to wait for their food Why not just allow everyone to wait at the window if service is so slow The other thing that set me off is they had a lady in her late 70s bring the food out She did so with a loving warm smile but I only hope they take care of her when the younger fit employees clock in No offense she was a sweet heart just worried
30000,2,This is my first time coming here and they made our order perfect then we ordered a waffle and we waited 1 hour for the waffle and the worker had the audacity to say do still want to wait for the waffle or a refund I said a refund and I was mad while walking out I don
4494,2,Order missing n not properly cook
29163,2,Very slow service today
4500,2,Small servings Not clean enough
4506,2,it is always crowded machines dont work
4514,2,Rude employees  there are always beggars
4519,2,Restrooms not available Unfriendly staff
4523,2,Bad food  rude staff
4541,2,Closed when is supposed to be 24 hours
28762,2,Unfortunately today while waiting in line pulled to the side not in the drive through lane my frappe was given to the person behind me She graciously didnt take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with it I waited 10 mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink back I was very confused by this especially in Covid times I requested a different drink no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be safe The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait again Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this 
5347,2,I love McDonalds But always something wrong with my order This time I didnt get a cheeseburger Only the bun with cheese
5337,2,There was a roach on the counter by the register The cashier and several other employees saw it They looked at me waiting for my reaction I will never eat there again since the last review stated there was a roach problem They obviously havent done anything about it  I will never eat there again And Im reporting them to the health department
4709,2,Come on Its McDonalds
4711,2,Typical
29834,2,2 adults ww children breakfast meals Had to go back to service counter 3 times no eggs in meal Then again hole in cup hot water everywhere Then tea bag had hole in so back to counter Food was cold by time we all sat down to eat No apologies were given
5292,2,I had to go around the drive through 3 times to get everything that I ordered Though people where usually very nice and apologetic
5291,2,Not very convenient if you just want to dine inside theres very little parking and difficult to get to other than that the food is the same
5290,2,First of all I cant understand why they had such a poor design with parking Parking is hard to get into and the shopping center has such a big parking lot Its such poor design Then they take a while for dinein Its faster if you order on the kiosk or app instead of waiting for them to take your order
29829,2,didnt give it 1 star because the food was good but around 4 days ago i went at night through the drive thru and I gave my McDonalds app code to get the points i ordered something that was 15 dollars in total and they charged me 31 dollars and the reason for this was that the guy that was taking care of the drive thru applied my McDonalds app code to another car order my card is linked to the app  and I ended up paying for their food i know this because they guy asked my name and when I told him he said something to the manager and I said yeah I think that car  is using my code  the guy just said  is your lucky day go to the next window   It was late at night so I didnt give it much thought because I didnt know just by giving your code you can get charged  but next day I got surprised when my account got charged twice Tried calling but they didnt solve my issue this is why I am leaving a review
5287,2,This might be one of my least enjoyable  McDonalds locations Food orders are wrong bad parking slow service entitled employees I would go out of my way to NOT go here
5284,2,"Everytime we go through the drive through here something gets missed  The caramel flavoring is missing from my latte today Fruit Fly is the OJ No syrup in the sprite Missing order items There is always something
I realize its a busy place but some attention to detail is needed"
4725,2,I wanted to get a McFlurry Unfortunately it was out of stock
5280,2,I ordered 2 milkshakes They just left one of them at their prep area almost 10 min After 15 minutes past I got one melted milkshake look like creamy milk that my kid refused to take it After left there I drove back and asked them to make a new one
4734,2,A very degraded place and the staff is not friendly
4738,2,The order was simply forgotten We only received it after asking
29271,2,Cold fries 
4742,2,Belowaverage Mcces especially in terms of cleanliness but also the friendliness of the staff You know that from Germany much more professional cleaner and above all friendlier I like McDonalds but we wont be going back here What was good there was enough space and on the upper floor you can also look
29262,2,Just okay
29893,2,Typical mcdonalds I guess The fries we tossed they were still frozen we watched them dump them in than scoop and fry them kinda gross Should of been tossed out entirely
5302,2,Very small McDonalds There is like 3 tables inside and 2 outside It gets crazy busy during lunchtime so expect your order to take a while or be messed up Also parking is limited
29838,2,It was a clean and convenient location but we were quite disappointed with the service and food we ordered  We clearly specified using the McDonalds app that we wanted a quarter pounder no mustard no pickles no onions  We received a fully loaded quarter pounder  AND when the lady delivered our app order to our car she intentionally stopped far enough so we had to reach backwards to get her food  She made no effort to offer the food  She made us get it where she was  McDonalds needs to review procedures with the staff and seek to improve the customer experience there
29875,2,Customer service needs some serious work MOBILE APP was the first words out the the drive thru cashiers mouth not even a Welcome to McDonalds And the Egg McMuffin bread was hard Not a good experience
5333,2,Will probably update with a coveted three star review after I go eat some after work dinner SpaghettiOs and am not pissed Apparently my kid and the employees both counted two less McDoubles than I paid for and guess guess what seriously four french fries instead of five They stole my fries just like the last time I ordered fries for myself So dad doesnt get his burgers or fries cool Or maybe I can drive a couple miles through rush hour traffic and complain about a location Ive always had problems at to a person who doesnt care Think pizza night needs to be more often No wonder all these big fast food places are going out of business in Clairemont
29874,2,"Dine In is NOT available I went with family but we had to sit outside This is the case observed in the evening in majority of outlets Placed pickup order and manager stepped out and addressed orders one by one
Burgers are served with ONLY bread and patty and NO vegetables"
29868,2,I ordered my food for pick up and when I walked into the restaurant it was cluttered with guests meandering about which I understood the behavior after MY 45 minute wait that was AFTER I waited 8 minutes to even be acknowledged by an employee So frustrating staffing seemed adequate just a lack of experience in prioritizing from the young manager
5332,2,"Yeah the food here is gross First and last time here The nuggets were brownnot golden brown BROWN The parfaits looked really unappealing Im thinking they were frozen and then sat in the sun and baked and then were put back in the fridge Gross

They had me park to wait for my order I stepped outside of my car to make a bottle for my baby The drive thru worker stuck her head out the window and yelled Your parfaits are ready

 Do you have feet You want me to walk"
4675,2,Slow service
29856,2,Ive never reviewed a fast food restaurant before because my expectations are never too high anyway Fathers Day drive thru at noon we were seriously in line for 25 mins This one has two separate planes to order The order taker was very slow coming to the speaker for all the vehicles when paying we were barely acknowledged but the worse was to come When at the next window to get our food the person did not even look at me literally just handed a bag out the window then handed the drink out the same waypartially angled down towards me Better yet check out the new crispy chicken deluxe 
29854,2,"This morning 10112022 went through the drive thru for my breakfast  Two things medium Hot mocha plain and sausage mcmuffin Paid and advanced to the next window  Here is where things went wrong
The blue shirt manager   last name begin with an A on duty Had a serious attitude  She did not acknowledge my order so she gave me the wrong order She gave me a bag with a sandwich and hash brown and walk away as if that was my order I sat there until she saw me and I told her I am waiting for my coffee  She said the there is no coffee on the order I showed her the receipt and she walk on to the coffee and gave to me Now I was going to let everything go until I heard her say these words after asking for napkin to wipe the chocolate OFF THE CUP  Which is her job 
Her Words loud and clear
FOR GOD SAKE
I know I only spent a few dollars but IT dont justify getting attitude because this is your job
I ask for a refund"
29852,2,Really nice McDonalds but the waiting is horrible no one is taken the in house orders only drive thru is being taken care of Ive been standing here for 27 minutes until I got to put in my order not a word said to me about the wait only 3 of the 8 desserts have labels Right next to me a customer brought up a buttermilk crispy chicken that got everything on it except for the chicken After receiving my order McDonalds employee I was telling waiting customers to use the touch screen One customer said she didnt know how to use it so she was told by the McDonalds employee to continue to wait I finally got my order after 39 minutes after coming in through the door
29851,2,The kids wanted it the kids loved it they had nuggets and friesits McDonaldsthe service at drive through is borderline passive aggressive  but you cant complain well its like say your order and heres your meallol but its McDonalds
5323,2,The only good thing McDonalds has is the Shamrock Shakes  If they ever stop making these I will never go back   I do wish they would put them back in the large drink cups  It seems the prices keep getting higher and the cups are getting smaller and smaller  Very sad
4693,2,nothing good
29842,2,Atmosphere is cool and unique Ordered pasta and cheesesteaks The wait time was forever service was definitely slow But it was also Easter and spring break weekend But what was odd was that we got our cheesesteaks and waited an extra 30 minutes for our fries and milkshakes That was weird and frustrating
29840,2,They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to navigate They are not very intuitive at all My order took three times as long to be brought out Good idea on the kiosks but very poor execution While I was waiting on my order they had to come and tell two different people that they were out of what they ordered fish sandwich and something else Store was newly renovated inside and out and looked very nice but I will not be back
4704,2,Poor
29837,2,Went through the drivethru and had a preorder They rushed us through they were busy then when we took a bite we found out that the Sandwiches were completely wrong Not even worth going back for Its happened multiple times at this location
6708,2,slow and bad service milk shake was like drinking milk poorly made
3841,2,Poor 
28755,2,Ok so I went and tried the new Spicy chicken nuggets I personally prefer the Wendys spicy nuggets they are much more tender and fresh tasting The McDonalds Spicy Nuggets were Spicy alone add on the Spicy sauce and they will make you sweat But mine were extremely dry and hard one had a weird rubber chewy piece so that was interesting I can say I tried them but I was not impressed
30884,2,Dawg hurry tf up mannn I
30877,2,Took forever about 10 mins in drive through No sense of urgency at all
3325,2,Too many drug addicts inside and in front
6434,2,There was like no ac The toilets were so gross The food was like normal McDonalds but it lacked a good atmosphere
6431,2,I had not been here in a long time but that night the rest room was the most disgusting thing I ever seen The food was descent even though I was working my Postmates
6428,2,This place was quite dirty and very noisy We tried to order some food for dine in and it kept asking us table number There is no number on any table When I ask the staff they said they will ignore that Very confusing
6437,2,Gave me the wrong burgers and seemed very dirty I did come again though and the food was correct and tasted like normal McDonald
6421,2,No electrical outlets for customers in a fairly large restaurant They also got my order wrongI ordered an egg and cheese biscuit and got chicken which at least is more expensive than what I ordered even if it wasnt what I wanted Hash browns overpriced They make it look like you get two on the kiosk graphic to trick you
28397,2,This is my third time visiting this store horrible place to eat all the 3 person at the service desk did not even eye contact with me and after food ready they just damp my order on the desk and I had to asked one gentleman if that was my order then he said  yes horrible place will not recommend it
6413,2,Too much loitering from homeless people
6409,2,I was just there this morning homeless people were in there sitting down the security guard on his radio and not paying attention to whats going on
6405,2,Loads of bums begging for food here and despite there being a security guard they allow it  But on the bright side they got my order correct and all
30858,2,2 stars for correct food but rude service smh
30857,2,The customer service is not really good  Need more Organized
28393,2,The only thing worse than the service was the food My wifes Big Mac tasted like it had been dropped in an ashtray
6438,2,Very slow for late night No communication with staff for efficiency At least one of the employees at register is willing to admit fault for delayed food
3312,2,Really long line for bathroom messed up order
6444,2,Place is overrun with vagrance and lowlives Steph isnt any better this slow angry and miserable
6482,2,Asked for sriracha sauce was confirmed that they had it Yet when we got to the hotel there was none in the bag Quite disappointed
3254,2,By far one of the worst locations in NYC  On separate occasions Ive gotten sick received cold fries and getting homeless people asking for money food
30933,2,Slow lazy staff At 6am there is hardly any business yet waited for a breakfast for 15min
30924,2,They are NOT open 24hrs despite what it says
30922,2,Orders senior coffee at the new kiosk and it charges you 050 more for using it Go directly to the cashier
3277,2,Staff inattentive gave me wrong food 3 times
6463,2,The two times i went there for lunch my fries where stale and there is a bunch or ppl from some rehab near by that sits in there and trys to sell stuff or arguing with each other  security is there but doesnt do a good enough job in my opinion
30908,2,One step slower in service they would go backwards By the time you get your food its already cold
3290,2,I go on my lunch break at 3 am and wait 15 minutes for them to get their stuff together
30905,2,Drive thru was so slow and no sauce given when asked and displayed on the screen
30899,2,Made a special request on my order I had to repeat it three times because a staff member ignored it
30897,2,No idea why they completely neglected the dining room trash cans overflowing trays of trash everywhere and all the condiments napkins etc empty
30890,2,Extremely slow Food wrong Did not feel like going back in to fix it
6446,2,Ordered something and got something else I asked not to include the bacon but they added the Canadian Bacon and served me
30887,2,Seriously the slowest mcd Ive ever been to
6401,2,We had breakfast here a couple of times Always tons of homeless people around One guys was dancing like crazy Pretty entertaining 
6397,2,Dirty place slow service
6394,2,missing part of kids meal plus less of  following covid19 precussion disorganized to that extent gives opportunity of 10 strangers to gather on order or pick up session
30850,2,Fast food is called such because you should get it fast completely unacceptable to wait almost 30 minutes for BREAKFAST
3458,2,Worst MC ever
6329,2,There was a constant beeping sound that none of the employees seem to care The tables were greasy with fries everywhere At least the food was made fast But I still recommend using another McDonalds
28441,2,Dirty unkind too long waiting time too high work load with minimum of employees
6317,2,Sad to say the only thing good r the workerswho work hard I only come for coffe but they serve u with a smile saddest part that this location Is filled with homeless people more homeless then customers sorry to saywill I come bk yes cause I enjoy the coffee befir church 
6316,2,Hello I  would have gave this McDonalds  a better review but They have a person or the store manager  on the floor  telling  people they have to sit and the back or leave these people are the homeless and IV drug usersFYI THEY PAYED FOR THEIR FOOD
3471,2,Horrible smelly overcrowded
3474,2,Dirty and bad food
3475,2,Dirty place
6302,2,This place is not very clean When I first walked in I heard yelling from a waitress saying 302 302 and there were many insects in this 
6295,2,For every good and helpful employee theres a bad and rude one to accompany them These employees seem to go out of their way to be as unhelpful and rude as possible And theyll regularly give you sauce packets that are sticky dirty and half destroyed Its honestly worth it to either go to the one in Penn Station or at 42nd street
30734,2,Computers were not working cash only a complete mess Cashiers do not know how to operate without them
3486,2,I plead the 5th
30711,2,Veryvery slow  Nice looking McDonalds but I wont go back to this one
30710,2,For the quality of food that McDonalds has it amazes me the cost of it
28456,2,Waited on line for 45 mins just to place the order
6336,2,Food was good but my boyfriend and I not feeling good and my boyfriend been throwing up ever since last night when we order our food never eating here again
3243,2,Very very busy Food quality was very low even for a McDonalds
3447,2,No surprises here  Its McDonalds
6350,2,No free refills on drinks much more expensive than other McDonalds The restaurant itself is in a sorry state of disrepair Broken seats tables with names carved into them grease splattered on the walls begs many questions about what goes on here Having recently eaten in other McDonalds all over the world this one has probably been the worst
6388,2,"its your typical McDonalds its clean besides the crumbs on the tables but thats typical

i didnt get any food just some coffee but it didnt taste right so i left it

restrooms were also filthy when i went"
28409,2,"Curbside is a joke
Waited for 15 mins should just go through the drive thru"
3364,2,Not to friendly there  use to be better
28413,2,Always a long wait today it took 35 min in drive through most times around 15 min but like their ice tea so but up with it
6381,2,They didnt have enough employees to take your order and they didnt have enough workers to make the food Horrible customer service they need to have more people working over there
30830,2,One of the largest McDonalds in the world as it is GINORMOUS The food is hit or miss though especially if you go through the drivethru
3383,2,Its a McDonalds with slow service Thats about the size of it
28421,2,Only gave me part of the food that I ordered them the manager gave me attitude they werent remorseful for messing up my order at all
28423,2,FOOD  WAS MEDIOCRE The service slow and unfriendly
30810,2,Service not what it should be Too slow  and the quality keeps dropping
3395,2,Bad service rude staff
30787,2,They were slow and unprepared unfortunately since this location is in a hotel district
6357,2,Just another place trying to automate to our detriment Ordered on machine  requested eat in  asked for a table ticket What the hell is a table ticket mashed in a number Received a to go order and my sandwich didnt have the lettuce  tomatoes removed as I requested Can we go back to the days of just ordering at the counter from a human being
6355,2,The employees cant tell the difference between Diet Coke and CocaCola worst of all I asked them for a second drink and they still got it wrong  But they did do my Big Mac good so that why I give 2 stars
3422,2,Mass production at its finest
30764,2,Inconsistent customer service Nothing really positive to report
28458,2,Horrible service Looked like they didn
6485,2,Waste of my monwy
3236,2,Went in for a spritehow can u have nasty sprite 2 wasted Probably one of the dirtiest McDonalds I have been to
6628,2,very dirty bathroom the place it self had a lot of homeless people hang out their 
6614,2,Typical Mickey D food Lots of homeless people I wouldnt want my kids exposed to that
6613,2,Unfriendly Employees including the manager The food did NOT taste right but stale A very WEIRD McDonalds
28285,2,Food was very good but quite a lot was missing from the order when we got home
6606,2,Very busy tables not cleaned  bathroom dirty  and doors not locking service was fast
6602,2,It was ok  Didnt like the fact they put garlic mayo on my chicken burger Didnt even know what a chicken legend was
28272,2,Having kiosks instead of human cashier really a bad idea not fan of it Taking my business to a different place were greetings  and thank you is the most important thing
3097,2,On McDonalds Ive ever been to that has a security guard Does not let you pee before you order Other than that the place is clean and fine
3098,2,Just bad service wasnt busy but the food took 1520 mins
6598,2,slow and its supposed to be a 24 hour spot  but they lock the doors with garbage bags
6596,2,Nasty to many homeless person inside
31082,2,Poor 
28296,2,Lets put it this wayyou better check your bag of food before leave They can barely understand English let alone get your order right 
28297,2,Food is always wrong
6600,2,Stopped over for a coffee The restrooms were locked and when the janitor did open them she was kind of rude
28271,2,Too long waiting lines to get a very bad customer service Food is ok
6638,2,Some woman that I dont know was in the bathroom dressed inappropriately and stayed in the bathroom the whole time since I didnt see her come out
3087,2,Its pretty much yhe same as most mcdonalds in the cityleast this one is kept clean only unpleasant sights are all the homeless dirtbags and all the drug addicts that hang around in front and beg for money indide just walk right up to people while their eating  ask for money beg for your foodother then that pretty good for a coty McDonalds
6704,2,Service was good but to many druggies hanging out
28232,2,It was terrible took forever Only giving 2 stars because the McMuffin was good
28235,2,I didnt get much sugar for my coffee all milk and day getting served my Burger not my Burger my sausage mcmuffin didnt give it to me in the morning They got me for some money not a pleasant place to go when you hungry you want your food

6685,2,Very slow staff not all when ordering Food is as expeteced at mcd
28241,2,Not to thrilled with this one anymore  used to love it when it was the world biggest McDonalds Now its like the others except for a few items on the menu  Plus they got rid of the life size Ronald McDonald
3066,2,They disabled the order kiosks by taking away all the number tents and requiring them Then i get in a line which is designed to handle the overflow not the whole store 2 cashiers and 25 people Nice long wait Then they didnt give my mcflurry a mix at all If i wanted a cup of vanilla ice cream with oreo topping i wouldnt have ordered a mcflurry
3067,2,The food was cold I couldnt sit in the restaurant to eat it and the service was slow Not to mention overpriced for what they gave me
28247,2,Burger was greasy and the fries tasted like the oil needed changed
3071,2,Restrooms werent available
6664,2,Its very dirty but at least the food is decent enough
31109,2,Poor 
28259,2,Food its okay however the customer service is terrible The few times I visited here the staff was rude and unprofessional
3077,2,A very busy McDonalds Whay under staffed One young man seemed to be doing all the work involving the food While they left a inexperienced young lad on the register She told me my daughter could not have a Dr Pepper cause it was not a drink choice for the cheeseburger meal This sounded absurd so when I asked her to explain this she told me no we are just out of it She was supper sweet and at this point I came to realize only her and the other young man were the only 2 working As the manager sat there holding a mop and did literally nothing for 20 min So many McDonalds in NYC and this one was in all Honesty just AWFUL
6591,2,Full of homeless people there were no napkins this was the worst mcdonalds Ive ever been
3113,2,The store is up to date very small and with exception of a few the staff sucks The few taking orders cool the people getting the food the worst Period
3116,2,Its ok  could be better i say its just to many homeless people dine un n have a bad smell  of sweat  n people get high in bathroom  n leave needle n bags of drugs on floor dirty at time smell homeless people  askin for money harass people who eat in McDonalds
3118,2,We had to ask for our order because people before us were getting served and there were employees in the back cursing and being loud with each other Very uncomfortable experience
31034,2,Poor 
31014,2,Poor 
28347,2,Ordered 2 double fish fillet sandwiches and got 1 double and 1 single Order must be checked and double checked for Togo Im not coming back to change the order after few miles
31001,2,Poor 
3191,2,Too long of wait order kioskmuffin and coffeewaited more than 20 minutes
30983,2,Poor 
30978,2,Poor 
3210,2,The place was dirty the staff was not overly friendly and quite a few of McDonalds standard products were not available
3211,2,Its a McDonaldsBut theres a bad homeless problem in and around this place  Most times youll be asked for money by people hanging around this location
28355,2,They messed up the order after explaining a few times of what we wanted and had hair in both of my egg McMuffins
3226,2,Staffs were friendly Lunch time gets crowded and might make mistakes in your order
3230,2,My breakfast sandwich bread was so burnt it was inedible
28358,2,The good thing is that is open 24 They do not have enough personnel Food was just okay help us survive till the next morning
6490,2,Not my kind of place besides I stopped eating all red meat unless its organic or grassfed beef
28365,2,Standard food Fast service Cash only at night More expensive than other McDs
6513,2,Bad service cold food I didnt get my complete order and had guide the staff multiple times to complete the order
6488,2,Do you really need to be reading a review of McDonalds Customer service and McFlurry availability is hit or miss but the food is the same as any other McDonalds anywhere in the US except that one that still has pizza
28339,2,Usally the location I visit is on the money both with over allservice and cleanses how ever this particular day the place was a total mess and service was horrible when it should not have been because it wasnt busy
3159,2,Its gotten a little better But i think it might be time to change the managers And definitely renovate
31072,2,Poor 
3122,2,The service at the counter was nice But theres an old man that acts like the 2nd floor VIP bouncer was very aggressive and offputting
3124,2,Waited 30 minutes for food did got any real apologize
3125,2,Filthy location garbage on the seating and tables with grease and mold on floor corners  we walked out because I cant image how it looks like in the kitchen  food preparation area
6567,2,Customer service isnt the best And dont attempt the 24 hours route Theyll have you waiting but standing at the window
3127,2,Over crowed security want u to stand where there is no space never enough workers the attitudes from the guy in the blue uniform horrible no manners a whole jerk I come everyday spending 28 drinks done b4 food why the doorman is the greatest
31066,2,Poor 
6553,2,Doesnt open 24hrs Tables gotta get cleaned but employees just spend time chatting
3134,2,Food is often cold No matter what burger you order it comes made wrong I only go here to get chicken nuggets or a mcflurry
6550,2,The women bathroom doors didnt close  and they were for dirty  There were long lines to order food that was unorganized and crowded
6548,2,Food was fine but the homeless nearly started a brawl in the dining room
6540,2,The food was not hot plus staff  need to talk to customers  better 
28319,2,They can not get any order right My order took 3 remakes and finally I had to go in to the restaurant after placing my original order in the drive thru
31037,2,Poor 
28324,2,I dont understand because mc Donald is a fast food place and I go thru the drive thru and  the tell me that I have to wait in one of the parking spots in stead of grab and like any normal fast food
28333,2,Slow service got orders wrong but still kept people waiting while rest of their food went cold worst mc donalds Ive been to for service
6276,2,They botched an order Ordered spicy chicken sandwich and they gave me a dry one no condiment Compete with ChickfilA Yeah right cant even compete against popeyes
3501,2,Dirty and dirty people
30708,2,Waited at the table for an egg McMuffin meal for 15 min  It must be quicker if you order to go  Sucks
3718,2,Does not represent company values
3725,2,Slow and not longwinded
6003,2,Small crowded with inefficient system with limited seating Messed up a simple order Had to wait to get napkins and ketchup since its at front counter only
3731,2,Poor 
30509,2,Slow service and attendents dont acknowledge customersI ate there multiple times since it was close to where I was saying and could get a quick bite to eat but it was slow
5997,2,System always seems to be down frequently Only accepts cash when their wifi is out
6016,2,If its busy you will wait ages Poor food at high prices Plenty of better places to eat nearby
5996,2,Food is not as great as it used to Fries too bland Burgers taste dry Only giving it 2 stars because of their happy meal toys
28631,2,The service in every Mcdonalds is doing worst with the time
30503,2,In almost all McDonalds I have been going have self order post The bad news is when the machine freezes up you have to go at front and ask for help right No help you need to l look ace the order again
30501,2,Took an hour and a half to get food but friendly staff
5965,2,This place is more of a homeless shelter than a fast food restaurant There is an upstairs seating area which apparently only opens when the employees deem necessary There is literally nowhere to sit here Take out only
30492,2,Got nuggets and fries Asked for barbeque and ketchup for the fries Got no barbeque or ketchup good thing we went to the big mcdonalds enjoying dry nuggets now At least the food was hot
5959,2,"Ive worked in the neighborhood for decades and this was always a decent go to place for a late night snack

A couple of years ago they modified the interior they removed a lot of seats on the main floor in order to install electronic order kiosks  There are now only a handful of places to sit in a ridiculously cramped manner  Late at night they close the upstairs leaving pretty much nowhere decent to sit and eat  Tonight I saw two people eating over the garbage cans and one eating by the soda dispenser

The kiosks are annoying  They ask if you want to take out or eat there  If you select Eat In before you can pay for your order youre asked to get a table marker and enter the marker number  Thing is there are absolutely no table markers you cannot complete your order without one unless you start over and select take out

During the day perhaps eating in makes sense but late at night its really only for take out"
30508,2,Fries were very cold childrens burgers were creased as if once wrapped they were smashed with something service wasnt terrible but food put out was
3715,2,Lousy service
6021,2,Its just convenient and cheap if you on the run
30523,2,They cant handle a lot of customer Waited 10 minutes for my order outside
6064,2,Obviously food is the same everywhere however this restaurant has a loitering problem from some of the local homeless The toilets in this one was also quite dirty
28584,2,Forgets food often longer wait time than some coasters in town Ran out of diet coke
28590,2,Food was the same but this was a half hour wait for food Clearly this franchise was not up for a noon rush hour
6056,2,Needs more security Fight almost broke out between a homeless man and a patron
30560,2,All self ordering machines food took forever to come out drink machine didnt work
30553,2,Was under staffed long wait order was gotten wrong
30548,2,Service was very slow Managers did not work with urgency to get orders out on time while people waited 20 minutes for their orders
6044,2,Extremely slow due to the lack of staff expensive compare to those around the city Dont recommend
30543,2,THE SLOWEST AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE Definitely not coming back
6040,2,Food order took over 20 mins Nuggets were dried out and old To top it all all no sauce or ketchup given They did refill my drink because I waited so long
3707,2,It does not have a drink refill
6032,2,atendant was very nasty to me all because i asked her if they had ice i though there machine was brokenbecause dhe was asking another customer was the soda cold enuffso i asked if they had ice and she replied very nasty
6031,2,No seats in any of the floors Too many people sleeping over the tables I just wanted to eat in peace
28608,2,They were extremely slow
30526,2,So they can ring you up at the counter but you have to order through those machines Ugh Place smells like disinfectant and bleach charges tourist prices
5958,2,No tissues what so ever not cleanlot of tourists from chinatown tour travel It is simply shame on McDonalds to do these 3rd class servicesconfused and disconnected staff Felt like there was only one person working who looked like a team leaderall employees making team leader workpity on him
3755,2,month
5954,2,The service is slow 6040 if the food taste good And anything more then the 123 dollar menu the taste aint worth the price I think being extremely slow is a all McDonalds requirement tho
5953,2,I am not that pleased with McD The ice cream is nice What I dont like about a lot fast food places is that the ongoing clean up process is sometimes flat out disgusting Who wants the crumbs from the table next to you in your food or getting dirty mop water inside your shoes because they are mopping under the same table your trying to finish your meal
5869,2,I came in at 1030 on a Sunday and no dam breakfastreally The only thing I want at 1030 in the morning on a Sunday is an egg mc muffin They had no pancakes I only drink coffee and have breakfast at McDonalds and they didnt have acceptable breakfast products
5864,2,It was a little packed but cleared out quickly the upstairs was not crowded at all very surprised My gripe is that my server preparing my coffee dropped my lid on the floor and lookroceeded to place it on the coffee and hand it to me So I kindly but firmly asked  Didnt you just dropped that on the floor She gave a look like Oh I did walked over to the garbage  dumped it I should hve called the manager but she gave me no problem Just wondering if she has a habit with other items dropping  giving it to customers
3809,2,Poor 
3817,2,Poor 
5844,2,"I was told that I had to buy something in order for my young child to use the restroom

Not a problem but please speak to your customers with some level of respect Not yelling or sounding extremely annoyed"
28725,2,Cold fries Double cheeseburgers were not hot and the cheese wasnt melted  The mms were dumped on the top of the mcflurry and some spilt out  18 is expensive for my meal and a happy meal for my daughter Then subpar at best
30425,2,Quite literally one of the worst McDonalds ever Staff is incompetent unfriendly and doesnt get the order right or the food is OLD As the manager of a 1500 room resort I advise all of my guests to detour this location
28730,2,Bad service that dont give me what you order
5828,2,Staff were extremely rude Yelling at us to order at the kiosk even though we told them we only had cash
3832,2,Poor 
5813,2,Staff is extremely rude and unprofessional Except for the young 19 year old woman at the register that got the toy I specifically asked for She was very kind The other two a young man and a lady that seemed like the manager had a nasty attitude and the manager spoke to the helpful cashier very rudely
5807,2,Poor 
28753,2,Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this McD I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate service I am not sure if its because my car is quiet or what but its mildly annoying Never has my sauce order been correct Never Even when I pay for it Even when I ask and confirm at the window Its awkward confirming sauce and then having to ask for the exact sauce you were just promised was in the bag
5801,2,Poor 
30421,2,Only two power outlets in the whole place and the best one is at the employees table Noisy and confused environment Not for business people Has a 60 minute time limit on  Internet
5875,2,Poor quality and mediocre service
30563,2,No vegeterian options
5879,2,Lots of homeless dirty bathroom with long line
30458,2,Beautiful establishment both inside and out but the soda dispensers werent working and waiting in line to get drinks and ketchup sucks when other customers are placing orders and facing the same dilemma
3759,2,Poor 
5947,2,The automated machine didnt print us a receipt so I told one of the employees who was nice enough to look up the number  The problem was I had no reference to chek the order  I spent almost 50 dollars for 3 kids and 2 adults  I walked 5 blocks to get that food bbn order and when I got back to our job I discovered we were missing chicken nuggets and all the dipping sauces  I ordered 6 sauces and we got none  It really pisses me off because they always leave stuff out when we order large orders  Its like they can only handle it if u have a simple meal  Its so frustrating and plus its like throwing 10oo out the window  you really need to be better about training your workers
28664,2,When you are starving and nothing else in sight for the pocket change you have well thats why i go to McDonalds
5943,2,this location has 3 floors but usually only 2 are accessible to customers wouldnt recommend eating here and strongly suggest taking your order to go as the crowds of tourists and locals make it hard to find a seat
5941,2,Stopped here to get a quick bite the place looks very dirty Homeless people in the entrance and inside The 2nd floor smelled like piss Just go here if you want to go to the bathroom or are really really hungry
3767,2,Rubbish
5929,2,Update its so frustrating to eat here There is a virtual army of panhandlers from the nice guy who opens the door for you to the more aggressive ones that approach you as you order or eat your food In addition the place is still disorganized and dirty  Thats McDonalds in New York  Management at this location is pretty lame
28676,2,Had a weird terrible unusual experience Went tonight about 820pm Only 2 cars in front of me Ordered using my mobile app which I love it Ordered a mc chicken and guess what It came with NO CHICkEN And enough mayo to make two more Enjoy the picture
3768,2,soft drink without gas
5919,2,The food  service is excellent  if you are taking the food out its great However if you plan to stay  eat inside there are many homeless people inside  the odors from the bathrooms dies not make it pleasant Must clean up the odors inside if they want me back
28689,2,They need more happy people in there and people to actually Acknowledge there guest and smile  Its horrible to feel like your a bother as a customer when your spending your hard earned working money at your restaurant  NOT GOOD for the business at all especially when your a regular  This needs attention Immediately to earn the peoples business
5905,2,The food was fresh and hot The service was quick and the restaurant was clean  Maybe its McDonalds policy but why do you have to ask for ketchup salt and pepper And then theres none of that in the seating area either I go upstairs find a seat take my food out of the bag and no condiments To get some Id have to pack my food up and go back downstairs for some frickin ketchup No other fast food place is like that
30464,2,Sloooooow service 100 PM and just got a cheeseburger  small fries from drivethru because I was late for a meeting Took 15 minutes for this simple order Reallyfor a burger  fries
30461,2,The nuggets from this location were the WORST Ive ever had Unfortunately I didnt taste them until Id gotten back to my room otherwise Id definitely have asked for my money back
5891,2,I honestly only went for a large French fry and to use the restroom Very clean great janitor Pay her more
5888,2,"Cold burger without the customize order served 7 minutes after Ive got the melting sundae
Dirty mess upstairs"
6067,2,Always super pack Not worth the wait if you do come here They also had my breakfast mc muffin burnt I dont know what else I can say
6071,2,Expensive crowded and slow service The worst combo for a FAST food place
28575,2,I tried to buy a burger for a homeless lady and the manager told me no She then approached the homeless lady and told her to leave
28484,2,Waited 30 minutes in drive thru line be told they are out of fish and chicken
3569,2,Long lines
6239,2,It was dirty homeless people hanging out inside asking for moneyI offered a person 5 to buy a meal and was insultedI guess money was for Drugs or beer
28485,2,"I was there to separate times one time I paid over 2 more than the second
time and got the exact same thing"
6231,2,There is a hired male guard for the bathrooms to ensure only paying customers use it which seems overkill and made me as a customer uncomfortable The technology of coded locks satisfy this need for other businesses in the area Bigger concern is that a guarded bathroom was still incredibly filthy If youre paying someone to hang around the bathroom all day maybe also pay someone to hang around the bathroom and clean it There was a copious amount of a vomit like substance trailing out of one of the stalls that had been there for some time and one of the two stalls didnt lock Not cool
6227,2,"Its a McDonalds If you want youve eaten at one youve eaten at them all

However this review is based solely on the location 8th Avenue has a SERIOUS homeless problem and the restaurant is always swarmed with them If it were just that they were begging for change I could forgive it Unfortunately most of the people Ive seen are out of their minds on whatever drugs and usually screaming and carrying on They make me incredibly uneasy to the point where Im not comfortable eating here anymore More than once Ive seen fights break out Best to find another location"
6225,2,Dirty sticky tables and floors Crowded Expect to wait a while for food ordered at kiosk and at the cashier No table service here Dark space Lots of transients though the guards do a good job of making sure people buy stuff
6220,2,Security was rude Has an emergency to use Restroom He said No unless u purchase something  I explained I would get a coffee but I an Urgent need to twinkle  He state not my problem I purchased a coffee Will Never patronize this business
6213,2,"McDonalds is fast food not because its good but a quick cup of coffee ok
Dont expect much as far as food The
worst thing really is the ordering and waiting to get what you ordered Worse McDonalds is 8th Ave 35st Very bad staff I asked for a straw I had dropped mine no no no I said Ill pay for it never got the straw lol You will live eating the food get ready for
cold food And nevermind an extra anything Shame it was not bad but now"
3577,2,Very expensive and super bad service The place was clean
3581,2,The food was good the speed of the order to withdraw online was fine but it was 825 a McDonalds worker came in and told us in a very bad way that we had 5 minutes to finish eating and we had just started eating
6208,2,"This review is in 2 parts 1st the dining area and bathroom and 2nd the behind the counter crew and food
1stthis Mc Donalds seemed to have their own guidlines for COVID19 And the guidlines they followed were NONE or ZERO The place was VERY crowdedNO social distancing NO one to monitor or count how many people were allowed in it  did not feel or look clean or a safe environment good to  spread germs and viruses
alot of people from the street who were not customers just hanging around using many tables and  shoulder to shoulder in the seats people passed out in the chairs with masks pulled off They had ONE dining room person who just could not keep up with the mess that they were leaving The bathroom was a horror show obviously people were washing and cleaning more than just their hands inside was dirty
2ndthe saving grace of the restaurant was the cashier the food expediter and the employees making the food they were all very fast pleasant thanked me and the food was hot fresh and very good

Dining area and bathroom 0 zero stars

Behind the counter employees and food 4 stars

Combined and average  2 stars"
6202,2,They need to keep the restaurant cleantables are dirtychairsare equally dirtyyou homeless people walk in there bugging us customers
6194,2,"The staff who work there have no manners whatsoever I go there everyday on my break and when its time to pickup my order its just a here you go
Im always polite and always say thank you even though no one ever says anything back
At this point Id rather talk to a robot than anyone who works there
Id probably get better service"
6190,2,Chances of being stuck by a hypodermic needle are pretty high at this location  Restaurant is full with people you really wouldnt feel comfortable eating next too
28482,2,Weird credit card layout tea was hot 34 of a cup filled up and bland would skip this McDonald
6188,2,To crowded and not safe with homeless and drug addicts hanging out inside The good was not the same as other establishments Very disappointing with good and service Last time going there
6244,2,Ok for quick pick ups Not the best place to go for a semi decent eating The place was crowded the crowd a bit rough around the collar and the staff appeared rushed Have head better service same venue different later in the day
28479,2,"Food was cold
Service could of been better"
28459,2,Stay away from this McDonalds seriously Worst service I
6265,2,"This McDonalds restaurant was Ok Neither more or less compared to my expectations However I find it on a negative side note the constant stream of homeless people entering the restaurant causing somewhat of a commotion

The service and the employees of the restaurant was helpful and fine"
30688,2,The  manager is not professional  If you want to eat in the restaurant you must do it outside in the heat you cannot eat inside the restaurant
6263,2,Very dirty place
3524,2,Mc
6260,2,"Extremely busy when we visited at lunchtime with queues at most of the automated order points and hardly anywhere to sit once we had received our food  which was good  from the rather harassed looking staff

Despite there being a clearly signposted No Loitering policy with a maximum 30 minutes to eat your meal this did not seem to apply to the rather insalubrious clientele who were occupying most of the seats in the back part of the place I hesitate to use the word restaurant to describe this outlet

As it is almost opposite the Tick Tock Diner which was really busy at breakfast time we had planned to try this McDonalds for breakfast but after todays experience well give it a skip"
30687,2,Food is typical for McDonalds I decided to eat in but alarms were loud and constant the entire time I was there Several people working and ignoring the various buzzers and chimes This will keep me from returning
3526,2,Very expensive
6257,2,I had to give 2 star because Ive been trying to call the phone number listed on the website multiple times and no one responded or go to voice mail with Verizon I had few missing items that I wanted to report The food came fast but I have had better food from McDonalds than from this location
30683,2,Short of help and check your bag for accuracy
30674,2,Customer service was just poor and uninviting Didnt really eat since just getting a drink but for a place next to hospitality centric services I was surprised
30653,2,Trash cans outside were over filled and garbage was all over the floor At least the fries were hot
30652,2,No ice cream machines again Always broken and right next to many hot theme parks where people want ice cream with lunch
28476,2,The people working here are not friendly  Went through the drive through and the only only thing said to me was my total
28478,2,Somehow they forgot to give us our orderno big deal I needed the exercise and they did apologize
30651,2,My Nuggets Came Back Covered In Mustard When I Said I wanted mayonais the manaigs they tried giving me was disguting when i ate it and trhen the mustard got on my arm
28756,2,food is typically put together well however curbside is a minimum of 20 minutes once you pull up Then hopefully you can get a curbside spot because the spots are usually full of customers theyve had pull forward and park to wait for their food might as well go through the drive thru
28510,2,Drive thru takes forever and orders are never right the inside with the new send order plus counter orders its mobbed and confusing
6172,2,To many homelessness are in this franchise it is quite disgusting
28545,2,The food was hot Im just not a fan of McDonalds but two children enjoyed it
6115,2,This place is right next to New York penn station so expect a crowd and a long wait use the kios its must faster The customers there tend to be loud and uninviting
28547,2,Closed early and drive thru takes forever
28548,2,Need to update breakfast app menu and add back the souther style chicken biscuit
28556,2,It smell and it was dirty The worker were very pleasant
30580,2,Sucked biscuits were old and hard not going back
28560,2,They forgot the top bun on one sandwich Everything else wasnt much better Thrown together and awful
3664,2,One of the worst Ive been to pretty dirty
30573,2,Came for dine in service apparently last one of the night since I got locked in food was you know McDonalds the terrible management is quite apparent at this place if there is another option do not come here
6094,2,Fast and friendly service but absolutely filthy No clean tables or chairs in the open areas Bags food and everything else under the sun on the floors Floors sticky Food in bathroom sinks Only here because it
6084,2,One of the ladies was very rude to three other customers I get it Ive worked those types of jobs and I understand its not easy to be in a good mood dealing with so many customers all day often the same problem many times and I get people have mood swings but this was more than just rude it was confrontational Not gonna give one star because she was
28569,2,Took too long to complete order dirty floor overall impression of a badly run McDonalds  a rarity
3671,2,I cant eat here anymore I dont like the food
6081,2,Two stars are given to the star Carla who made our visit experience acceptable due to her helpful behaviour and lovely personality Food was good but the place is not recommended for anybody especially tourists because it is alway
28574,2,Service slow food cold and dry Had to queue back up to get a cup
6121,2,Its a place to run in  grab something quick to eat  As far as sitting in there its not ok the ppl they allow in there are mostly homeless
6180,2,A lot was out of stock and staff attitude is horrendously bad
6124,2,I took my children and their friends here for a treat after shopping We used ordering kioskfood was promptly given to us When we found seating it was right next to the McDonalds security Security cursed up a storm around my children with great vulgarity
6127,2,Dont think i would go here on my own a lot of vagrants about Not very clean food was ok
30623,2,The food was correct and warm but 30 minutes in the drive through was not expected
6171,2,"Looked like it could have done with some more staff

Dude handing out the food just marked random ones as gone even though he didnt announce the numbers

We had to go ask for ours It was just chilling there

But its McDonalds If youre going youre going to go regardless of the rating"
28518,2,Might be I expect more from it But in comparison to the EU McDonalds the food is poor Drive through is a nightmare
3607,2,The truth is that in the USA in Queens they dont even let you sit in a drive tru its very ugly
3608,2,You get your food stowed in a bag as standard whether you want to eat in or take it with you Sauce on the Mc fish fillet also oilier than normal Furthermore this Mc on 34th street was dingy
30615,2,Prices high and mcgriddle sandwich fit in palm of hand Not worth money
6155,2,This is one of the busiest stores in the city You get everything here Definitely not a good place to dine in Lots of tourists and people constantly asking for money inside the restaurant Avoid if possible
6150,2,The food was ok but I have experienced better service They missed things The tables were in bad condition and the floor was not cleaned since ages
6149,2,McDonalds seems to be the meeting place for homeless and mentally ill people in NYC I dont know why 
6146,2,There are better McDonalds places than this
28526,2,Slow  Havent tried the food yet since I am min minute 32 of waiting for my FAST food
3627,2,Just like everywhere else but in the USA with a very different audience curious
30603,2,Adopting the kiosks eliminated any chance for interaction with a person The lack of counter and lobby staff makes for a customers helping customers  Several people gave up on kiosks and left Expecting robots in the kitchen next time   The lobby and bathrooms are clean
6131,2,The place is a mess and they didnt have breakfast They expect people to eat a McDouble with orange juice at 5 am
3640,2,Bad attention The cashier making a face and super rude Other than that there is no refill
28538,2,Sooo slow and got my order completely wrong Didnt seem to care
1437,2,Poor 
5026,2,Poor 
113,2,We went through the drivethrough and ordered 2 baconcheese burgers and 2 big Macs and we asked for them to leave the middle part the bread in the center We got the baconcheese burgers and they were fine But the big Macs not only still had the bread in the center but had another piece of bread on the bottom with macsause on them So instead of 2 pieces of meat and 2 pieces of bread I ended with 2 pieces of meat and 4 pieces of bread I was not amused when I got home You can bet that I will NOT EVER stop there again
25803,2,"THE FOOD WAS OK
THE CUSTOMER SEVICE WAS EXTREMELY OFF POINT RUDE CASHIER N MANAGER"
198,2,Completely ignored me when I was waiting for them to take my order at the register
33234,2,To get out of the way it goes well but the attention is unfriendly dirty bathrooms Average food to a MCD
32724,2,Is not my first time going there but today food was cold
485,2,So Really slow
26653,2,My experience was ok They forgot little things in my order like a straw for iced tea and cream and sugar that i requested  The wifi is not available like they stated when searching for wifi there is no mcdonals wifi instead it was a wired name like EBOS The connection did not allow for simple web browsing  For a Mcdonalds thats near universal studios This place is ok
9276,2,They were fast but my fries and sandwich were cold
813,2,"Curbside is unavailable for all hours
McDonalds app freezes in order screen frequently at this particular locationI have great service with ATt and new phones so I dont think its on my end
I have had multiple issues with old orders trying to reprocess old orderss here  leading to wrong food being ready at the window staff more interested in proving to me that what came through from the app was what they prepared 4 chicken nuggets for three people Is not adequate They did not offer to even take a new order I left with NO food"
33320,2,Bad service and bad taste Wouldnt go back there
25796,2,Very hot in the play area and it also smells like its never cleaned
33230,2,I dont like it very much the breads are not like the ones we used to eat at McDonalds also almost all of them only speak English and sometimes its hard to communicate
26069,2,1115 at night and sitting in mine for 30 minutes and the line hasn
25795,2,Did not make my coffee right Tasted like water
359,2,Fries were stale and customer service was poor
10322,2,Gave me the wrong cafe latte
26193,2,Food was ok for Mickey Ds But the basket was horrible Didnt care Didnt even wanna be there Didnt want my business
178,2,Does anyone ever expect to go there for the awesome food and beyond superior customer service Nope Its the only place with a decent sausage biscuit without having to drive to Carl JRs in cedar park
33215,2,Its McDonalds
33002,2,Not fast
25784,2,Hispanic young skinny girl Shes at the cash register and her attitude stinks 
32549,2,To go order without napkins no sauces asked BBQ for the nuggets Diet Coke was a mix of flavors
25785,2,McChicken always calm my hungry momentums
25786,2,Their ordering speakers both dont work waited like 20 min
806,2,"Brodheadsville Pa

9089,2,because the sausage mcmuffin is reasonably priced and it confuses me when ask for one I always get the overpriced awful one
177,2,Not a big deal but the guy at the window on drive through said there were more then 3 NBA sauces in the bag I said ok and went home Got home and there was nothing in the bag Just double check everything even of they say it there Probably wont go back to that location again

33025,2,Bad service
26434,2,At first I felt hungry so I went to this very fancy Mickey Ds  But then while getting back home  which was a long way from the Santa Monica Pier  I felt nostalgic and my stomach was hurting really bad  So I had to stop at Carls Jr on  Newhall for the bathroom

10339,2,Did the self order through the kiosk to avoid the line and still waited almost 30min for my food due to them having given out my order to someone else the first time
26080,2,Out of cups  wouldnt give a side of sauce through the drive thru stopped listening half way through my order
9272,2,The food was cold and not what I ordered I did drive thru
26742,2,The drive through at this McDonalds has always been busy every time Ive gone  Its honestly worth driving a little extra to another location if you are in a hurry  Ive been stuck in the drive thru line for over 15 minutes on several occasions just ordering a single cheeseburger  Granted compared to In and Out thats nothing but this is McDonalds  That aside the interior has always been pretty clean when Ive went inside  If you go for breakfast on the weekends once again be prepared to wait  They do take Apple Pay and Android pay  The one time I used it the person behind the counter actually knew what it was  So many places tell you they dont have it but just dont know what it is  Another big plus is the drive through is 24 hours
32810,2,The claim they close at 3am on Saturdays
200,2,Kiosk is a joke Takes longer using it than just ordering at the counter Young lady behind the counter obviously did not want to be at work She wasn

1261,2,Uggg
968,2,If theres more than 2 cars in drive thru line keep driving unless you like overcooked hollow French fries
26213,2,Saw the manager come out the back picking his nose straight up digging for gold in that thing then start serving people with no gloves CmonSon
9330,2,I only go here for breakfast I dont like there regular menu items
116,2,Always busy sort of slow but not too slow Dangerous intersection when leaving the drive thru The food the couple of times I have been here seemed old or dry it wasnt bad just not very good
828,2,10 for breakfast Never again Ill make my own at home Ordered 2 Sausage McMuffin with egg 2 hash browns small coffee Requested 2 creamers and 6 sugars on the side What I get Cream and sugar already mixed in Guess they dont pay attention to what theyre hearing over the headsets

32749,2,Literally sit in the drive thru line at 3am for over an hour horrible
9642,2,Ultimately I threw up so
26411,2,Food was not hot fries to salty
10031,2,"This is my first ever 2 star review
I stopped in for a quick bit or so I thought I had no issue with the food or the face that there was a wait What I had an issue with was the one male working the counter was more interested in flirting with the girl with pink hair working the fry machine that he had customers waiting for him to stop talking to her just to get them items he left off their order At one time I was able to finally get the pink haired girls attention and I told her I was missing a coke She told him and he went on flirting I finally got his attention and told him I still needed my coke and he turned around and asked someone else to get it and went right back to his flirting I do not think that his actions or lack there of reflects the overall workers at this location but at the end of the day his actions are reflected in the review ratings that myself and others have given The food is great certain staff at this location not so much"
26226,2,Thru the years I have seen how the people working in this particular mcDonalds changed for the worse
32525,2,Ordered 2  kiddy meals and juices were left out and they forgot the apples Horrible service Never again here
26758,2,My brother and I tolerate it because its close to us and its open when no one else is  But  you get the loonies showing up there Homeless wandering in and out filling up for free their gutter cups at the soda machine Smells psych ward cryouts and who knows what else are the norm so do yourself a favor and order by the drive through and get the hell out quick
958,2,The food handlers were picking up the plastic bag of shack mix with gloves off of the FLOOR on then going back to food handling Youve got to be kidding me What are you wearing gloves for
25963,2,the slowest mc Donalds in the world  It is supposed to be 24 hours but they leave it closed to customers and by car mac it takes 15 minutes per customer  I mean I wasted 1h of my life waiting for such a bad and slow service
26525,2,This is the slowest McDonalds Ive ever experienced  The staff is difficult to deal with and 5 out of 5 times our order is wrong Great location and clean facilities though
32988,2,The wait was crazy slow
10032,2,Busy loud dirty disgusting The food was mediocre at best the restaurant was filthy employees were over stressed and understaffed so I really couldnt communicate with them I had an issue with a deal on the app and was not being allowed to use it appropriately but ended up having to pay a higher price anyway because I couldnt relate my issue to the manager without stalling line and making people wait longer
25960,2,Bad costomer service slow workers
593,2,Poor 
9338,2,Bad service cold food Never go there
33359,2,This rains on the wet very bad attention and they take too long
26759,2,bad night went for a burger got trapped in the drive thru took almost ten min to get to the order screen only to find out their grill was down and they arent cooking meat just nuggets trapped for another ten minutes for a total of almost twenty minutes with nothing to show for it things happen just put a damn sign up
33358,2,no power the cardboard straws
10297,2,"Worse designed for cistomers the confusion of where to stand no order or pick up area counters too hi in ice cream area tables are
badly placed just looks messy with all bells  beeps going off all day annoying to customers  nerve wracking for wrks
improved equipment is to be
updated"
1293,2,Horrible fries
25956,2,Homeless people walking on  the restaurant asking for money Employees ignore it
386,2,Food is gross but its cheap
120,2,Id only eat from here if there is no other option Its on a good location since its kinda on my way from work to home I finish work at 12am so i have literally no other option cause i am exhausted and not willing to drive further Burgers are dry patties are old i got 4 nuggets instead of 6 In short dont waste your money cook yourself at home

987,2,They charge more there than my local Mc Din Windgap 60 cents more for a large Mocha Frappie in Brodheadsville never again
26064,2,Medium coffee is almost 2 dollars and it
33336,2,"Good evening Completely disorganized staff speaking very loudly in Haitian Creole
The wait was very long"
33335,2,I went at 5am on Sunday and it was closed A lie
9301,2,About what youd expect from McDonalds but it seems the franchisee forgot to pay the heating bill Unprofessional and cold
32871,2,Very slow drive thru at 2am
10305,2,Although the food was fresh and I received plenty of ketchup Their soda fountain beverages were expired Every single one of them
33124,2,To slow in the morning
825,2,Its not the best like it was 2 years ago but not as bad as it has been in the past   They have to work out the mobile app ordering They lose orders plus app says theyre out of food
9851,2,its a McDonalds
982,2,This McDonalds is really going downhill service is slow biscuits overcooked and crunchy bacon burned and the place is a mess Couldnt find a clean table
827,2,I was glad to hear McDonalds lowered their coffee  frappe prices  they were having a special sale I had to repeat a simple two step iced coffee order SEVERAL times The drive thru worker was distraught as I gave back 1st one made wrong Another employee finished order by running out to car I questioned the workers about the cost  size of my drink all 3 said it was med size  turned out to be a SMALL  they got me a few weeks ago on that Girl who ran out order was ONLY ONE who acted professionally  provided great customer service SADLY the iced coffee prices are low because drink is so small if they could charge a fair price they would have a new regular 
121,2,I work late nights so I come here after my shift which is well after midnight Its rare I have a good experience when the overnight staff is running the show Missing items the quality of the food is just not good clearly its been sitting there for a while and it just seems like they have difficulty getting my order I get that it
9847,2,Poor 
25753,2,Too slowneed to be more welcoming and get orders right 
26620,2,Cashier on turn Apr3023 at 952a pretend didnt hear when when I asked twice please repeat the order just told me go to the next window of course the order was wrong

9497,2,Good taste like they dont change the oil
1273,2,Very very slow
980,2,Good deals and friendly service most of the time The drive thru wait time is always very long
826,2,Sorry to rate you a two but just 12 years ago you would of been rated a five You changed your fries and they are thinner and not as good and when you got a spicy chicken sandwich it was a spicy patty and came with lettuce and tomato now it is a crispy chicken patty with spicy sauce and pickles where is the lettuce and tomato oh you have to order a deluxe  You are getting cheaper with the food and the prices go up Not pleased very disappointed
10284,2,The slowest drive true that ever been I was in line for about 20 and they were only 4 cars ahead of me
32719,2,I would have gave it a higher rating if it wasnt for the bums the make it there personal hanging out place   ill nasty
26496,2,My experience visiting this place was not good It was not because the place that is a nice building with many things to do specially for kids but for the service This McDonalds offers Pasta and Pizza and I had the terrible idea of order a pizza along with many other things I have to wait more then an hour and 15 minutes for it  The place was plenty of tourists many of them in groups like mine and most of them had the same problem The staff attention was not good They were overwhelmed and didnt warning about the long waiting time In some cases one hour and a half This is considered the largest McDonalds in the World so it is another tourist attraction in the city They should improve their service especially in the pizza area As a positive comment I received a second ration of one of my orders for free in retribution for the long wait My recomendation is not to order pizza if you are in a hurry with a large group and during busy times
26721,2,"Theres a young man here that goes by the name of Muhammad He is extremely rude Not an exaggeration
He has no concept whatsoever of customer service He pointed at me and started demanding me to walk over to him because of a mistake he made He"

1139,2,Mickey Ds is just what it is 
26130,2,Didnt understerstand or couldnt understand simple English  Drinks moslty ice diluting flavor  Ask for no ice and get a cup of ice separate
10441,2,The food is the same as any McDonalds in the country however the manager does not care about customer satisfaction and should probably be working somewhere else
26469,2,"Massive homelessness dirty outside
No parking NO drive thru security more worried about masks then the drugs dealing at the door"
1147,2,Worst McDonalds I have ever been to
26722,2,"Every time Ive eaten there Ive never seen an employee clean or wipe down a table  Always sticky and Ive had  to use water and napkins to clean the tables before eating  Id think they would at least watch and take care of this situation   Also very drafty from AC over tables and if you want to have warm food eat fast   Ive asked if they could turn the AC down a bit but they said they couldnt
Picking another MD now"
9205,2,Buttermilk chicken was dry Horrible meal And cashier was really rude
26695,2,"Used the app to order but took 30 minutes to get it to me at the counter Thats way too long Tons of people got served before I did and my order was placed well before the other customers showed up The only thing going for this place is that its 24Hours drive through And dont use the app relaying orders to individual stores may have some bugs

081521
Update this place is torn down The building razed and the lot surrounded by fencing I guess the bums from the nearby overpass finally took its toll Too bad cuz the 24 hour drive thru was pretty convenient"

26474,2,Rude cashier Dirty seats and tables And full of very crazy looking peopledrugs i felt a little bit uncomfortable The Hot chocolate didnt taste like HC at all
1095,2,Even after expressing items that were missing they still got it wrong

33248,2,Of all the stores of the Macdonals chain that I have visited this is the slowest and without customer service The lady that they must know that employee by employee number was very abusive with her way of attending she was very closed in the explanation in the offer that she wanted she argued that it is not her problem to explain but only to place orders in mockery that she did not want order would cancel the order he fought because his service is like that as if he was going to give me the order as a gift
33270,2,"A rather dirty place the toilets were filthy

9690,2,Food is too salty
10729,2,This location had no happy meals for my 6 year old higher prices than normal around the city and had drunk people sitting all throughout the restaurant and many asking me for money while with my son I feel bad as they looked homeless did help one guy out but most were intoxicated and making a mess not being polite at all They need to clean that up as it scared some kids and also makes you uncomfortable Ive had this Happen every visit to this location

9015,2,"Ghetto dirty one employee in particular was extremely rude and clearly didnt want to be there
The food came out quickly so theres that"
10239,2,Homeless fighting in parking lot and harassing customers for money Dining area is messy and dirty It took 15 minutes to get my order A worker was behind the counter eating ice cream cone dripping it all over the place and herself

10238,2,Drive thru service is always slow at this location  I paid for my order at 645am and i know because i have my receipt but i got my food at 703am and this i know because i had to return a juice at 704am and i have a receipt for that as well 20 minutes of wait aside from the extra time i had to wait in line to get to the order speaker and then to the paying window   the only reason i waited is because i like to leave
912,2,"Time for McDonalds to open their doors for indoor seating
Pricing is getting out of hand as well  Can go to red Robin for 5 more and sit down to eat"
10789,2,incredibly long wait cashier was stoned out of his mind wearing no mask and slurring his words and forgot half of our food smiling creepily and saying random things
46,2,I ordered a Large fry buy after arriving to my destination I saw they did not fill the carton up  They gave me a small portion for what I paid for  This is not right and management needs to correct this  Stealing from customers is plain wrong  When ordering a large they expect to get what should come in a large  I noticed after my bad experience that your reviews are low  In order order to create a good business giving people an exceptional experience should be your goal not the opposite
673,2,Poor

10749,2,The service is horrible I ordered on the kiosk then waited 13 minutes  in line to pay There was only one person on front of me Employees rude to customers  At least the food was fresh  Well as fresh  as McDonalds  can be

26273,2,"Frequently at this location someone is spewing toxic gases into the air violating local laws  humane rights despite a security guard on site
Cashiers are expected to be able to actually perform elementary subtraction such as 1275 because the US doesnt mint 3 dollar bills and I already have enough singles to stuff Magic Mikes gstring
If this location has take out hours  dining room hours that should be posted on entry ways  online Otherwise we patrons expect to sit down not be told the seating area is closed 30 minutes prior to closing and 20 minutes after opening MGMT should schedule site  employee hours accordingly"
26372,2,They allow the homeless to beg in front of their door and people buy them food so they go inside and eat The problem is their smell We bring our tourists families and end up totally embarrassed
1381,2,Poor 
9757,2,What you expect
32958,2,Not to bad or not great somewhere in the middle
10087,2,The security will kick you out if you dont finish your food in 15 mins I was sooo shocked today when he came on me
1416,2,Poor 
25981,2,I like the new design but the customer service has gone down hill Way too many employees go there on their day off to socialize they hang around the registers distracting emplyees who should be focused on their stations and tending to customers The worst part is that one of the managers a young latino kid was engaged in of these conversations I asked the manager why he wasnt controlling his staff and he just looked at me and laughed
32899,2,Poor quality of food rude staff
9404,2,Based on experience with mc donalds in europe this is rather subpar But it is ok gets the job done in feeding you
35,2,We hit it off pretty good in the beginning everything was great but that didnt last long I mean the service is fast but with attitude an
10222,2,Im from a foreign place and I just happened to stop in this McDonalds for a quick bite These are the things I noticed 1 Active on site security inside the establishment I felt like I was being scrutinized I assume shady things go on here 2 I found out this McDonalds is located in an area called skid row 3 The price of the food here is above the average price of the rest of the united states of america 4 There isnt really a lot of friendly interaction between the clerk and the guest as well For the most part this is what I gathered from this place Taking into account that it was the first and only time Ive been there Not a good representation for Los Angeles for it being so close to the Greyhound bus station portal If its any consolation  I received my food hot and it was good
32444,2,Slow service manager working register and takeout not enough help
32784,2,Terrible Service the Sprite was water and ice literally
26005,2,"Used drive thru at 1215 am finally got my food at 1245 am They have two lanes for offering and only one window to dispatch food for those plus the uber drivers on foot at the window waiting for their orders

Food was kind of cold fries and breaded chicken tasted like burned oil and on top of that they didnt put any mayonnaise or ketchup for the fries

These big chains have no quality control
Its actually sad when you compare the food from the picture to what you really get"
26802,2,Like stepping back into the 70s this place hasnt been updated for many decades by the looks of it Very old fashioned Food a little greasy and saltier than other McDonalds branches Ive been to
8998,2,The only Mc that close s at 6pm and gos to driveway only
676,2,Poor 
836,2,The food was barely warm The cheese was cold and hard They threw my bag of food up on the counter What a dysfunctional restaurant
32799,2,Drive thru take longer than indoor ordering
8993,2,The employees were very rude and very unpleasant Need better people skills And better staff
897,2,Food order wrong and cold This place is on a downward spiral Used to love coming here because my order WAS hot when I got it and correct My sister and I go on french fry dates and McDonalds fries are our favorite Hard to find good McDonalds fries any more hatescoldfries
10764,2,Ive upgraded my review to 2 stars because in my drunken kindness I gave this place a second chance One of the only good employees seems like he got promoted to manager and this place seems to be visitable now Ill return again to see for sure because before it was definitely a terrible experience consistently
26793,2,Its a McDonalds so the food is very consistent Unfortunately the parking lot is impossible to use since the drive through wraps through it Ive been stuck in the parking lot for 20 minutes with no way to get out
32,2,"This location is wack
They will literally stop taking orders and make people sit in the parking lot for like 12 minutes until 300 am so that they dont get to order dinner food anymore
We have gone multiple times right after leaving the pinballz arcade just to sit in the parking lot in the DriveThru line waiting while they do nothing but wait for the order menu to change over
Look McDonalds if I wanted a breakfast deluxe I wouldnt have shown up at 230 in the morning thank you"
845,2,Well i order a crispy chicken sandwich small fry and a coke Normally I look in the bag this time I just reached in for a fry When I get home I find 10 piece nugget two BBQ sauces and a double cheese burger I was to far to go back so I ate 5 nuggets and half the burger Check your food people I was very disappointed but my dogs were thrilled
32440,2,"Used drive thru at 1215 am finally got my food at 1245 am They have two lanes for offering and only one window to dispatch food for those plus the uber drivers on foot at the window waiting for their orders

These big chains have no quality control
Its actually sad when you compare the food from the picture to what you really get"
10191,2,I mean McDonalds is McDonalds as far as the food is concerned fast  delicious and convenient The only problem with this particular McDonalds is the homeless population which of is no fault of McDonalds but you just have to be alert when going through the drive thru or dining in this location it can be quite dangerous at times the pan handlers can be very aggressive at times and confrontational So beware if you come to this location
9421,2,For one usually its only for coffee and to get away from the office as I stopped eating McDonalds food The problem I faced recently was a homeless person who walked up to me and asked for 2 dollars for bus fare When the bus stop is like 2 to three blocks down the road I said I will buy you something to eat or drink but not give money So  for folks or tourists who get folks coming to them asking for money I suggest trying to offer food to them is more important then money One thing about DC is there is alot of resources for folks who need money for bus fare or anything can find Food too they know where to go Its up to them to make that move Another major situation I noticed is the McDonalds need some updating I might know why they keep it so dull looking because McDonalds operates with the homeless so I guess they dont want to make it too comfortable I been to much better ones who got nice and cool lounge chairs couches and OMG this one just looks ragged
25699,2,Service was bad waited a long time for my food and coffee Then they gave me the wrong coffee
10763,2,"I went at 11 am at tooks almost 25 minutes to get mi meal Very poor attention
Second time 2022 I went to this Mac and the situation is the same that 4 years ago I think ist worst very dirty disorder everywhere completelly full bad mood in general That morning took me 45 minutes to get my breakfast I promise will never come back"

10103,2,I had messed up a order and I called them to tell him that I want to cancel the order and get a refund but the first time I called no one answer the phone the second time I called it answer with a ring but no one talked and that  happened to third time too I dont know whats going on The phone is probably broken but I still want my refund
26800,2,Gross bathrooms you know its sketchy because they have security outside of it
907,2,The bun was dry the fries werent the same Ill pass But the HiC orange was good
10776,2,Not very good service Unique location but a lot of mismanagement Some of the crew do not acknowledge you theyll look at you and walk by while youre trying to get their attention but keep walking and check on the fries or smoothie machine then go do something else I ordered a mobile order which I never did hear my order number called until I inquired about it and the team leader or manager said I said mobile order but you never came up I was like there couldve been several mobile orders you werent specific And theres constantly food and trash on the floor being picked up it reminds me of a GTA game
908,2,Its McDonalds for the love of God get the order right 1st of all 2nd of all put some napkins and utensils in the bag salt and pepper wouldnt kill you what apparently dont go to the drivethrough because you orders not gonna get done right and egg mcmuffin should not look like to sources rig muffins then you go inside and it takes you another 20 minutes to get U dam order its McDonalds for the love of God just pay attention I understand the pool that you have to pick from for help is very thin and limited
9000,2,Their free WiFi unfortunately does not work properly at this location at this time That should probably be maintained pretty soon
9009,2,Why did you give me all the wrong orders
25693,2,Bad service Very dirty Bums are everywhere  begging for something And did i mention very dirty Id go somewhere else next time
26785,2,Cold nuggets  Homeless people just walking around cars
26285,2,Did not help me with a refund and took awhile to convince worker to take a look at kiosk to fix it
26308,2,This is hands down THE worst McDonalds ever The staff are rude racist and intentionally slow Dont waste your time There was a fistfight in the dining area and the mens room was full of weed smoke
10753,2,Terrible experience They were out of milk out of chocolate milk out of toys for the happy meals for the kids and out of juice which they had to replace with this awful tasting fountain juice It took about 1520 minutes to get three happy meals for the kids The washrooms were dirty no hand towels no toilet paper and the hands air dryers did not work The staff however were nice and very helpful the reason for my 2 stars
26307,2,SOOOO busy all I ordered was a drink and who knows who actually got it
26287,2,Honestly the worst McDonalds youd expect more from one by the beach and turns out to be the worst experience
10105,2,"Didnt go inside this time wanted to use restroom they were closed Andthey ARE NOT open 24 hours ever They dining room closes ridiculously early Drive thru isnt 24 hours either

448,2,Terrible over the phone experience
26270,2,Waited in line for half an hour and it seemed like forever at the pickup window  I asked if they were short staffed and she said they were waiting on the fries But when I got them they were cold She offered no explanation until I got tired of waiting
9700,2,Lot of areas to improve
9004,2,Homeless people will ask for money in the parking lot The restroom has always had a dirty homeless guy washing himself or in the toilet stall  EVERYTIME that I have used it
647,2,ugly burgers
9456,2,Id say a below average McDonalds Very dirty and lots of homeless on weekends Ive been here No friendly workers here which is a McDonalds usual but you do generally get what you order somewhat quickly It is probably as cheap as youll get in the area
878,2,Ehhh Mcdonald really isnt something I do a lot and last time it wasnt good Fries were cold burger sucked Even my drink was wrongso I wasnt happy with my last meal here
32800,2,Lines are very slow in the night hours should hire more people

63,2,I placed an order the young lady at the drive thru kept having issues getting the order correctly I paid for my order went to the second window was given a huge bag that almost broke through with stuff I pulled up just a little bit to check my order  noticed I was missing an item fries so I pulled around to let the lady at the first window know Im missing something she just dismissed me to the 2nd window and the 2 ladies at the second window werent the best either  When I stated I drove back around because I was missing my fries I didnt realize my receipt was in the bag to confirm my order found it and gave it to one of the ladies the second lady Im guessing to be heard due to my inconvenience of my order not being correct for her to take ownership for what possibly could of went wrong and show some compassion instead of being kind of prude  after I received the fries the manager dismissed me with a condescending

Its dirty restroom has no water or soap to wash hands except if you use the handicap toilet which makes me wonder how often or ever the employees wash their hands before return back to work My husband got quite sick the following day because of the food

We placed the order on the machine for dinein with table service but there was not a single table  tent available well the store make it clear that you as a customer should better pickup your own food at the counter Theres absolutely no service at all

We will never ever go back to this McDonalds ever again"

10145,2,Four Quarter Pounder hamburgers and a large fry 30  McDonalds is expensive
10650,2,The problem I have with this location is that its always dirty in the lobby area and bathroom Second hardly anyone speaks English there and my Spanish is horrible so its hard ordering food sometimes The service is quick and food is usually hot and I had a problem once with the wrong order Check the lobby area and bathroom more frequently and use bilingual cashiers

10655,2,"Very busy location of course its Miami Beach
Typical Miami Beach Service attitude 4 out of 5 times when I have picked up an online order at this location I am the positive harmony seeking butterfly type of customer that walks in for pick up greets the human behind the counter with respect and a smile to than receive this nasty Miami Btch attitude that makes you regret not sticking to your fastfood free diet in an instant
Is it really hard to hire friendly and customer oriented personnel  There are so many seeking employment
At least teach em to pretend to be nice to customers That includes Managers btw
Further putting staff on the front counter who fairly understands English is just not fair to them and me the customer that just wants to pick up an order and leave fast Cause Fast Food you know Love the Sweet Tea def missed the lemon slices sadly not on their Menu at this Location
Still lovin it"
9061,2,The can be long lines in the drive thru Ive been approached by panhandlers here despite the presence of security officers

431,2,Its McDonalds what do you expect
9352,2,After many years not eating junk food this time I found the big Mac was worse than long time ago I guess downsizing pickles and tomatoes is their answer to healthy foods and cutting costs But of course it filled me up
26025,2,Ordered 20 piece nuggets and they were not fresh and were very hard like they were overcooked Also gave me the wrong sauce
9379,2,The employees are friendly Food comes out slow Too many homeless people inside beggin for money or food even though there are signs posted for 20 minute limit stays Im not unsympathetic to the homeless however the staff at this location permit them to hang out 
8975,2,Everyone was rude except for the manager that helped me at the end I think he was the manager how hard is it to get a iced coffee and ice cream in a cup 
9392,2,A little run down and doesnt have a full menu Really wanted some breakfast burritos but couldnt get any Food tasted fine but the employees were rude I think they assumed no one spoke Spanish but I do and I heard them making fun of customers and their accents and how they talk and what they were ordering
32459,2,Ordered 20 piece nuggets and they were not fresh and were very hard like they were overcooked Also gave me the wrong sauce
32473,2,Didn
25692,2,They always get my order wrong either they dont give me something or they give me the wrong thing
660,2,Poor 
26323,2,"Order was screwed up and the hash browns in both combo meals were barely cooked to just above raw
Amazing their staff could screw up two breakfast meals in the same order in an automated process SAD"
9462,2,Theyre supposed to serve breakfast until 11am but they stop WAY before that  Not cool
10795,2,Slowest McDonalds Ive ever experienced completely disorganized Plenty of employees around just nobody seems to kno
10149,2,This is place is always crowded with homeless ppl and their belongings The clerk taking your order is always impatient as if they have something way better to do than assist you and to top it off the dining hours end at 5pm so if youre not driving through drive thru tough luck save your money and go to another local McDonalds or the Farmer Boys less than a block away
26535,2,Very busy place No soda was available when ordering
32895,2,The people there is rude with the costumers
32978,2,Awful condition of the restaurant
439,2,Dirty bathrooms overall lackluster
10673,2,Before you can make it in McDonalds theres quite a few people asking for a handout Only self service kiosks No soap in the bathrooms How are the employees washing their hands Skip this one
9792,2,Unhygienic
10680,2,Nasty This place has gross people inside They look homeless Inside and out There was a mentally ill woman yelling at staff when I visited I dont feel safe Its dirty They messed up my order They are in a rush Looks very busy here staff cant keep up They have given up
68,2,"McDonalds is usually pretty bad about inventory shorts especially
The BBQ sauce its just a conspiracy but if you ever been a lover of Mcys Nuggets then you know they tend to Forget the BBQ sauce Any other sauce and its in there But overall I dont see my self going back anytime soon"
8946,2,The lobby guy is friendly but coughing by people who are eating Staff were not friendly about no longer being able to take verbal orders and only using the kiosk
866,2,"Food was alright Wasnt really hot and my husbands bagel was stale But it wasok I guess

The place was trashed Not one clean table and garbage everywhere yet we were the only ones in the place the whole time we ate and very few people were going through drive thru There were two managers onno one thought to clean Cant blame it on being busy

Cashier was new and a bit rude We ordered three meals She rang everything up separate but left off our hash browns Manager made us pay to get our hash browns Forget that it was all way more expensive cause of how she rang it up to begin withthen the cashier kept telling the manager in front of us that we never said we wanted meals even though when I repeatedly told her we wanted meals she kept saying sure I can make that a meal for you

Completely unprofessional and we left feeling disgusted by the whole experience"
9394,2,Drive thru service took 25 mins
9043,2,Typical of corporate America to say give us money in return will give you processed food and a clown to help you wash it down
932,2,Food was fine tho I have reason to believe it was spit in Also when I requested the inspection report as the sign clearly specifies I was given a nasty look and was completely ignored by the cashier named Greta
26380,2,I expect crowding because its close to the beach The ice machine is always out they dont have enough fresh brewed tea to refill the container and some of the employees have attitude The security guard tends to trip but its not always the same guard Service is pretty fast considering the volume of customers I only go there because of proximity
858,2,Slowest place and folks do t care
26246,2,Too much wait at midnight Burger had unsatisfing taste and coke had no soda
10256,2,Very nice inside and clean But why do they allow homeless people just to sit and not purchase food Paying customers need to sit Not coming to this location again
8939,2,I sat in the drive thru for 20 minutes just now because the manager on shift at the window was on their phone the whole time while they were severely understaffed
10265,2,There is a security guardcop standing around and he makes me feel unsafe for some reason A black bum was harrassing me and tell cop looked on Its not walker friendly as there is a gate around the outside At least it was clean on the inside
9807,2,I will be brief I have never seen such a McDonalds The furniture probably has not changed since the opening of the first institution 1948 apparently the dress code does not apply here The counters are served by people in civilian clothes it is not clear who they are Okay I ordered food on the spot to eat he hands me a bag of food
9806,2,I couldnt recognize the order so I waited for 10 minutes and verbally told them but they finally started making it but they brought something completely different from the order so it took even longer In the meantime other customers were asking for exchanges if they were different from the order
10071,2,"No self service slow service they messed orders up requested no bacon in a meal but they included it despite being shown on the affixed sticker however food was tasty albeit cold
To add insult to injury the staff were relatively impolite"
32970,2,Cleanliness is not a priority
25974,2,Cant hate on the workers its Mcdonalds just dont go to this location And good luck trying the drive thru if you have plans in the next 2 hours
26338,2,Its a McDonalds that food is the same as every other McDonalds is decent didnt like the place because it was too crowded too messy and took forever just to get a soda or no people were nice workers were nice
26382,2,No Refills  It took about 10 minutes for me and everyone else in line to get their order done They could only give you 3 ranch for 20 Chicken Nuggets not even 4 Fo
26336,2,The locations looks great and has 8 of machines that allow you to order and pay but the service was horrible I ordered a sundae for my mom and after 10 minutes of waiting I saw one employee feel a tear in her pants below her butt and then she went and fixed herself a sundae and left At this same moment another came up and asked about the sundaes for his family that he ordered 20 minutes prior I was given a refund without fuss before leaving The bad part to all of this was there were about 12 people working at the location during my visit which was more than enough to prepare and delivery the food quickly
32893,2,This place is always getting the order wrong
12,2,"We stopped by for a quick breakfast  It was not crowded inside but there was a pretty long drive thru

Our order was supposed to have 3 food items and 2 drinks They missed a food item The lady ignored me when I told her

My husband went to get it she finished her task then handed it to him without a word or smile or anything"
66,2,They get an extra Star because their staff 8 of 10 have been polite Drive through has issues They constantly get order wrong Ask you to pull forward to fix and leave you hanging I have had to go in twice to see why I am still sitting after five minutes They are new I understand training new people But when you place an order and they repeat it back correctly and it comes out wrong or you have to repeat 3 times to make sure they get it right Someone inside needs to make sure they are reading the whole ticket Not just a quarter pounder Especially with the multi menu choice of adding bacon or lettuce and tomatoes Their tea as of late has tasted like dish soap and their fountain drinks have a funky taste to them Numerous times their fries have been under cooked
22595,3,Foods fresh but they are the slowest MacDonalds Ive ever been too
19265,3,Its alright but after buying several honey buns they didnt even hand us coupons for honey buns like other McDonalds do drive thru is usually long
22576,3,Typical McDonalds except it is so busy they have a hard time keeping it clean  We went there mainly because we needed internet access which was free
30444,3,We went twice during a long wknd Service was TERRIBLE they got our order wrong overcharged us both times and took forever It was the onlyfast food or we would not have gone there
15942,3,Fastish

15964,3,Fast at times too fast
30440,3,Conveniently 24 hrs and on my route back home but ordered 2 mcdoubles with mac sauce and medium fries didnt get the fries and only 1 had mac sauce on it double check your food before you go
22458,3,Fast service not many people when I visited after 9pm but those chicken nuggets are not worth the midnight troubles
22460,3,Better than the other one close to here at least they stay open until they say they are
19209,3,If youre turning left into the parking lot its a pain due to traffic blocking entrance Employee at drive thru asked us to pull over to the side to wait for our order but since there was already a car there she said we need to go to the otherside that means we have to pull out and turn back in It was already a pain to get in the first place and now we have to do it again My husband refused and said well just wait right there at the window Need to come up with a better system than that Other than that ordeal our food was hot fries were fresh They failed to put tartar sauce on my kids filet o fish sandwich though
506,3,Goood good good

20601,3,Mcds cant beat the price
22359,3,Its alright Although they need to upgrade on a few features especially public restrooms even Burger King in Waikiki Beach is way smaller than McDonalds on Kalakaua and it has bathrooms What I dislike the most is when the employees forget my order and then gives me missing pieces of the order for example you would order a Big Mac 20 piece chicken nuggets and a soft drink and then they forget your chicken nuggets And dont tell me you didnt experience this all my years in Waikiki and yet they fail to exceed my order
19201,3,Newark  Penn station Its a rough atmosphere to work in at least is the not square its not that bad not great its not 5 star restaurants but the people treated with

617,3,Neutral
30847,3,The real coke tastes like diet coke Please clean machines
16414,3,Im giving this McDonalds location a 3 star rating This was due to the fact that their fries werent all that great and meat was a bit oily in the quarter pound burger Ive also noticed that the quality of their buns arent what they used to be Not sure if Im the only one whos noticed the change
30844,3,Its another cookie cutter just like the rest Good polite service with clean tables though
16412,3,What more can you say about McDonalds Its what it is and their prices just keep getting higher Fast food used to also be remotely inexpensive Now they think they are fine dining with their prices going up quarterly
16410,3,Soda was just fizzy water Burger was undercooked Fries were good and hot
3362,3,Tiny place nowhere to get straws napkins etc
30841,3,The food takes a little to make but its was good
19772,3,The usual McDonalds
16406,3,Its McDonalds Their menu is growing and has a number of new additions that look to be a bit healthier but I come for the comfort of a Big Mac or Whopper  This location is situated in an area that limits parking and the drive through fills up the the point where it causes issues on the street Theres minimal seating although Ive always found a table It is clean and the staff the normal level of friendly and helpful
16404,3,"Google keeps bugging me to review it so here goes    Its Mcdonalds You know what youre in for when you go  Theres always a 5050 chance that your fries will be hot and delicious or cold and nasty  Ill only add that this particular McDs suffers from being next door to one of the largest homeless encampments in LA  Be prepared to be asked usually politely by a transient for food
Of course this isnt really the fault of the McDonalds and Im not making any judgements I eat here frequently since its just off the freeway near my house and McDs in general has improved their food over the past few years"
30835,3,They wasnt ready for our convention when you got 500 people out late at night dont think they arent gonna want food
30833,3,It was okay even though I ordered a big Mac and the bottom bun was actually a middle bun

16449,3,Hey what can I say But Sure make not just good  Damn good hot French Vanilla Latte with whipped cream on top I like it so much they recognize my voice coming thru the drive thru in Sherman Oaks The only thing I like better is when someone brings it home to me and we put just a timble full of Bristole Cream or Kalua or my favorite Pennsylvania Dutch Egg Nog in it Oooh weeeee Better watch that Penn Dutch Sure will creep up on you though
16448,3,This isnt IN n OUT and people do actually want to look at the menu so having your employees stand outside in the hot sun around the corner from the full menu taking orders with an out dated sandwich board is pretty ridiculous I ordered a 7 from the board which was a 6 in his tablet so my order was wrongWhy cant we simply order thru the box like normal drivethrus McDonalds
16447,3,Soso McDonalds but its the closest to the house They could do a much better job of cleaning it and also getting rid of the vagrants the sit for hours If youre looking for friendly service dont bother but its mcdonalds who come for the service They drive thru is fine but gets way backed up
30875,3,Friendly staff but the slowest service everytime i  go ots at least 15 min
16444,3,Small and cramped inside always seems busy Parking lot is small too but drive through delivers standard menu mostly reliably Easy access to freeway at this location too
16443,3,Small McDonalds Clean The restrooms were locked and I had to find somebody to let me in That always frustrates me The place had about 50 of the staff needed to meet the crowd

3336,3,The service was not fast in the morning
22229,3,Had to use the kiosks and thats not the best way to order for me
16430,3,As far as a McDonalds chain restaurant would go I can say that this is a decent location its really a McDonalds so I dont know how much you could realistically expect out of a place like this you know a fast food chain but the food here is on par with any other McDonalds is there The drivethru is relatively quick which is good
3337,3,Ok food Noisy childish crowd
30861,3,Ok but they forgot my bottom is bun on my fish sandwich  I had to ride all the way back
19790,3,They take too long some employees are not very friendly in terms of cleaning it is very good

22276,3,The restaurant is across the road from the beach The building is very plain with one small sign above the main entrance door The restaurant was clean the employees were constantly busy keeping the tables clean and emptying the trash bins The orders can be placed at the kiosk or at the counter  The orders are returned fast There is plenty of seating space
30761,3,Delicious food and cheap after having a few drinks only thing is wait time is bad
30752,3,Always good for an affordable meal
16341,3,Not truly 24 hours Have been multiple times between the hours of 12am4am and have been denied service either due to not serving food or not processing payments Daytime operation is fine

22152,3,This is a convenient location but was unfortunately out of some Hawaii specific food items The seating area was clean but the ordering area was congested The breakfast platter is a musttry at any Hawaii McDonalds location The coffee was also very good All in all this location is serviceable If you can get to a different location then do it
658,3,Neutral
32930,3,Drivethru is slow

16540,3,Good food But the area has so so many homeless people Be careful after dark
22156,3,Longer waits to order and to get food Food was good Not many homeless people like most reviews suggested
16536,3,I am giving this a low rating because it is at an intersection that is not easy to get in and out of The parking lot is tiny and you just cant work with it

22415,3,Meh the place usually has a line free refills and free  WiFi  Most meals come with PINEAPPLE but its 200 extra  At the time of order simply ask for no PINEAPPLE and the mealprice will be cheaper  If you forgot to ask for no PINEAPPLE in most cases they give you an apple pie

3514,3,So so

22853,3,This McDonalds is way more efficient than the other McDonalds down by  Animal Kingdom with the drive thru they are also a lot more friendlier at least on the intercom But they didnt cook my quarter pounder to temp because it was still red on the inside of the meat which was disgusting I had to go to the door in order to get my burger fixed which then I ran into the situation of them starting to close their doors 5 minutes before they were supposed to close at 12 and the employee looked at me and said we are closed when I literally was holding the burger in my hand to show for proof I look at the employee and say I know I came up here because I had just ordered from the drive thru this burger and it isnt cooked all the way She takes the burger doesnt say anything and shuts the door with me standing outside I then wait thank gosh she came back with a new one I didnt know if she was going to I didnt get an apology though for my burger not being cooked all the way through though
22854,3,Not sure I have ever been to one that deserves 5 stars  This was run of the meal McDonalds  Average in everyway
22856,3,Went there for Doordash pick up Store was close So I parkedy car and walked to the drivethrough window A staff told me I have to get in line with all the drive through customers Which took me almost half an hour just to get to the window in my car Thats nuts The order has already been placed and all Im doing is just picking it up You guys gotta find a better system or else close this place down if you cant get it together
84,3,Decent McDonalds location  The team here has always been friendly  Drive thru can get pretty backed up during normal meal periods so often it is better to go inside  Make sure you go close to regular meal periods for fresher food vs the ones under the heat lamp for a while    Store is always clean
4848,3,Neutral
133,3,I tried the spices chicken nugget sauce for the first time It was like a thick Tabasco and I liked it a lot more than I thought I would I ate that instead of my burger
15412,3,I like the upgrades done to this McDonalds No play place for kids but a few tables have huge tablets for kids to play with Only issue was the temperature inside place was very warm at the time I visited mid afternoon Maybe issue has been fixed since then
4613,3,The service was slow
4618,3,Mecca for junkies and the old
29921,3,I mean its McDonalds not a five star restaurant so a generous 3 is what Im giving
4624,3,24 hours a plus
33310,3,CHILEAN I visited this MC Donald on one of my trips and its good close to Lincoln And it tastes like always Local a little small located in a corner also has automac
196,3,Hadnt been to McDonalds in a couple years it was better    THAN thought it was gonna beDidnt have a choice
192,3,Typically love going here hate that I ordered a medium and got a small instead this morning Even asked her if she was sure that was a medium and she said yes
19419,3,Did not get what i ordered and the orange juice was hot no ice
19425,3,Small portions of food at increased prices
4628,3,I mean its just a city McDonalds
4629,3,Food was terrible
188,3,Decent for junk food but each extra packet of your desired sauce costs an extra 25 Good and quick staff
29901,3,The international drive McDonalds looks great but the play place was closed  this was the reason for bringing my kids  so this was a HUGE let down it was 7pm on a Sunday night when we went in the middle of a tourist city Too bad 
186,3,Staff has changed and service isnt great
29898,3,Its McDonalds you know what youre going to get before you get there This one is all kiosks
15468,3,This place really depends on who is working sometimes there on there A game other times you have to deal with the BS and get a manager My worse experience here was handed a 20 bill to the cashier my total owed was just about 5 bucks they gave me two 5s back and said have a nice day I caught this on the fly by luck and said you still owe me a 5 and some change the cashier said no you gave me 15 dollars I said no they dont make a 15 dollar bill long story short had to have them count the whole register down with the manager there just to get my correct change back
19427,3,I dont remember if I was here since all McDonalds are pretty much the same
4609,3,Too many homelesses
4608,3,No toilet paper
4604,3,Not to much attention
29965,3,They have several self check out kiosks
4563,3,Fries could use more salt
29960,3,Waited 25 mins Wasnt busy Half food was cold The deluxe quarter pounder only had lettuce and mayo added No sauces for 26 chicken nuggets Guy who brought the food really didnt wanna talk or answer the question because he all but ran to the back Again drive thru wasnt busy and instead had maybe 3 families and 3 singles And the single people had their food already
4568,3,Another McDonalds Just good when you have no other choice
19616,3,Good for fast foods
4572,3,A very average urban McDonald
205,3,Standard food and service It was quick and efficient The outside parking lot and drivethru area was dirty and grungy
4579,3,The toilets were disgusting 
203,3,Our order was wildly messed up and it took them two times to fix it but they did it with a great attitude and smile
29943,3,"Disappointing The pictures of the food is inaccurate Meals showing you get hashbrowns show no hashbrowns when you begin the order Hashbrowns themselves ordered separately show two but you get one

Deal on a large iced coffee was very good though Also some of the staff especially this nice elderly lady was pleasant"
29935,3,I was charged for medium drinks with my kids happy meals The drinks werent even what they wanted The fries werent hot or fresh I ordered a coke with another meal got a sweet tea
4597,3,Another Broadway McD don

4602,3,Place could be cleaned
4603,3,The usual as usual
4644,3,Nice toilet
137,3,24 hour drive through but they start breakfast only around 4 am which I find irritating af I did not go there at 420am for a egg McMuffin
15463,3,When you order they dont tell you anything is out until after you pay get up to the 2nd window to receive your food Food is good though
19434,3,Never get your order right and there slow
19452,3,It was really dirty when I went
33338,3,Soso I took a sandwich which is under the 5th number there right in the picture you can see that there is a tomato and they gave without a tomato 
4713,3,Dirty place
155,3,Hit and miss on getting my order right  They are always quick to get the food out and its generally hot and fresh  What they lack in accuracy they seem to focus on in speed of service
4716,3,It is Mcdoalds
15422,3,Check your order before you drive away
19457,3,They are slow but I love McDonalds
19601,3,Good ppl and food
19459,3,Good workers just in a bad area customers are rude
33341,3,McDonalds stop Nothing to complain about Usual junk food Queue at the drive in mostly full Good access route
29825,3,They would do a lot better if they didnt park every car in the drive thru I know they do this just to make their drive thru time look better to the higherups but it absolutely ridiculous  Simply process your orders faster and give customers their order Every time Ive been parked Ive ended up waiting 510 minutes When Im only ordering 1 or 2 combos it makes it a little asinine
4728,3,With how expensive everything is everything is already long since I didnt eat a hamburger with chips
144,3,Meh Its McDonalds what can I say you get what you pay for Dont expect the place to be clean or the employees to be over the moon with courtesy Like I said you get what you pay for This is not a bad review its just a Meh review because its McDonalds Its not like youre eating at a fivestar Resort and getting a massage afterwards However if McDonalds does decide one of these days to start serving alcohol I might have to pay it another visit I dont go to McDonalds often I only stopped in out of convenience Like I said this is not a bad review to disrespect McDonalds in any way
4729,3,Better place than others I just asked for a soda
33345,3,Very slow service
29822,3,Visited the worlds biggest McDonalds on international drive Pizza and burger ordered were great however had to wait over an hour for food as it was so busy Pizza also came first table delivery and advised remainder of the order would be delivered shortly Had to then ask again after around 15 minutes Order was quickly brought but believe this would have been forgotten if we had not asked Overall good was fine but service poor due to being so busy
4720,3,Hamburgers
19447,3,I did take out Service was prompt
165,3,The wait time was not good my fries was warm and my order was wrong I didnt feel like waiting another 15 minutes for some hot fries and revised order
167,3,"Couldnt get a order right When I got home they had the burgers all wrong Tried to call and for a hour and a half they never answered
Was really disappointed "

15444,3,Get regular mayo packets not light mayo packets and then you are a star and a half more
29850,3,"Very busy drive thru Cars were lined up literally around the building from pick up windows all the way to the front on the restaurant facing International Drive Informed at the window that they were out of food items we ordered and asked if we can order something else

However even though we had a big order everything was in the bag The food were also hot and fresh"

29845,3,53019  On the way back from all day at Universal Island of Adventures so decided on a cheaper meal to end the night Had dinner with family here Busy night but able to order our meals from the auto screens instead of counter and pay Cool since in Georgia they havent caught on at many yet Ordered several meals and customized my Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich meal to include bacon pickles and cheese and a large fry Service was great for me They managed to work around us and keep things clean in the eating areas and bathrooms Enjoyed the experience Went back for dessert but paid at the counter and let them know we appreciated the service

30349,3,Stopped in here on January 24th 2018 and ordered at the counter a signature classic grilled signature sriacha chicken sandwich with an artisan bun Paid for my order and waited When my order was ready it was handed to me in a bagI asked for ketchup and proceeded to a table to enjoy my meal First off tge fries were crispy which I prefer but they were old and not at all indicative of the worlds best fries I took out my sandwich took bite and noticed sesame seeds in the box I Checked my receipt to confirm that my sandwich should gave had the artisan bun proceeded to the counter  to correct the problem with my order to be told tgey were out of artisan buns I was pissed and walked off I finished my meal went to refill my drink and spoke with a man in yellow shirt and tie behind the counter about how terrible that the one woman knew there were no artisan buns but the order taker at the register knew nothing about it as well as the girl who gave me my food Someone should have confirmed that the sesame seed bun would meet my approval And I notified him this kind of service was not indicative pf McDonalds and that I would be callong corporate The following day I contacted McDonalds corporate who passed on my complaint to the restaurant location I received a call from Rose who apologized for the problem with the order and asked that I come back and give them the opportunity to make tge meal properly per my request I stopped in on Friday January 26th and Emma made sure that the meal was prepared to the standards I believe McDonalds is known The sandwich was flavorful with the artisan roll and the fries were hot and fresh Thanks so much for taking the initiative to prepare my meal to the high quality McDonalds is known to deliver

30346,3,"This McDonalds has kiosk only ordering Its a good idea you order grab a number and sit down If you are getting a  to go order they tell out your name  I wish there was a more modern way to know your order is ready
A pager or digital board instead of someone telling out names"

30372,3,Dude got my order wrong asked for the double fish but got a single I didnt notice until I got back to my hotel He did seem new so
30371,3,I stopped in this McDonalds because it was on my way home The manager did not want to help me and kept sending me to the kiosk to place my order Now i was looking to ask a question but she turned around and didnt even want to acknowledge that I was there and kept telling the other workers i had to go to the kiosk  If there isnt anyone available to help answer a question there should be a phone to pick up and ask for help She was so rude

4380,3,Kinda dirty but super friendly service
4381,3,Nice McDonalds but the problem is all the junkies and high school kids be in there fighting and hanging out  I really feel bad for security and the staff
4384,3,Okay today
273,3,Ordered the 2 filetofish for 5  and they were barely hot
30058,3,It was crowded I ordered fres and nuggets Fr
33281,3,The tables are clean in sight but there is a lot of problem with homeless inside the restaurant Preferably go through the drive thru
22785,3,The fries were not like stateside McDonalds fries
22779,3,Ordering has become very slow
30048,3,they rarely get my order right  I know my order is taken correctly because the woman who does drive thru she has a long braid and she is amazing
30046,3,Its fast food so its hit or miss Often the fry grease tastes old The Tea fluctuations in sweetness can throw you for a loop going anywhere from bitter to syrup Half the time late shifts miss part of your order and if they are busy sometimes the food especially fish and chicken wraps do not appear to be fully cooked Other times its great
19638,3,Its ok 
30043,3,The food was alright but the arcade area was a total letdown for my 5 and 6 year old We only spent 10 but essentially none of the games worked and they didnt get any tickets when they should have To small children this is a big letdown The young man at that counter was kind and apologized and I get it
30041,3,This mc Donalds is self order only And the self order board wasnt working properly So it made for a lengthy wait They dont have any cash sale lines It seems they only want drive through business  As far as the foodwell you know what your gonna get here
19637,3,Food cold
33292,3,The service seemed a bit slow to me The order machine was not working to pass the card
4425,3,Good quick service and plenty of seating
30047,3,As so often is the case my big Mac wasnt hot  fresh  hubbys coffee was cold  but they did replace that no friendliness of staff  just functional
30072,3,Took forever to get our food every day we were there this week when they got very busy One night we were there for almost an hour waiting in a crowd I feel like they might have been understaffed because they werent working quickly Everything was good and correct but they ran out of one items I ordered so they replaced it with a different flavor
4373,3,About what one would expect from a McDonalds 
4372,3,It was alright Service could be faster
19640,3,Its igh
4327,3,Tough neighborhood Lol Who would think one could get shot at Union Square 
279,3,Its McDonalds I like getting breakfast here it tastes okay and is super convenient and fairly cheap
22767,3,Macdonalds USA serve spam bergers not my faves
4334,3,Decor is great but its dirty Gets a lot of homeless and druggie types hanging out
4335,3,The best thing about Mac Donalds while wandering in NY is that you can use their bathrooms And get a coffee  for a good price
33268,3,I believe that there should be more empathy with the client and guide them in their order for those who do not know the menu a smile does not hurt anyone
4343,3,It is a small McDonalds in Manhattan Not very crowded The staff is grumpy The food is what you can expect at McDonalds
19379,3,Restaurant was clean Staff was fine Not a bad area Food is typical McDonalds
4346,3,A homeless guy asked me for money to get something to eat I told him I would buy him something and he asked me for McDonalds Seems to be the customer base here
4348,3,Its McDonalds there is a bathroom for customers Not sure what else I can say
4351,3,"Had to ask to have the table cleaned
Pan handles nearby unfortunately
Prices and food were the usual"
4356,3,One of the cashiers was given tho much attitude and didnt have patience for the customers to get the coupon
30079,3,I came here on my way to a meeting in the convention center I had 20 minutes to be where I needed to be so I figured I would swing by this McDonalds and grab some food Boy was that a mistake I arrived at this McDonalds at 1145 I did not order my food at the drivethru window until 10 minutes after 1200 By the time I actually got my food it was closer to 1230 This has to be the absolute slowest McDonalds in the history of any restaurant in the world It has double drive throughs and they seem to prefer the inside Lane to the outside lane They were taking the orders of customers on the inside line too if not three to one Not exactly sure what was going on inside the building But they were slower than molasses I understand that there is issues right now with finding employees for a little bit of prep work would have sped up the process a little bit Thats why I gave them three stars instead of one
22771,3,Reliable You know why you are coming here and you know exactly what to expect
4363,3,This location is not open 24 hrs as indicated closes around 11pm
4364,3,What more do expect from a fast food restaurant
22788,3,They will mess up your order no matter what
282,3,You have to be more careful and packing up the food through the drivethru
4431,3,Its the city Its always packed and always theres interesting people here
4435,3,Very crowded during the afternoon I recommend going towards night
19404,3,Decent McDonalds only problem is late at night they run out of food
33304,3,If you like potatoes its fine its a normal hamburger place theyre not that big I give it 3 stars good parents and Sunday nothing more
4499,3,Standard fare  Better after the renovation
4501,3,Its McDonalds for when you need those 1 am french fries
4507,3,Good service no refill
4509,3,Need more people working service to slow
29990,3,"Typical service But its mcdonalds so dont expect too much Intercom person was rushing but got upset when we asked to repeat our order We were just making sure it was placed right

Fries were good as always Went before 1 so the lunch rush was over My big mac patties were dark instead of brown Couldnt eat it But lets hope your experience is better"
19403,3,Good service clean environment Bathroom stall has no luck which is kind if intrusive
4516,3,Fast clean good service
19407,3,Please bring back the McDonalds practices and policies from the 70s and 80s when food was handled and prepared with care
33305,3,"Unpleasant smell

Gotta get some cleaning tips from MC Donalds in BRAZIL"
4526,3,McDonalds has really cheap good coffee
4528,3,Very poor service and untidy
211,3,Very slow drive thru  Person at window where you pay was very nice however the lady at 2nd window didnt even smile
4529,3,It has 24 hour Breakfast
4535,3,Normal McDonalds not much else to say
4518,3,Dirty restroom slow service
22795,3,I spend a lot of money here everyday and today me and a friend came here for breakfast The water for my tea was hot but her coffee was cold Do better I would have given a higher star rating if her coffee was hot and made properly
223,3,Missing food used mobile app no way to get refund for missing items in app
4486,3,Ok breakfast skip biscuits tasted old
4436,3,This McDonalds was sort of like purgatory Lost souls all over the place
4438,3,Quality tends to be hit or miss and this location has gotten rather pricey
244,3,Food was a little cool Big Mac was dry and lacking i like my McDonalds fresh and hot 
4449,3,As the previous reviews have pointed out this McDonalds seems to also be a homeless shelter
19628,3,Junk food
4452,3,They could clean the tables a bit more ofte5
30017,3,The staff could have been a little more attentive to people when they have questions Instead they were all standing there talking not acknowledging people if they had a question including me I had a question about the new disney 50th toys whether I could buy them individually or only in the happy meal and she was like annoyed that I asked One gentleman wanted to order at the counter and they just yelled from behind the counters you have to place your order at the kiosk so he walked away He wanted to pay cash and didnt know how to do it on the kiosk but they didnt want to be bothered I understand times are tough right now I work in food service as well but there is no need to snap and be rude to someone with a simple question
236,3,Some people here dont like to protect others because they dont fully cover their nose and mouth with the masks
235,3,Not bad not great but almost always open
4469,3,Milkshake are so much better then the uk
30011,3,Ordered meals fries where not full Had to ask for small fry we ordered No straws in the bag But other then that food was good
4475,3,The personal is not kind The food is alright
4476,3,Store was dirty and the staff were pushy
4477,3,Nice location Decent service
33298,3,good taste very late 45 min in line at 11 pm
4482,3,Always being harassed by security and beggers there cant eat in peace
30006,3,This McDonalds is nice but when a conference is happening you can easily wait 2530 minutes for a standard cheeseburger as I did Overall not terribly impressed
4434,3,Never overly crowded Service is decently quick
283,3,McDonalds is McDonalds what great things happen here the same menu forever
4317,3,Its ok I mean u get your food fast and you get out faster
15628,3,They upgraded the place and it nice here but its hot they need to turn on the ac Workers here are helpful said hi when i walked in nice touch
33245,3,too little staff for the amount of customers
15696,3,Some of the people that work here are super super nice The facilities are in really rough shape and the wifi is pretty awful
30158,3,The management staff were bullying a new employee by telling her have needed to clean the dirty trays  the manger did this while the girl was taking my order very uncool The rest of the staff in the drive through laughed at the the poor girl and I was embarrassed for her I mean I know its just a starting job for some people but they still need to be professional
22743,3,Fast and alway same taste good rocation
19651,3,Just like the others
19344,3,Service was nice would feel more comfortable if people were sitting at the table eating Like family
30157,3,"Great food Not speaking English at the drivethrough window is a big downfall for me  Not sure why they would put somebody like that taking orders I repeated myself three different times and then they finally brought somebody else to the window Very frustrating
RJ"
329,3,Its McDonalds fast service with a tummy ache later
22746,3,Open 247 for all your dining needs
4195,3,Frequently drama filled Staff can be disorganized and arguing amongst themselves in front of customers Homeless and users are common General stop for tourists to use the bathroom Access to reasonably priced items relatively quickly makes it worthwhile for a quick visit
30153,3,This McDonalds is across the street from the Orange County Convention Center The girl at the counter looked at us when we got there and made no attempt to greet us or even approach the counter until we asked her if she was Ok The food was fine but the service definitely needs improvement
15686,3,Friendly quick service but forgets the condiments from time to time Always check your bag before you leave
324,3,They are good on certain days
323,3,As always bleh food but great bathrooms
15682,3,This place lets my daughter eat whatever she wants after practice they have good service
4208,3,Clean The fries 
19345,3,Take to l text too long to the drive thru when certain people are there who speaks English you get the order much faster I probably they have an understanding problem
4169,3,Was there about 2 months ago Ordered a burger and fries Fries werent too bad but they messed up my burger I just wanted a plain burger they loaded it up with things They let me exchange it which was nice The other thing that I didn
333,3,Sometimes you dont get your order right
4153,3,Was asked to buy food in order to use the electrical plugs turned out they werent working
4102,3,Neutral
4108,3,Neutral
33239,3,nice place but bad is that most of the time you have to wait a long time for the food and the employees are not very friendly or attentive to customers and not to mention drive thru the wait is unbearable
4114,3,The Big Mac patty was perfectly dry with no flavor just right for the drunk folks with taste buds vanished long ago in the weekend festivities The staff was accommodating and friendly allowing us to use the bathroom Kindness goes a long way
30185,3,"As I do not nor have I ever cared for McDonalds my wife really enjoys coffee I tried there coffees as I was not blown away I will not be so quick in the future to pass up another location if need a special cup of Joe

We did not eat any food  Location was clean Staff was typical young peeps wishing they were anywhere but there"
22729,3,Friendly staff but not a very clean business
341,3,They forgot the side in the kids meal and noone will answer the phone
33240,3,It is said that it is 24 hours a day but in truth it is between 8 AM and around 10 PM I imagine it is for reasons of not having enough staff to work
336,3,Clean restaurant and fast service Ok food
30182,3,Wait was not too long at all Line moved evenly Although order was incorrect and corrected It took a long time to get 1 drink
4124,3,Its a hit or miss with McDonalds location At times you can recieved a good customer service and wait a long while to get your food When you finally get your food from waiting so long this is when its not busy the food is not assembled properly or its over cooked almost border line burnt If you wanted coffee from this location major of the staff cant make good coffee I often look for a particular employee that makes it the best On the other hand this location is one of the most cleanest locations Ive ever been in Management does a good job making sure everything is clean and ready for business Every time I come in their always cleaning the deep fryer counters refilling the machines and all despite all the college kids and tourists wreaking the joint They do pick up the place in high traffic and complete orders in a timely manner with sacrifice to customer experience I would love to see more pride in the making of the order look close to the photo and consistency with delivering good customer service
19654,3,Food was cold
22734,3,Regular  restuarant Used WiFi  Heavy  WiFi traffic
30177,3,We used the kiosks to order and pay for the food You are supposed to take a number and sit down and they will bring you your food We had to wait for numbers She told me theyve had those kiosks for at least 8 months The staff was overwhelmed with the amount of orders We had to get the food ourselves from the counter My poor mom had to wait in the line because she couldnt make the kiosk work She was so stressed out by the time she sat down
22736,3,24 hour ser I e Fast eSy to get to
22737,3,Mostly a tourist destination expensive compared to average cost of McDonalds in mainland US
22740,3,The frapacinos are cold and taste really good
322,3,Clean place good music on sound system close to discount movies
320,3,Completely average unclean cheap cool but occasionally absentminded staff
22752,3,Kiosks broken and surrounded by homeless shouting
4214,3,The food is predictably reliable as it is part of the McDonalds NY franchise  Automated ordering and paying with a pick up counter puts this one uptodate  But the clientele here may be a little wilder than some other locations and at this one the single bathroom was unsanitary and had no working lock  Ugh
15649,3,The price is fine but no matter what McDonalds I go to I always hav
30122,3,When we went it was cash only They were out of ice cream and frappes Our food was decent They were extremely slow
4284,3,"Not the best McDonalds
Out of stock on alot of items"
15646,3,Little pieces of chicken instead of strips Large drinks were not even close to being filled The fries and sandwiches were perfect
4286,3,Service is okay  not the fastest but not the slowest Seating is limited They have a bizarre sign no loitering  30min max
15644,3,Never a delay when I use the drive through Cant wait until they are done with the remodeling of the play area
4289,3,At this location you have to wait a long time for your food its usually cold and Ill sign the garbage cans are so full no one empties them out dont like that
4290,3,Traditional run of the mill McDonalds The food and staff and everything was what I expected of a McDonalds Im not personally a huge fan of McDonalds but if you are this place would be great I imagine Also dont forget to use their app they have so many great coupons and offers on it so you can get free stuff
15640,3,Took forever in drive thru
287,3,Usually they they have the best coffee but yesterday it was watery and not that good
286,3,Order was wrong French fries were cold and too salty milk shake was melted
19643,3,Its ok
4306,3,Staff was very fast the French Frys needed more salt
22761,3,Very clean and fast room to sit
22764,3,Busy and they missed up the order twice
30105,3,The team had no personality and had even had one employee on his cell phone while making orders  The food I got had the fries lukewarm yet the burgers were fine  They were more concerned with talking with themselves and not the customer  Outside of that the place was clean and recieved my order in a quickly manner
285,3,One refill per visit no ice cream ever the crew employees are professional though
4278,3,Its a McDonalds Nothing amazing Wasnt too clean but I gave it 3 stars cuz my vanilla shake was made quickly and tasted better than normal
33160,3,Good
15652,3,Food was typical McDonalds Had to wait several minutes while one lady ran around taking cars of a busy drive thru while the other workers were nowhere to be seen
4267,3,This place was okay it wasnt crowded and the food was very fresh is nice quiet place to sit and eat
19352,3,I honestly cant believe they gave me a cinnamon bun this stale 
15677,3,Inconsistent in ther preparation of food and pricing  Instead of charging for meat substitution I was charged like I was adding additional meat
4229,3,I had the fries and coffee They were good
15670,3,I mean its McDonalds 
15668,3,I have a questionCan I work here of 20 years old
4235,3,Its fine I love the seat setup I just dont understand why the upstairs is always closed This is one of those places that usually has ice cream
30142,3,If I was rating this on speed of service it would be negative stars but the food was good once we got it This location is extremely busy and feels under staffed for the amount of business they get What is the point of all the kiosks and a double lane drive through if it overwhelms the staff and you wait for 3040 minutes for a 10pc mcnugget meal
19647,3,Food too cold
4250,3,My food was delicious but they did mess up my order The bathroom was so nasty and there is nowhere to put your stuff while you hover over the piss covered seat
30136,3,Well just because that McDonalds is on international drive which is in the tourist area doesnt give him the right to jack up their prices and I go up and down international drive quite a bit I drive charter buses and because their prices are jacked up so high I wont bring a busload of people there now the young lady that brought my lunch out you know she was very very friendly very nice young lady the restaurant is clean but your prices are way too high and until they come down I will not bring 50 60 people in my bus to that location just because youre on international drive dont mean you can rip people off and thats all youre doing when I can take them four miles down the road to a Burger King and their prices are a lot lot lower so if you want to start seeing more charter buses come in there with people lower your prices
4253,3,The usual steady consistency in their coffee and brew fresh when asked Its not the best but brew fresh and stronger than DD any day
30133,3,"I was here a couple times during a week I would say it has been pleasant service as expected But man Saturday was not normal Trash bins over flowing tables dirty self help machines missing table locator and drink dispenser area was messy From what I could see the back looked cleaned but the front of the house was a wreck

Back to the self help machines it states that they will bring you the drink to your table They brought me the food but told me to get the cup up front I dont really care but someone should change what the machine states

Overall this is a modern looking McDonalds Most of the days I went here it has been good But I guess their weekend was a different story"
294,3,Not as fast as youd like sometimes but still And cheaper than some of the other McDonalds around
15657,3,Food is what you expect from McDonalds Trashcan by playground door smells of dirty diapers or rotten milk the last few times I have been here Android pay is hit or miss here
4266,3,I dont think I will be going to the 1st Ave and 14th street location any time soon  Too many people just sitting around occupying space without ordering and I saw individuals walk in and  walk up to the sofa machine with their own cup and serve themselves soda and walk out One guy came in with a bag from KFC containing 2 buckets and 4 boxes with a cup and take soda from the machine and walk out  Crazy
33261,3,"Ice cream the air is so strong that it doesnt let you stay to eat something
Orders are made with a machine if one is a foreigner as in my case it is not fast enough and others wait
I totally rescue the attention of a dispatcher ROBERT attentive and speaks both Spanish and English it was what best stayed in my memory"
33263,3,Excellent atention But the bathrooms are very neglected and the waste containers were completely full and there was no space for more That part looks bad
19365,3,Service is very decent not too fat but not too slow
22121,3,"Located at the beginning of the strip McDonald type with attention 247
It does not have the best attention but it is not bad either its accesses are comfortable as well to leave the premises
In the rear sector it has parking to park and eat your order or wait"
16705,3,Pretty good as far as McDonalds go
16586,3,Go to this McDonald  regularly  most of the time they forget something  straw napkin sauce  etc
1172,3,Slow service in drive thru
21185,3,They are way under staffed but staff that is there is awesome
2007,3,"Im here with my children to enjoy the indoor play area However  there is a manager male with earnings in both ears for identification purpose only who is extremely rude to the employees in front of customers
He definitely need some business advice and a lot of common sense  My 9 year old wanted to know why he is so upset at everyone Whoever you are please dont ruin your customers mood Im compelled to post this Sad"
1169,3,What can I really say about Mickey D
2013,3,They renovated this place for no reason The staff forgot things in my order and not to mention that I had to wait long for simple stuff while people who came after me got their food and left They gave my daughters the wrong toy and forgot food items
2014,3,The service was fast maybe a little to fast They didn
2015,3,I order from grubhub here regularly today Iam absolutely shocked that there was a Large Coca Cola drink missing from my Double QP Meal Iam absolutely Shocked and surprised at how Dumb these McDonalds employees can be if you Fail to Put a Drink In a Combo meal Order you should definitely not be working in Fast Food you need help and Iam absolutely stunned at this whoever prepared my meal today and Failed to put my Large Coke definitely has the mindset of a Medieval Wagon Donkey

21194,3,Very busy and took a while to get food Many homeless in and around
2022,3,Standard McDonalds staff does not care and does not give you the time of day If you are in a rush you may want to think of something else to eat as it takes forever even if you go through drive through If you ask for extra sauce any more than 2 expect to pay additional charges
2026,3,staff were very nice got my order right however the people that are usually in there are just so obnoxious youre probably better off eating outside or taking it to go
32623,3,Ran out of apple pies however in place they let me have any treat I wanted off the menu sweet deal
20434,3,Yall took more than 15 minutes i was late to work
21199,3,Walked across the street from the Mandalay bay Trying to get a quick inexpensive bite Got there and it looked like it was closed A guy in front says you can use the drive thru No car A guy came out and said to use the side door Went in and no person at the counter  Figured out you have to order from a kiosk Then trying to order on kiosk  people inside say just enter 111 as the umbrella I guess thats the table you are sitting at I guess I need to know the system
2005,3,The food is okay when youre on the run But I just walked into the mens room and had to run out For an establishment that maintains a healthy profit they absolutely need to update their 19th Century restroom accommodations And come up with a maintenance schedule
2004,3,This place is great  you could order anything EXCEPT Milkshake Everytime i order milkshake for my friend at whatever hour it always ALWAYS breaks down and they ask me if i wanted something else Im like  No my friend is looking forward to that  But i had a feeling something like this is gonna happen I just wish if the manager can order a repair on their machine Its getting a bit ridiculous for something like this to happen everytime i order So no Im not happy
2000,3,The staff is horrible I have a problem almost every time I go and its always the staff Especially the managers
1176,3,its fine

What do you want me to say Bathroom was clean service had a minimal amount of angst and my order was correct and prompt

They probably deserve a higher minimum wage"
21165,3,"It is a McDonalds what do you expect  I could write endlessly of minute details relating to cleanliness and quality of staff product etc but it really wouldnt be of any value

Truly of all of the McDonalds I have ever been to this is most certainly one of them

Not gourmet but you wont die"

2042,3,I almost always use the drivethru and English is my first language and Im born in New York City That being said numerous times I have been unable to understand the other person in the booth and they cannot understand me Sometimes it is faulty intercom issues itself But often it is someone in the booth who does not understand or speak English properly This is highly frustrating when I have to repeat my order as much as six times Yeah I said six times Last weekend  it was an Indian kid  who I could not for the life of me understand And he could not understand me A polite enough kid when I reached the booth but seriously frustrating experience Other times its someone who does speak the language properly or a close facsimile LOL but they are distracted by their phone When I finally reach the booth to pay often and usually female LOL the cashier is thumbing through her phone McDonalds needs to set some standards for the people who work the drive thru If you are face to face with a cashier with language issues its easier to deal with but Dont put these people on the Drive through intercom By the way the food is just fine there No issues on that end LOL work it out Mickey d

2128,3,I only use the drive thru here They never give you a receipt unless you ask
2132,3,Food is great as always you can never go wrong with McDonalds but the bathrooms and the playground were not that clean in this location 
20393,3,I usually dont lower myself to Micky Ds food but I was here and hungry so figured one burger from here wouldnt kill me As long as your expectations arent too high the food is okay just sad though what Micky Ds and Burger King and the others have done to the Great American Hamburger If you look around you can get better food and service The only burgers worse than Micky Ds are the soy burgers you get out of vending machines And as long as you dont ask for anything special theyll make you a burger but I asked for one without onions and catsup and naturally they couldnt even get that right A crappy burger with crappy service what a wonderful meal BTW if you want to find The Great American Hamburger as it should be go to Fuddruckers
32673,3,Customer service needs to improve Especially The drivethrough area
2135,3,Not friendly staff Always have a wrong order
32677,3,Unorganized and slow but atleast they got the order right
32671,3,Food was good but the mens restroom was being cleaned for a long time and multiple men walked away or used the womens restroom
1113,3,"Slow for fast food
And milk shake machine is always down"
1087,3,Good food but really long wait
2164,3,It was the end of the school day alot of teenagers chasing each other through the place s reaming yelling bumping into people acting like thugs Management did nothing
21302,3,Clean store with good food for a McDonalds  Problem is the service  They have technology for kiosk ordering and delivery to the table but then were yelling at customers because they didnt realize that they were too busy for table service and werent ready to pick up the orders at the counter  Poor form
1050,3,They have a fireplace that they never use so its always freezing Maybe put some heat on
2204,3,Charged me for one thing and I recived another because the cashier was rushingnot nice The food as usual
31857,3,Long wait Cold hard fries and fish sandwich

31852,3,Friendly people service great
18603,3,As American as it gets
21315,3,3 stars because the location looks rundown Also they only gave us 1 napkin for everything we ordered Other customers were complaining about the same thing

18614,3,Slow
2215,3,They can never get your order right
32688,3,Its Miami Florida McDonalds is 100 better than  silver city NM McDonalds
17545,3,An average McDonalds that messes up your order occasionally
1057,3,If they got my order correct Id be shocked
18578,3,Its McDonalds  What else can you say
20383,3,There is a lack of customer service The food comes out fast but not always right There is a lack of care for customers to get all that they need in condiments
18580,3,Meh
1078,3,Made me wait in the annoying end of the sidewalk spot only to give me cold food and a watered down iced coffee

2183,3,8 times out of 10 there will be missing something from your order when going through drive thru
20372,3,Nicely furnished as most modern McDonalds are  The food is standard faire  Breakfast is average After breakfast is edible if you can dodge the petrocheese  They usually get orders right typically the only issue Ive found with this one is they occasionally will omit something from the bag
17552,3,Service was very slow
2185,3,Just okay the place was clean but the attendant wants to me to order from the kiosk and I wanted to be a real person and talk to a real person at a register she would not let me send it was not a good experience
32697,3,service was slow dinning closed

18334,3,Went for the kids play area It smelt musty and like mildew Kinda gross But the  again its McDonalds so my expectations werent super high
18232,3,The food was McDonalds typical I like the new design but as many of them Ive been to lately are it was just filthy I was there for over an hour and a half letting my kids eat and play and not once did I see anyone clean a table or anything off the floor It would also be helpful for there to be napkins in the play area so you could clean up messes without leaving your kids or taking the whole crew with you

18253,3,Its McDonalds  Double drive thru Good service  McDonalds menu Nice triple window different way to service when busy seems to speed things up So if your racing 114 to work Its a block through the parking lot or South down 377 mess in traffic if heavy use the parking lot entrance to the same menu you see coast to coast and around the globe

21888,3,busy location with a slow line

3051,3,Customer service was pretty good fast professional  efficient As for the breakfast order I made it left MUCH to be desired It was a value meal with bagel egg cheese coffee  hash brown The bagel with egg wouldve been fine alone What ruined it for me was the 2 layers on the sandwich of what was supposed to be the  cheese it was vile The cheese tasted like Cheez Wiz which I TOTALLY despise To salvage as much of the sandwich as I could I scraped off the cheese

22992,3,Had a confrontation with the girl in charge of taking drive thru orders she took care of 3 cars in the left lane before taking care of us right lane then when I called her out on it she started yelling at me this was around 10am The manager took over and was very professional the order was taken correctly and nicely by the manager
23089,3,Absolutely the worst service I have ever had at a Mcds The place was busy and lacked the peoplesystem to handle it Customers angry having to wait so long for food while others had to return theirs because of inaccurate orders It took me 20 minutes to get a simple order  one chicken wrap with sweet tea
24653,3,"This McDonalds has kiosk only ordering Its a good idea you order grab a number and sit down If you are getting a  to go order they tell out your name  I wish there was a more modern way to know your order is ready
A pager or digital board instead of someone telling out names"
7994,3,Good food but employees seem bothered to help you service was non existent
12723,3,I dont care for this place But my daughter love it
27466,3,Its insane how McDonalds now announces there burgers are now real beef Hmmm big problems have now surfaced with child obesity  Their food is good but usually your order will be wrong or short of something  Bring on the robots Starting with Corporate
27460,3,The food was fresh but of course it should be during lunch hour the staff couldnt keep up with the flow of customers coming in They handed me the wrong order which had a triple cheeseburger on it which i ate with no regret instead of the two cheeseburger meal i ordered
12718,3,Their food is pretty standard for McDonalds The employees are friendly The service is consistently slow
24656,3,Stopped in here on January 24th 2018 and ordered at the counter a signature classic grilled signature sriacha chicken sandwich with an artisan bun Paid for my order and waited When my order was ready it was handed to me in a bagI asked for ketchup and proceeded to a table to enjoy my meal First off tge fries were crispy which I prefer but they were old and not at all indicative of the worlds best fries I took out my sandwich took bite and noticed sesame seeds in the box I Checked my receipt to confirm that my sandwich should gave had the artisan bun proceeded to the counter  to correct the problem with my order to be told tgey were out of artisan buns I was pissed and walked off I finished my meal went to refill my drink and spoke with a man in yellow shirt and tie behind the counter about how terrible that the one woman knew there were no artisan buns but the order taker at the register knew nothing about it as well as the girl who gave me my food Someone should have confirmed that the sesame seed bun would meet my approval And I notified him this kind of service was not indicative pf McDonalds and that I would be callong corporate The following day I contacted McDonalds corporate who passed on my complaint to the restaurant location I received a call from Rose who apologized for the problem with the order and asked that I come back and give them the opportunity to make tge meal properly per my request I stopped in on Friday January 26th and Emma made sure that the meal was prepared to the standards I believe McDonalds is known The sandwich was flavorful with the artisan roll and the fries were hot and fresh Thanks so much for taking the initiative to prepare my meal to the high quality McDonalds is known to deliver
12711,3,Never ordered food here We usually stop by to order the kids meals toys Its usually during Thier busy periods Staff is friendly though
12709,3,Customer service and the attitudes they have with customers needs work Great food  slow workers but other than that great atmosphere
8017,3,Another McDonalds with the same exact experience long wait cold food
8019,3,Food tasted funny but I had already drove away
24662,3,I give 3 cuz theyre advertising shamrock shakes and had none either byvway of being soldout or not participating
12703,3,Went through the drive thru food wasnt ready when I got to the window had to pull around and wait for half my order while waiting the other half got cold
27444,3,Its McDonalds  Double drive thru Good service  McDonalds menu Nice triple window different way to service when busy seems to speed things up So if your racing 114 to work Its a block through the parking lot or South down 377 mess in traffic if heavy use the parking lot entrance to the same menu you see coast to coast and around the globe
27443,3,Dont use the app  have your husband pick up unless he takes your device because they wont give you the food youve ordered AND paid for Never had a problem at this store until now THUMBS DOWN ON THE MCDS APP AND MANAGEMENT
12696,3,Id it wasnt for homeless person resting inside would be very good
12691,3,Sits on a street known for heavy prostitution Drug addicts hang around the parking lot and shopping center The cashiers are excellent They have security on hand The food is terrible though
8046,3,Line was out on the main highway and no room to maneuver once in drive thru
24669,3,food was nice and fresh though a couple of the workers where rude to customers and staff too which isnt good at all
27468,3,They were closed on new years eve and there was no sign put out The Google hours showed open couple of cars pulled up the drive through but no response and lights were on like they were in there
12730,3,Its okay for a quick bite but after 1am they only serve breakfast or at least thats what they told me at the one on Imperial and Figueroa
12731,3,Slow service on the Drive thru 21 min Waiting time just one car ahead of me at 11pm Why
7977,3,Really comes down to whos working You will either be surprised at the efficiency and general helpfulness of the staff or you will leave angry and long after you got there
27515,3,I used the drive through to order food before going to work Service was a little slower than usual but food was hot
27511,3,Manager waited on lacked enthusiasm Team member stocking lids napkins and straws didnt bother stepping aside for customers to get their articles needed
7892,3,Sometimes they are good and other times they are not worth spending you money they Most are nice BUT some do have attitudes
7894,3,The fries were undercooked they were soggy I got them around 12am other than that my nuggets were good
12775,3,It took just a little while longer to get my food ready but overall its okay
12773,3,Good food fast and fresh and friendly attitude
7913,3,Many stores are closed
12766,3,The drive thru is ALWAYS Long and takes 4ever REMODELED BUT STILL SLOW INSIDE AND OUT
7921,3,Restaurant was clean and food was hot Took four times to get a simple order right The manager was finally about to get it right
27436,3,This restaurant had an nice increase in customer service once new management took over at least I think it was new MGMT and a remodel Now however they seem to be sliding back into giving constant wrong orders not giving there sauces that they make you ask for dont forget to ask for ketchup at the window since they dont seem to want to take that part at the speaker  We are back into driving to the Southlake location to give them it money since they rarely get our order wrong  Thankfully we dont eat McDonalds that often anymore otherwise this review would be lower
27499,3,Its ok food wise mostly Ive had few issue with my coffee so I dont get coffee anymore there but the workers are very attentive and nice
7939,3,My Big Mac still tasted like a Big Mac but unfortunately the company has shrunk their burgers over the years
7940,3,This McDonalds smelled like pee
24642,3,"This McDonalds location is significantly updated on the interior featuring subway tile walls and designed seating  Also has several selforder kiosks However one staff member was very adamant about everyone both young and old using the self order kiosk which easily took longer and was less efficient than than ordering at the counter

One plus to this location is the plentiful parking lot behind the building"
24647,3,They ran out often get here early if you want a full selection  Otherwise nice staff and clean restrooms
12744,3,Dining was closed service was real slow with two lanes

12676,3,Damn good coffee Cant digest 2 for 400 sausage and egg on English Muffin Too much old grease on sausge and egg
8148,3,2 for 3 is s great deal
27362,3,Very slow waited over 20 minutes for a Big Mac and medium fries
8153,3,"The new chicken fingers were
great"
8154,3,Drive thru takes too long Always long line
24683,3,I decided to eat here late at night around 1130 during a leadership conference at the Hilton Orlando hotel down the street Quite a few people had the same idea as I did to eat late At least 30 people had ordered and were waiting for food Very tight space to move around during a busy time Very unorganized and waited 30 minutes to get my food
8166,3,Some stuff was missing and wasnt cooked right
12616,3,Even with 2 lines for drive thru takes to long I was on line around 20 to 30 minutes
8173,3,Great cashier lousy service
27340,3,The toilets clogged the restaurant not top in cleanliness
8140,3,Employees too loud and some costumers wasnt happy about it
24687,3,Often gets extremely busy and staff cannot handle it Good food Mixed service Jose very friendly Cleanliness good
27332,3,A lot of homeless come in to ask for money
8183,3,Everything was good
24689,3,Theyre pretty fast didnt have to wait in a parkingspot for the food like at many other McDonalds They had it ready at the window But the fries were luke warm and stale
8185,3,They didnt have coke
27325,3,I did not like the format of the store the bathroom is kept closed
27323,3,The person who took my order was not very friendly I hadnt even finished ordering and told mehave a nice day
27312,3,Its McDonalds
27310,3,Its McDonalds
27306,3,Its McDonalds
8178,3,Rarely get my orders right
12783,3,Busy place Love the customer service the managers could help the crew sometime
27371,3,The play area is nice and clean Food was normal not bad just regular McDonalds food The place was clean except the bathroom in the play area
8137,3,Sometimes its good eat at Mc DONALDS
12675,3,This McDonald is horrible I bought a quarter pounder with cheese and the meat was not cooked I went back the next day for breakfast a sausage mcmuffin with egg The top was the mcmuffin top and the bottom was a bisquit
8064,3,Messed up our order for the 3rd time  McDonalds is going down hill
27427,3,Places was small and overloaded was given the wring drinks due to not having propper amounts of staff The Terminals were all also down One good thing the food was hot tastey and bathrooms were open
12672,3,Really dirty but the employees are very nice
12670,3,Its always crowded and the food quality gets lost I rather wait than have food thats not nowhere near good
27423,3,The food was McDonalds typical I like the new design but as many of them Ive been to lately are it was just filthy I was there for over an hour and a half letting my kids eat and play and not once did I see anyone clean a table or anything off the floor It would also be helpful for there to be napkins in the play area so you could clean up messes without leaving your kids or taking the whole crew with you
12663,3,I typically buy drinks only from McDs  The app allows me to get a lot of deals if I decide buy food However I wish the quality of the food was healthier
27411,3,This Micky Ds is pretty standard The usual menu options staff is quick and polite they generally get your order right However I am only giving 3 stars because they recently changed their hours and the location is only open until 11 PM daily This used to be a reliable place for an extremely late night snack but not anymore Even the local Wendys and Taco Bell are open later
12661,3,Very nice staff They just forgot our order
24680,3,Dude got my order wrong asked for the double fish but got a single I didnt notice until I got back to my hotel He did seem new so
8097,3,"Typical McDonalds
No sauce for the nuggets though requested
No ketchup for the fries

On the up side service was friendly and smiling"
8098,3,good quick service when i was there in and out very fast
12654,3,They remodeled this McDonalds and they tried but the neighborhood in the area is just to get all The staff tries its best but the people who live in the area just trash this McDonalds so bad Everytime I go there I never dinein I take my food to go its so bad in there
8101,3,Service was a bit slow but I was there at a late hour
27405,3,So I gave this a 3 mainly because they always get my order right The customer service is not always there Its hit or miss Please Beware The drivethru has a narrow turn Ive seen too many cars scrape up the side hitting the barrier at the first window It doesnt look like youre that close but I promise just take a wide turn in the drivethru
12650,3,I Just wish  When I asked for ten Sugars  I can get 10 sugars in my coffee one day it tastes like I aint have none then the next that tastes like they put too much now I can seriously say when I go to McDonalds they put 10 sugars it tastes just right
27401,3,When the order is correct the quality is fine But I never get an order completely correct especially if its a McCafe drink I would let it go everyone makes mistakes but its constant and employees as a manager have had a terrible attitude about fixing it If there were another one to go to instead I would
27382,3,I went their today got a double quarter pounder meal got a double hamburger meal
24678,3,I stopped in this McDonalds because it was on my way home The manager did not want to help me and kept sending me to the kiosk to place my order Now i was looking to ask a question but she turned around and didnt even want to acknowledge that I was there and kept telling the other workers i had to go to the kiosk  If there isnt anyone available to help answer a question there should be a phone to pick up and ask for help She was so rude
8134,3,Regular Mc Kind employees same food you lovehate
12659,3,The worst costumer service ever on the drive thru cxs have to wait up to 12hr or more its been like that always and the general mngr never does anything about it always long lines and to top it of bad CX service specially by a Lady that most of the times takes orders in the 3 yrs Ive known this place the only thing that has change is the decor nothing else
27304,3,Its McDonalds
12789,3,Its ok but the speaker doesnt work so good 
7854,3,"If you want consistency eat here
Fries soaked in oil and still dripping Service as low as can be I really think the staff here stopped trying"
27708,3,Service was nice would feel more comfortable if people were sitting at the table eating Like family
7553,3,Slow as molasses
12911,3,Very long lines training new staff but pleasant interaction overall
27693,3,Its McDonalds You already know what you want if youre going there 
12906,3,I just come here to get happy meals for my kids
12905,3,The soda Cola taste like water every time I come here
27686,3,Their quarter pounders and big macs are great But they have to cook fresh fren fries twice I went and their fries were cold
7580,3,Just another M
7581,3,Friendly staff

7589,3,Good  place
7590,3,Slow as death
7595,3,Busy place
7597,3,OK
7599,3,Typical McDonalds
24576,3,Ordered my food of four items and they did not have my order right the first time  Still the selforder kiosks do have some getting used to and they dont have the option to pay cash have to go to the cashier  Food was good
12893,3,Food is the same just like at any other McDonalds
7603,3,Kinda seedy
7604,3,Its McDonalds
27709,3,Take to l text too long to the drive thru when certain people are there who speaks English you get the order much faster I probably they have an understanding problem
7545,3,Ok
7544,3,Ok
12920,3,Ok for a quick bite attendance are kind slow
7484,3,Good but dry
27770,3,What a wild location Went here twice while on vacation and each time there were police near by People darting across the parking lot
7487,3,Its a McDonalds Just like the other million
27766,3,I had small issues with drive thru but after we figured some of it out together with another employee helping Took a bit after the fries were cold ect Thought they would of remade them for us but it was not the worse it could of been I should of ask them to do that asked for more help and would of went better probably
7492,3,Ok place
24554,3,Slow no one is ever quick to assist Recommended i go to kiosk every visit Restroom was filthy lobby and fries were made fresh twice was burnt looking coming out of the oil Nasty coffee It was ok Oh mananger was rude no thank you after i said thank you
7500,3,Its ok
7504,3,Its ok
24558,3,Dirtiest McDonalds weve ever been in but the food was fine  Delayed flight so this was the only thing open at 3 am The lobby was open and someone was in the process of cleaning it she was friendly too You can only order at a kiosk which was new to us
27667,3,Prices are high Apple pies were old and stale They exchanged them but they were all so bad So they baked new ones for me
12946,3,They gave me the wrong food
27754,3,Food isnt always hit Nonmatter when I go And even if I order a kids meal we always have to pull around and wait for our order Its very slow service
12942,3,Mc Donalds is good for some things when you are in a rush
12941,3,McDonalds has some great fries and great fish fillet
12940,3,The staff was a bit rude and the tables were dirty
7524,3,Its open 24hrs
27728,3,I spend a lot of money here everyday and today me and a friend came here for breakfast The water for my tea was hot but her coffee was cold Do better I would have given a higher star rating if her coffee was hot and made properly
12932,3,The food is good customer service is okay
7534,3,Ok service
24566,3,We went here for breakfast The place could have been cleaner and the staff seemed a bit clueless they missed the coffee from our order and also missed some items from the order of people sitting next to us Youd be much better off going to Friendlys or Dunkin Donuts on International Drive
27756,3,"Tiny cramped parking lot makes it hard to get in and out of Location is in a really commercial touristy area so its to be expected I suppose Didnt go inside so this is just the drive thru experience Dual drive thru lines were wrapped around the building at 10pm on a Sunday
Food ok Fries and fish bun were a bit stale considering the long line was expecting fresher food I guess  Good enough for a late snack"
7606,3,Basic McDonalds
7612,3,Just McDonald
7615,3,"For the first time I noticed that drinks can be refilled freely
It was hard to tell where the tomato ketchup came out
20190219 Ordered an egg McMuffin Same taste all over the world"
27573,3,If youre turning left into the parking lot its a pain due to traffic blocking entrance Employee at drive thru asked us to pull over to the side to wait for our order but since there was already a car there she said we need to go to the otherside that means we have to pull out and turn back in It was already a pain to get in the first place and now we have to do it again My husband refused and said well just wait right there at the window Need to come up with a better system than that Other than that ordeal our food was hot fries were fresh They failed to put tartar sauce on my kids filet o fish sandwich though

27553,3,Extremely frantic McDonalds for no reason They make people park instead of waiting at the drive thru The line is minimal and happens at every single fast food place you can th
7771,3,This location is adequate The staff are generally nice The place is nice looking and inviting Unless the food is super freshoffthegrill it doesnt warrant the increases in price the last few years If you want to eat cheap and slightly more healthy Id recommend Subway in the strip mall behind McDs
7790,3,The guest ambassador  was watching us while we ate it was kinda nerve racking  and annoying  food can be fresh at times  butthen again  it depends on who is working
7731,3,Neutral
7792,3,I ordered 2 cheese burgers and a fry The fries were good The burgers were wrong They put them in cheese burger wrappers but never added the cheese
7811,3,They were ok Fast st drive through but my breakfast sandwiches always seem to be far less hotter than my hash browns  It makes not want to eat it
7825,3,You know what you get for food Good Today no one was paying attention Line backed up while cashier was helping confused customer manager came to help Then left Two customers left and  no one knew it Suggested to cashier another register should have opened Only the one she was on was opened Seemed to be lots of staff Just saying 
7831,3,This location will park you for 15 minutes when youve only ordered 2 items This forces me to order for pick up most times so I dont have to wait 15 minutes Otherwise food is okay
7832,3,I only give 3 stars because i was supposed to have an interview July 10th and the manager doing my interview was on vacation and no one called to reschedule or inform meand when the manager came back from vacation i was still not contactedvery unprofessional But food order is always accurate 
7840,3,As an employee of McDonalds I usually give them the benefit of the doubt but the nuggets we ordered were fried together making them raw in the middle and still served  And never in a my years of working for McDonalds have I ever had undercooked fries that tasted hours old
7844,3,The cashier was super nice but I received the wrong item at the drive thru My chocolate chip frappe did not seem to have a lot of chips in it Overall the drinks and food were good though

12882,3,If were talking about the Mickey Ds on Wilmingtonno comment shut this place down
24586,3,Not gonna lie this one was a little rough It was hard to tell what was going on but after waiting 15 minutes in the drive thru without any movement I went inside and waited 20 mins more Apparently there was some security issue involving the police Either way I was there way longer than I wanted to be and the fries had 0 things of salt on them
24587,3,Can only order from the Kiosk but no tells you that  No in restaurant dinning Saturday night was very busy and the people waiting seem very unhappy There were no real human interaction just order number 1786

8422,3,The atmosphere in general is good They should improve the issue of bathrooms very dirty
24810,3,Place to small Lot of people not enough seating Workers are great and have A LOT stress Place pretty clean considering all the people
24869,3,Slow got the order wrong and placement looked a bit dirty on the inside The food was good however
8468,3,"Its okay being in downtown slc homelessness is a problem and being approached by homeless people and angry drivers is not uncommon The wait was long almost 15 minutes for 2 drinks I understand it can be hard with big crowds on employees

510 Its a McDonalds so hit it up if your looking for food in the area fast food doesnt get much better than this in slc"
12329,3,Not very friendly
8563,3,The only thing I gets from this place is iced vanilla coffee however sad to say I always have to go back just to let them know that they need to put some more flavor in their iced coffees cuz they are completely BLAND Other than that food is always served hot  fresh except were ALWAYS cheated out on our French fries We order large but they give us huge cartons half filled
12271,3,Kiosk wouldnt work

12243,3,There are better ones out there
8605,3,New Crispy Chicken was dry and no pickles Tomatoes were end pieces I get that its fast food but take some pride in what you serve rather than trying to move the drive through line
24946,3,Nice remodeling but restrooms are a mess cheap soap and no air freshener Food is MCD so you know what to expect
24952,3,They sometimes mess up my order but the employees are nice and courteous
8607,3,One time I found throw up in their slide I always feel like McDonalds is not clean and very professional Everytime I go there the chairs are sticky Their food is pretty much fake Their hamburgers are tiny and the bread is always soggy
8610,3,Something happened to their Coke  Either the mix is off or they changed a hose   Either way it is half as good as it once was   Bummer 
12227,3,Never gets the order right
24958,3,Generally clean and the service is usually relatively quick I notice a tendency to overcook the fries though
8618,3,Friendly and helpful but just kinda monotone like the environment of the restaurant Not bad but nothing special
8601,3,Super disappointed that breakfast isnt all day long anymore which sucks This isnt the best mcdonalds around thats for surestaff is kind of rude and has their music blaring Also i was waiting for my food and one of the workers came up and asked if i was waiting for someone like it was a problem i was there Only go here if i absolutely have tolast resort for sure I rather go to a location further from my house to get better service
27068,3,This place is sooo busy all the time
8552,3,This is THE absolute slowest McDs in Salt lake City hands down If it wasnt such a long wait Damn near almost ran out of gas waiting for my 1 hot n spicy sandwich with a medium fry No Joke This would probably be a pretty good McDonalds if theyd learn to put some more pep in their step
12285,3,Well this is a McDonalds fast food place 
8470,3,Food is always good but theyre very rude when speaking on the phone I called to see when the dining area was open and the lady just gave me a very blunt rude response I said thank you and have a good day but she just hung up
8481,3,This McDonalds is ok when service is concerned They also have automated services where you can place your orders and the food comes out really fast but the place was a bit dirty especially the restrooms
8487,3,Food was good however I ordered cheese on a hot n spicy Mc chicken They charged me for the cheese but didnt put it on my sandwich  Other than that all was good
26994,3,Be careful with drive thur they can forget you suff
12316,3,Food is getting worse by the day
26992,3,Pretty fast service and good family pack
8500,3,This McDonalds location struggles to pur out decent food reliability or quickly The line is generally long and slow food comes out cold
12312,3,Nothing special except for cheap coffee
12311,3,You always know what to expect
12283,3,Cost more than youd expect
26989,3,Good service unfortunately only 2 restrooms
8520,3,Busy place not too ghetto But the McRib is not that good and they gave me a medium fries that is smaller than a small fries
8523,3,I dont know that happened to this business Service and food has fallen through the floor Prices are climbing so we got that going for us 
26983,3,Excellent coffee but prices are increasing
26979,3,Long lines lately outside on drive thru inside slow toi
26978,3,Not great Lots of neerdowells hang out there Be weary travellers
24900,3,Standard McDonalds experience  However I went in for breakfast Tuesday morning The seating area which had social distancing tables separated and identified and the chain had been lowered so you could enter so I and my friend sat After sitting for 2 minutes a staff member standing on the other side of the restaurant started yelling at us and indicated that we werent allowed to sit there and that the dine in portion of the restaurant was closed They need to work on their signage it felt rude
26975,3,No matter how many McDonalds I visited in Los Angeles County they all have the same problem  filthy bathrooms 
12293,3,They are not 24hrs They close at 11pm
12291,3,Service and food was great

27186,3,Long wait
12507,3,Drive thru line was extremely long so I went inside Ordered at kiosk but it didnt  print my receipt so I didnt know my order  Waited about 15 minutes for a sausage egg mcmuffin and small OJ Several customers were waiting inside At one point the only cashier at the front walked away for about 5 minutes Customers coming in and asking for help but no one came out Finally got my order and it was barely warm OJ had something floating around in it but I was already running behind so I just threw it away on my way out Never going back to this one
27181,3,Thank you Elastrada 
12503,3,Clean space OK service only downfall is theres missing items from the order and this has happened several times at this location  I ordered a meal and they almost forgot the drink that comes with it I had to ask for it I got home checked the bag and no fries in the bag only the burger was in the bagdis

12560,3,I told her exactly what I wanted but she still somehow took the wrong order Not only that but when I told her this is not what I asked for she said yes it is instead of just saying okay let me fix the order The people who work here need a better attitude towards their customers

24296,3,"Typical service But its mcdonalds so dont expect too much Intercom person was rushing but got upset when we asked to repeat our order We were just making sure it was placed right

Fries were good as always Went before 1 so the lunch rush was over My big mac patties were dark instead of brown Couldnt eat it But lets hope your experience is better"
13361,3,This Mcds is so busy  I guess cuz its so cloe to Santa Monica Pier   Lots of people and lots of homeless people outside
6858,3,its bad customer  some need to be no tr allowed in this place
6859,3,Dirty place yet no complaints on the food
6860,3,I just went and brought ice cream I dont eat McDonalds
13357,3,Alright service but could use some more speed in handing out ordres with less aduittud
6837,3,There kiosks were broken and service extremely slow
13478,3,It was good but it gave me heartburn really bad
13481,3,Standard McDonalds For some reason they charge more for the apple pies than other locations Always a lot of homeless people camping out
13482,3,Constant fast food chain when they get your orders correct
6559,3,Its ok  The staff can be a bit more friendly to customers
6562,3,Food was good  service was shocking
6563,3,Food and service are good but pickpockets abound Be very alert or avoid the 8th Avenue  McDonalds near 34th street
6568,3,Busy prices higher than most McDonalds typical of the city Easy to find seating
6569,3,Great restaurant Lacks staff at certain hours to kick beggers out
13590,3,This place was HUGE  very busy All of the upstairs was a play jungle gym  an arcade along with some seating A very diverse menuthe usual but also fire oven pizza bad pasta Im giving it three because it was SO slow I know 
6575,3,Its been alright but there are times when they have vagrants hanging around making the place less pleasant to eat there
6576,3,Very crowded always Tough to find a seat Otherwise food is same as any other McDonalds
6579,3,Such an interesting crowd of regulars hang out here I go for my egg mcmuffin and to people watch
6556,3,The place is busy we needed to wait for a table and the bathrooms are a mess but for to solve a problem fast wirh food or bathroom is good
13584,3,The only reason i am giving this McDonalds a 3 is because of how dirty the bathrooms were The food was good and the arcade they had was fun I
28304,3,Sometimes we have to wait for the food for so long long lines cars at the drive thru
24151,3,53019  On the way back from all day at Universal Island of Adventures so decided on a cheaper meal to end the night Had dinner with family here Busy night but able to order our meals from the auto screens instead of counter and pay Cool since in Georgia they havent caught on at many yet Ordered several meals and customized my Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich meal to include bacon pickles and cheese and a large fry Service was great for me They managed to work around us and keep things clean in the eating areas and bathrooms Enjoyed the experience Went back for dessert but paid at the counter and let them know we appreciated the service
13580,3,It is called the largest McDonalds in the world Exterior looks great and interior as well Two storied building with play area for the kids Mainly because of the world famous universal studio and Disney park and the other tourist facilities this McDonalds is always busy However its not among the best in terms of service quality Long waiting for the order No matter you use the kiosk or go to the counter to order your food get prepared to wait longer than usual McDonald
28302,3,Food was good but be prepared for a long wait for your food It took 22 minutes from order to food receipt lunchtime on a Saturday
28300,3,This MacDonalds has not once given me the correct amount of nuggets Lately its been too many but there are several times where they short me Theyve gotten my order completely wrong before too They just seem to struggle a fair amount
6588,3,Was unable to order deals on the menu
13576,3,The aesthetic of this location was really cool There is a huge arcade inside as well as play area for kids Two floors tons of seating an aquarium and a bunch of other cool stuff I was expecting a little better service and food quality with it being the largest McDonalds in the country It was cool to be able to order pizza and pasta since that is not something typically available at McDonalds but as expected it wasnt incredibly flavorful Prices were a bit higher than normal McDonalds as well but with all the extras at the restaurant that makes sense
24156,3,"Very busy drive thru Cars were lined up literally around the building from pick up windows all the way to the front on the restaurant facing International Drive Informed at the window that they were out of food items we ordered and asked if we can order something else

However even though we had a big order everything was in the bag The food were also hot and fresh"
6593,3,Drug dealers and users right outside Although the was a security guard at the door it was not reassuring
6580,3,Its just ok for my kids I cant stand the atmosphere with the homeless hanging out there
13569,3,Nice location the food is terrible
24132,3,They would do a lot better if they didnt park every car in the drive thru I know they do this just to make their drive thru time look better to the higherups but it absolutely ridiculous  Simply process your orders faster and give customers their order Every time Ive been parked Ive ended up waiting 510 minutes When Im only ordering 1 or 2 combos it makes it a little asinine
6551,3,Regular vist I like the kiosk option
28346,3,Food  was hot and delicious service fast One bad apple  stop me from    Giving this location four or better
24056,3,Slow service food is cold
6510,3,My son enjoyed the milkshake but the AC wasnt working right Place was hot and uncomfortable
24065,3,Fast food whats therw to say
13643,3,"I realize this is a REALLY BIG and REALLY POPULAR location because it is unique My friend and I were only in town for a few days and this is something we wanted to experience

While there we figured that we would order something so we both got a dessert item my friend got a McFlurry and I got a Hard Ice Cream in a Waffle Cone

We ordered from the self serve kiosk for some reason the one we were at was not accepting payment not sure if the others were broken too So I went to the one counter that had an Employee and paid there since it was Ice Cream I was told that it would be available at the Ice Cream counter which made sense since thats where the Hard Ice Cream was

My friend and I waited quite awhile for a Staff Member to notice us standing there I say notice us since some came close but never looked over at us When one finally did I flagged her down she told us that she has not be told to come here then walked away

So I went to the main counter as I approached my number was being called from the main counter so I guess the Ice Cream counter was not the pick up location Ahh the McFlurry came from the main counter but the Hard Ice Cream was coming from the Ice Cream counter sure that makes sense I suppose

I head back over to the Ice Cream Counter and guess who reluctantly appears The young Female Employee who was now told to come over to serve me she DID NOT look impressed to be there After fighting with the sliding glass doors that cover the Hard Ice Cream for several minutes she finally got them open I had to point out the Rocky Road Ice Cream one small scoop was placed on the Waffle Cone and I was sent on my way Im not sure what it was supposed to look like since on the Kiosk it only shows an empty Waffle Cone with no option of its contents

It was an interesting place but based on this one visit I would likely not return unless it was much less busy"
13638,3,I dont know what I was expecting  Its a McDonald
13635,3,Really cool atmosphere  However lines are extremely long even  11 at night They have about 810 kiosks to make your order but only 1 was operational when I visited Prices were extremely high double the price for all menu items from my home state
6526,3,Was to crowded We went elsewhere
24078,3,Regular mc a deed
24129,3,Visited the worlds biggest McDonalds on international drive Pizza and burger ordered were great however had to wait over an hour for food as it was so busy Pizza also came first table delivery and advised remainder of the order would be delivered shortly Had to then ask again after around 15 minutes Order was quickly brought but believe this would have been forgotten if we had not asked Overall good was fine but service poor due to being so busy
24079,3,It
24087,3,Typical fast food place
6532,3,Bathroom needed to be clean more consistently  Cashiers were nice though
6536,3,"Skip this Mcdonalds unless you are about to fall out due to a low glycemic index
Food can be chewed with mouth Thats one pro I guess"
13616,3,This is a very unique location They offer pasta and pizza something you would not find at any other McDonalds They have a huge Play area for kids and a nice number of play machine la that requiere a play card Imagine some sort of chuck e cheese but in a 2 stories building Unfortunately it is just like many other McDonalds food is ok service is bad and place is a mess
6538,3,Their customer service was excellent as if you were at a fivestar 
13614,3,Awesome to be able to say I was at the biggest McDonalds in the world Its massive with multiple levels which includes a play area as well as an arcade with some Very cool games to 
6544,3,Just like any other McDonalds and thats a good thing You always know what you are going to get
6549,3,WellIts just convenient great location and food was ok
13605,3,This place can be such a Hotspot since its so special with having pasta pizza waffles and is so unique but compared to other McDonalds the taste of even a cheeseburger wasnt great The only highlight was the service the place was clean and the staff very attentive But good service alone is not enough of the burgers are bad
6528,3,Better service and security now so no more drug dealers and addicts taking over
28081,3,Included in my bill items I did not order
28295,3,This McDonalds is really hit or miss Ive had good experiences Ive had horrifically terrible experience But I dont expect much because the people are underpaid
28290,3,Horribleorder was all messed up I asked for my food to be freshly cookedI got cold fries
24206,3,The international drive McDonalds looks great but the play place was closed  this was the reason for bringing my kids  so this was a HUGE let down it was 7pm on a Sunday night when we went in the middle of a tourist city Too bad 
6672,3,This locationvery busy Had to return my food because is was cold and hard Ok service
6673,3,It a place you can get something quick to eat
13509,3,Omg no refill on drink and forgot my sons nuggets
13508,3,Busy place with good service Free Wifi for travellers
6674,3,Ok
13505,3,McDonalds is trash food you all know that
6676,3,Some of the workers there are too rude and unprofessional
13498,3,Not my favorite location Fairly sketchy with kids
6671,3,Too much mayo in one burger not fair and staff is not attentive takes time to deliver the order which is not great
13496,3,Food was good but it was very crowded
6697,3,Ok food Ok service Too many homeless people asking for 
24226,3,I mean its McDonalds not a five star restaurant so a generous 3 is what Im giving
6698,3,Place is great during the day After 8pm place is short staff and messy
28231,3,Food was good but it took 3540 mins to get it through drive thru
13487,3,Waited over 20min for 2 coffees The cash register issued a bad number
13486,3,Went for morning coffee and the cashier ladies are just wonderful
6702,3,I see they got security now to keep the homeless people from sleeping on the chairs that paying customers need to sit and eat
13484,3,Very busy very growded and not so tidy Staff was friendly
13483,3,Bitchen
6690,3,Clean neat place security guard was helping when I want to sit down in upstairs
13567,3,Super busy and messy Toilet required staff to open
24203,3,Its McDonalds you know what youre going to get before you get there This one is all kiosks
6661,3,same as the others as far as food patronwise lots of interesting characters in and around
13563,3,Better now theres less bums inside
13562,3,Your basic McDonalds experience
28289,3,Only visited once and drivethrough so dont know anything  about the place But they where friendly
6608,3,Could have better costumer service during the night hours
6609,3,Tables were dirty and system of calling orders made me feel like i was in a meat market
13551,3,Maybe its famous but I dont recommend it to you
13547,3,Can be real crowded at lunchtime doesnt take EBT cards
6616,3,This location is usually fairly comparatively but the staff is always professional
6619,3,Watch ur pocket and get the lowlife of there
6663,3,Needs to be kept cleaner especially as a place that sells food
13542,3,Busycould be slightly cleaner
6634,3,Ok
13533,3,Take to long
6640,3,Only go to Mc donalds for the ATM the food is garbage Atm is free depending on your bank
28268,3,kiosks ordering in full effect  take a number and sit down to wait
28262,3,Long wait for food Sunday at 1240 pm  We ordered from the kiosk  We waited longer than people in line  Food was good
13527,3,How do yall run out of spicy chicken sandwiches
6649,3,Good service nice looking but infested with junkies  weirdos
28261,3,Staff is currently learning their job While waiting for my food the had to correct orders for  4 people
6657,3,To many homeless people coming in begging
6629,3,Its a mcdonalds You know what you are going to get  This one had more than it fair share of homeless and you had to queue to get the key for the bathroom
12221,3,Not too bad for fast food
6940,3,One of the best places to eat
6947,3,Its okay but not good for you
13076,3,Food was good jt was crowded there was gum in my chair didnt notice til i got up and it was all over my shorts
13075,3,This McDonald tourist city attraction restaurant is over rated by its local customers  During my visit to this restaurant none of its employees had people skills or customer dissatisfaction resolution skills  Its employees escalated its customers verbal complaints to verbal challenging arguments  Without any complaint resolution
13074,3,This is a very convenient location Probably the most affordable food in this area near the pier Its usually very busy with foot traffic for the beach and the promenade You will encounter all types from international tourist to local bums Its fairly clean considering the large amount of customers The orders are quick but be sure to check it before leaving Not the most accurate employees
7315,3,Its fast foodwhat do you expect
7316,3,Meh Not enough staff to serve the busy morning rush
7317,3,It
13067,3,Bathrooms are very dirty and lines are very poorly organized I was able to skip ahead of at least ten people that were ahead of me because they dont communicate the registers that are open to the customers The booths in the far side of the restaurant smell like cigarettes Food was served quickly and with good quality however
24485,3,We used the kiosks to order and pay for the food You are supposed to take a number and sit down and they will bring you your food We had to wait for numbers She told me theyve had those kiosks for at least 8 months The staff was overwhelmed with the amount of orders We had to get the food ourselves from the counter My poor mom had to wait in the line because she couldnt make the kiosk work She was so stressed out by the time she sat down
13065,3,I usually give high reviews but not this time The service is excellent Fast and professional staff all the way Truely representing McDonalds culture Unfortunately there is an issue with homeless people that brings this location down The restroom has a bad odor because of the homeless people washing up in there The restroom door doesnt close as to see whats going on in there such as drug use I can only speculate There are plenty of homeless people going in and out of the establishment to eat and use the restroom So they carry a bad odor It ruins the atmosphere Its depressing I witnessed a homeless man get hauled out by Santa Monica Police for lounging around not purchasing any food and being loud and unruly I applaud the quick response of the security officer on duty who immediately asked the man to leave several times always maintaining his composure even as the homeless man escalated Its a tough job but its getting done The priorities are kept here Customer satisfaction and safety are key to the staff and it shows
24490,3,Wait was not too long at all Line moved evenly Although order was incorrect and corrected It took a long time to get 1 drink
7331,3,Need to update the menu because its missing the breakfast items and the numbers Other than that its McDonalds
7335,3,Burgers are better now the frys are still great
24493,3,"As I do not nor have I ever cared for McDonalds my wife really enjoys coffee I tried there coffees as I was not blown away I will not be so quick in the future to pass up another location if need a special cup of Joe

We did not eat any food  Location was clean Staff was typical young peeps wishing they were anywhere but there"
13054,3,The new renovation it went through makes it look more modern The ordering kiosks are perfect for the tourist that cant speak English or Spanish It is very spacious Please beware not to their fault the Homeless population can be a turn off to go their do to the fact that its a hang out spot for them I have no problem with that as long as they mind their own business and I do the same One thing that Im surprised about No refills on my coffee Really That was one of the main reasons I went there for breakfast Besides that its McDonalds we are taking about Quick and easy meal compare to other higher price options around
7341,3,This is an expensive McDonald
7343,3,Typical Micky Ds  Inattentive service Luke warm burger and cold french fries
7347,3,Delivery speed is not quick for drive through
13047,3,Long lines rude staff you ask for sauce but never get it They only have one register open Homeless at front entrance smoking blunts and can smell it while you are ordering
7353,3,Always good for a quick bite to eat
27913,3,This location Is usually clean but not much Front counter assistance Longest wait was 3 minutes
27917,3,The park was amazing LOVED IT but the bus exit for the parking lot was HORRIBLE  Needs to be designed choreographed and thought out better
13085,3,It is an OK place to go if you do not have a better option The prices and the quality of the food are reasonable
13086,3,Great food and staff but the crowd is a bit sketchy
7228,3,Restaurant is clean and nice Staff is friendly Food is McDonalds food Good fast food
13128,3,Decently quick service but its just mcdonalds Prepare for the transients standing outside begging The staff kinda look they wish they were there and it kinda reflects on the service They have the kiosks to order from which makes service better
13125,3,As always just ok
24458,3,This McDonalds is across the street from the Orange County Convention Center The girl at the counter looked at us when we got there and made no attempt to greet us or even approach the counter until we asked her if she was Ok The food was fine but the service definitely needs improvement
13121,3,First of all  you will have a Santa Monica price here  That means its more expensive than other places for the same item in the menu Secondly  the restaurant was full of homeless people which disturbed peoples meal quite often with their shouting and cussing Thirdly  the restroom is freaking filthy
13116,3,The food was good The person working the counter did not seem to understand anything I said There are homeless people all around dont go there alone
24462,3,"Great food Not speaking English at the drivethrough window is a big downfall for me  Not sure why they would put somebody like that taking orders I repeated myself three different times and then they finally brought somebody else to the window Very frustrating
RJ"
27951,3,I felt so bad about how crazy busy they were that I wanted to jump behind the counter and help hand out bags They did the best they could considering how hectic it was and it was 11pm It was pretty cool to see the kiosk that you can order from Much rather order my food through that than a person
24463,3,The management staff were bullying a new employee by telling her have needed to clean the dirty trays  the manger did this while the girl was taking my order very uncool The rest of the staff in the drive through laughed at the the poor girl and I was embarrassed for her I mean I know its just a starting job for some people but they still need to be professional
13042,3,Nothing special Just McDuck like just McDuck
7255,3,Our order was right but we had to pull forward and wait and there was a general feeling of disorder
13107,3,I went on a Sunday and it was SUPER packed but the lines moved suprisingly fast FOODWISE one of the BEST Mcdonalds Ive ever been to CLEANLINESS one of the WORST Parking lot entrance smelled like Pee and the Patio tables were disgusting to the point I had to clean it myself and I STILL didnt want to touch it And the patio chairs were so Uncomfortable aswell
7261,3,Order was wrong
27944,3,Never in my life have I gotten an uncooked red middle burger from McDonalds until today Blaht YUK I nearly never ever eat  from McDonalds let alone a quarter pounder w cheese and the ONE tim
7263,3,Two for 5 Deal on quarter pounders with cheese But  345 for a large fry    Crazy 
7272,3,Good and fast service
7275,3,so have cit out all fast food from my dietbit on cheat daysbig Macs and fries are my go to meal
7283,3,Busy place  Long drive thru line  Food was okay
27926,3,Had a confrontation with the girl in charge of taking drive thru orders she took care of 3 cars in the left lane before taking care of us right lane then when I called her out on it she started yelling at me this was around 10am The manager took over and was very professional the order was taken correctly and nicely by the manager
27925,3,Food was fresh Person at the window needs to learn manners If a customer says thank you your suppose to say your welcome Its customer service
27948,3,Food was hot but service a little slow  Honestly though Ive paid 5 times more at Disney and waited for about 5 times as long  So putting it in relative perspective it wasnt that bad for this area  Were going again this morning Im not a fast food fan but hotel breakfast is just pastries so Ill update the review if my experience is different  If I were a local though Id avoid this whole touristtrap area on Irlo Bronson
27882,3,Not bad to be the only mcdonalds in the  area
7359,3,they take the fast out of fast food
7360,3,Undergoing renovations This is corporate location not franchisee
12999,3,I ordered tea with lemon But they didnt put any lemon in it When I asked where is my lemon the answer was we didnt have any lemon why u asking if I want it when you didnt have it
27840,3,Better to order in than go thru drive thru 
27834,3,No lie It was 65 degrees inside We ate at the car
7421,3,Decent McDonalds Clean and fast
7425,3,They need more workers here
7426,3,24 hours dine in  Thats what I like
7429,3,Got cold fries one day
7433,3,Its a McDonalds Exactly as you would expect
27814,3,Its McDonalds what can I say Food is good but what we all really judge from them is their service Always check your order 80 of the time they will always get big orders wrong Cant blame them when we expect our food fast
27841,3,Ordered through Uber Eats at around 11pm one day Ordered a Big Mac Meal A Quarter pounder and a 20 Piece They forgot the big mac and instead of a 20 piece i got a 10 piece Kinda upset at that but i
12985,3,What a unique McDonalds love the structure But the only reason that why its a low rating for me is because they sometimes get people order wrong Thats the only reason I have Also this place is sometimes very crowded and busy
15050,3,Love the frozen cold brew
7451,3,Its McDonalds lol what am I supposed to say
27800,3,No self service options you have to rely on the employees to givebring you everything necessary if they even bring it in the first place
12977,3,Busy but not speedybut accurate
7459,3,
12972,3,Slow drive through everything else is fine
27790,3,Went there for Doordash pick up Store was close So I parkedy car and walked to the drivethrough window A staff told me I have to get in line with all the drive through customers Which took me almost half an hour just to get to the window in my car Thats nuts The order has already been placed and all Im doing is just picking it up You guys gotta find a better system or else close this place down if you cant get it together
27788,3,Not sure I have ever been to one that deserves 5 stars  This was run of the meal McDonalds  Average in everyway
27787,3,This McDonalds is way more efficient than the other McDonalds down by  Animal Kingdom with the drive thru they are also a lot more friendlier at least on the intercom But they didnt cook my quarter pounder to temp because it was still red on the inside of the meat which was disgusting I had to go to the door in order to get my burger fixed which then I ran into the situation of them starting to close their doors 5 minutes before they were supposed to close at 12 and the employee looked at me and said we are closed when I literally was holding the burger in my hand to show for proof I look at the employee and say I know I came up here because I had just ordered from the drive thru this burger and it isnt cooked all the way She takes the burger doesnt say anything and shuts the door with me standing outside I then wait thank gosh she came back with a new one I didnt know if she was going to I didnt get an apology though for my burger not being cooked all the way through though
7442,3,Got my order wrong
7224,3,A good location Very crowded and the service is slow The WiFi is good Clean
7408,3,Big Macs not what they once were
7405,3,Dirty Service is really not there
24503,3,Service speed normal  Was asked to pull to a space and wait for our order when it came items were still missing so had to go inside anyway
7363,3,Costs about 80 cents more than other McDonalds
13032,3,Im only there for the Frauppes and the Cappuccinos
24505,3,Great location and I love the hightech features but theres a young woman there who is the rudest little thing Her name is GERLINE and shes a nasty unprofessional piece of work who needs to learn how to be courteous when speaking to customers and not be rude and treat them like they are an inconvenience Nasty little piece of work she is Other than that all good
7371,3,Good Food is always consistent
7377,3,A decent McDonalds A little outdated but open 24 hours which is a plus
13023,3,Its on the pier Its just in a place where activity happens Otherwise good
27864,3,Wish they learned how to cook there chicken sandwich  Love getting there chicken sandwich in the morning  but was very burned and didnt taste good at all even burned the 2nd one when I asked them to remake it
27863,3,Always forget my sauces when I get delivery
27845,3,Strange management Got what I ordered  but had to do at kiosk   No one at the register taking orders   My diet coke barely had any ice  When I asked for ice I got deer in the headlights look  Food was as expected  but very strange experience   I would not go back
13019,3,very good service and nice staff but the down side its full of homeless
7385,3,Good people  good service
7386,3,No longer open to walk ins 24hrs
7388,3,Eh Good When Youre On The Road
7389,3,Clean But soda machine out of order
7390,3,Never get your order right
13011,3,"Staff is so kind
Homeless people sometime come in this store
Then polis comeslol"
27854,3,Soooo slow Waited on line so long to find out there were only 2 people working Literally Im sure they make more than enough money to hire more people
27853,3,Average mickyD food not bad Customer service was not stellar and left much to be desired Local clientele made it not optimal for kids unless you are armed
7404,3,Its okay could be better
7384,3,Its McDonals Its what it is Good staff though
7218,3,The chicken patty taste old not fresh But over all good place to eat
27972,3,McDonalds is ok I just wish they wouldnt pester people in leaving while the kids are playing in the play place I mean I get the no loitering but we bought food and kids are just trying to play and they didnt really finish their own good They just wanted to enjoy the empty play area
7211,3,Three separate times weve been there they screwed up the order  Forgot something every time  Losers
28057,3,Not enough staff to take orders While I had a very basic order it was wrong Didnt make a big deal just left Very clean restaurant however Also needs to have more English speaking associates
7011,3,The food and service was good but kind of disappointed as this is the 1st McDonalds Ive been to in the south Bay that has completely closed off the bathrooms and customer areas  Im sure its due to pandemic but strange other McDonalds at least have restrooms open for guests
7012,3,They just be throwing my daughter Happy meal meal in the box Im not sure if its me or if its the people thats working at McDonalds but yeah my daughter is tired of her Happy meal just been thrown in a box its not a Happy meal its a throne in a box meal kind of sort of and if you want fresh fries and fresh nuggets you have to ask and its been several times where Ive ordered something and somethings missing so I have to make sure you looking your things before you drive completely off from this
7013,3,This McD has the best prices along Lawrence Expressway Drivethru can take up to 20 minutes during peak times I couldnt get a breakfast deal in the app to complete in time due to the long drivethru wait The app wouldnt allow curbside or instore pickup 10 minutes before breakfast deadline
7014,3,The food came quickly and it was hot my sausage bisquick was really good but the big breakfast came without condimentsWe asked for salt they said it was in the bag but the only thing in the bag was syrup and we didnt order pancakes
7015,3,Alright I am a little apprehensive in saying this but lately I have eaten at this McDonalds and one other place near my home and 3 meal I order has been tasting noticeably GOOD I never say to my kids wow you have taste this here taste it cmon take 1 bite and tell me this is good With that I would like to get some confirmations from others if food has improves in taste or just me I see myself with a big belly if food taste andor quality is on the up tick
7020,3,When I walked in some dude was walking out with a mean mug Dont know what happened though The wait was kind of long but the food was good
13258,3,Its McDonalds the only thing that is unique is the close proximity to the Santa Monica Pier Beware of the homeless who pester you as you walk into the restaurant  Some will even come inside to bother you
7023,3,Slow moving and long lines I wish they had more staff
24364,3,It was crowded I ordered fres and nuggets Fr
28054,3,The Asian looking manager killed my vibe I was asking questions about their cafe drinks in a bubbly tone and he just replied in a really monotone voice I was trying to make conversation and he just ignored me now I feel awkward as hell
7038,3,"This McDonalds is hit or miss depending on the staff Its quick most of the time due to the dual drive through order stations but that can also work against them and can slow down you getting your food at times to if you get out of order
They seem to have  great breakfast team but the dinner team is hit or miss One day its great and the next time your order is all jacked up They are normally pretty good with the normal menu items  its the specialty stuff they jack up like a Big Mac is Good here but a Grand Mac wont be because they leave off half the sauce or something silly 5 lbs of lettuce you get what I mean Inside tends to be better then drivethrough if you have the time"
7039,3,Food tastes like any other Mc Donalds There was a short wait They were out of Diet Coke in both soda fountains They were also low on ice for the drinks The dining area needed to be cleaned of all the trash by the soda fountains tables and floors  They were also out of ketchup in the ketchup area by the soda fountains
24378,3,Took forever to get our food every day we were there this week when they got very busy One night we were there for almost an hour waiting in a crowd I feel like they might have been understaffed because they werent working quickly Everything was good and correct but they ran out of one items I ordered so they replaced it with a different flavor
13246,3,place was kind of crowded and the waitress who took the order at the cash register was more concerned about her phone then just getting me two chicken sandwiches Im not one to nitpick but I havent had a job in 4 years and people like that actually get hired I just dont know where has my country gone LOL
13245,3,Just a another McDs They have 4 do it yourself ordering kiosks where you can order and pay They are usually fast I waited 4 mins for my order
7044,3,This McDonalds gets a 3 rating due to their lack of attention to drive thru orders  Numerous times we get home after a visit to McDonalds and notice the forgot to include apple slices or apple juice  I agree these are smaller items and do not effect the price much however when you have kids waiting for their orders get very upset and get angry n hurt that these things are missing  It is very upsetting  Also we tend to order a lot of unsweetened ice teas  8 out of 10 times the tea tastes disgusting  It is old tea or the bag doesnt get changed when the make more  I get so mad that no one seems to care enough to be sure every shift cares to do their job correctly to ensure a high quality in ALL their products  I have brought these concerns to numerous managers and employees but never get satisfaction that they care and fix the issue  It may be ok for a week but happens again or on a different shift  All emplyees should care enough about their jobs and themselves to do the best they can in all areas of a job performance  Please do your best to inform this McDonalds of these issues and have them retrain and fix these issues  My sanity and their job performances depend on this  Thank You
7050,3,Its a hit or miss McDonalds sometimes they have the best customer service and the fries are amazing Sometimes the guy
7053,3,service was okay during drive thru GET OFF THE PHONE AND PAY ATTENTION WHEN YOUR IN DRIVE THRU DONT GOT TIME FOR YOU TO REALIZE THE CAR INFORNT OF YOU IS GONE I Do not like their drive thru parking either They shouldve moved it somewhere else I went during lunch and they parked every single car and then had only one employee walking out the food Hmm bad system
24385,3,I came here on my way to a meeting in the convention center I had 20 minutes to be where I needed to be so I figured I would swing by this McDonalds and grab some food Boy was that a mistake I arrived at this McDonalds at 1145 I did not order my food at the drivethru window until 10 minutes after 1200 By the time I actually got my food it was closer to 1230 This has to be the absolute slowest McDonalds in the history of any restaurant in the world It has double drive throughs and they seem to prefer the inside Lane to the outside lane They were taking the orders of customers on the inside line too if not three to one Not exactly sure what was going on inside the building But they were slower than molasses I understand that there is issues right now with finding employees for a little bit of prep work would have sped up the process a little bit Thats why I gave them three stars instead of one
7026,3,Actually the great suck we didnt have milkshakes and we got shorted a burrito and their night shift is quite rude will not eat there again
7059,3,Place is usually not busy but service can be slow they seem to be understaffed  Staff The place has really odd seating layout inside but they have seating outside in the shade  Drive through is usually empty also  They have assigned mobile order parking
7006,3,This is a typical McDonalds I ordered a frape and had to wait 10 minutes for it to be prepared Not impressed
7001,3,Friendly service but sometimes they have young people taking orders that have no manners Overall quick and fast for lunch hour
6948,3,Mickey Ds is always mickey ds Lol
13307,3,Service is great but the restaurant has a smell of homeless all over
13300,3,Very nice very quiet very efficient not chaotic the way it used to be a very big Improvement go visit
24347,3,This mc Donalds is self order only And the self order board wasnt working properly So it made for a lengthy wait They dont have any cash sale lines It seems they only want drive through business  As far as the foodwell you know what your gonna get here
13297,3,Like the new look and their own parking garage Didnt like the automated machines taking over the the actual staff
13292,3,Duh duh duh duh duhhhhh Im lovin it It
24349,3,The food was alright but the arcade area was a total letdown for my 5 and 6 year old We only spent 10 but essentially none of the games worked and they didnt get any tickets when they should have To small children this is a big letdown The young man at that counter was kind and apologized and I get it
6973,3,This McDonalds is open late has two lines to order food through drive through However the speaker on the one I went to is a little low and they got my order wrong Luckily the staff member read back my order before I paid and I was able to correct it before I paid Food was barely warm but well packed
6978,3,Late night service is mixed they reset their registers at arbitrary times and they either are cash only or close the drive thru completely during this time There seems to be no schedule just depends on when they think itll be slow it seems Those inconsistencies aside the food and service is typical McDonalds
7005,3,Even after confirming my order when paying I received the wrong sandwich I went through the drivethru so I didnt realize there wit until I got home I had received a chicken deluxe sandwich instead of a quarter pounder deluxe Fortunately it was tasty and well made but still disappointing
6984,3,Items were frequently missed out but  I get it these people are slammed with orders so you cant expect the orders to be 100 accurate everytime But today my little one got so mad when she found out her drink and apple slices from her HappyMeal were missing I mean come on you order a Happy meal and only get a burger with nothing to drink Well at least you managed to put a toy in so thank you for that Not great AND we were the only ones in line at that time so they were not that busy I guess
24352,3,Its fast food so its hit or miss Often the fry grease tastes old The Tea fluctuations in sweetness can throw you for a loop going anywhere from bitter to syrup Half the time late shifts miss part of your order and if they are busy sometimes the food especially fish and chicken wraps do not appear to be fully cooked Other times its great
24353,3,As so often is the case my big Mac wasnt hot  fresh  hubbys coffee was cold  but they did replace that no friendliness of staff  just functional
6990,3,Food hasnt changed but the ordering app makes these necessary visits less painful You still have to deal with those in front of yo
6991,3,"The food was great with the exception of the fries They were stale and I would have gone back around and had them replaced but the guy at the drivethru window was annoyingly slow and the rest of the food would have been borked The hamburger made up for it though did you see the greasy heart attack waiting to happen

Just an FYI mobile ordering saved absolutely zero time at this location We still had to go to the drivethru and wait and they didnt have anything ready so unless you just like ordering from an app dont bother

I would still recommend eating here YMMV on the staff at any fast food restaurant Sure this guy was somewhat annoying by being slow but he wasnt intentionally being a jerk or anything"
24354,3,they rarely get my order right  I know my order is taken correctly because the woman who does drive thru she has a long braid and she is amazing
13279,3,Its ok for a beach side McDonalds A bit of a homeless presence but not as bad as you would see in downtown LA
13278,3,Friendly staff but the place gets shady after 11 pm Though its open till 3AM i would not recommend going for late night cravings
6997,3,No hot mocha in the morning Why is coffee with chocolate milk so difficult Simple fast food Mickey Ds Cmon now
13272,3,The coffee is good It is clean and warm and safe Afterwards I always regret eating there
28062,3,Tepid food after waiting 15 min is not cool  Florida McDonalds needs to step up its focus on food preparation  When their fries are hot and fresh you cant get enough  But cold  enough said
6942,3,Took a long time to get food
13233,3,Pretty sketchy the only McDonalds Ive ever been to that had 2 armed guards at the entrance food was as expected tho the new menu was hard to figure out too high tech
28047,3,Totally hit or miss Old town is near by  So Friday nights and weekends are busy at night However decent staff and consistent with the chains food quality
13178,3,Very good service they try to keep it clean only alot of homeless ppl We get something quick to go always full of ppl too
7156,3,Night staff is usually the best making fresher food  Even if waits exceed normal afternoon staff needs help 
13174,3,Before heading to Santa Monica pier we made a lunch break here so we can grab a quick bite to eat before heading to the beach Location was great and the service was fast and accurate
13173,3,Just another McDonalds restaurant for a quick meal The quality is the same than in any other McDonalds restaurant So nothing better than in others From my point of view the services were not as clean as I have expected That is the only bad point
24427,3,When we went it was cash only They were out of ice cream and frappes Our food was decent They were extremely slow
28002,3,Slow Food often old
7176,3,Staff we not communicating with eachother I think their register was down and they missed a couple of our items and they both seemed really stressed and annoyed
7180,3,Food comes out quick and the food came out warm too much traffic in the drive thru however
24438,3,"I was here a couple times during a week I would say it has been pleasant service as expected But man Saturday was not normal Trash bins over flowing tables dirty self help machines missing table locator and drink dispenser area was messy From what I could see the back looked cleaned but the front of the house was a wreck

Back to the self help machines it states that they will bring you the drink to your table They brought me the food but told me to get the cup up front I dont really care but someone should change what the machine states

Overall this is a modern looking McDonalds Most of the days I went here it has been good But I guess their weekend was a different story"
13179,3,Usually crowded soda fountain is not very fizzy and employees are quite distracted Other than that a good place to get a quick bite on your way tofrom the beach
13156,3,Bit sketch here late night
24441,3,Well just because that McDonalds is on international drive which is in the tourist area doesnt give him the right to jack up their prices and I go up and down international drive quite a bit I drive charter buses and because their prices are jacked up so high I wont bring a busload of people there now the young lady that brought my lunch out you know she was very very friendly very nice young lady the restaurant is clean but your prices are way too high and until they come down I will not bring 50 60 people in my bus to that location just because youre on international drive dont mean you can rip people off and thats all youre doing when I can take them four miles down the road to a Burger King and their prices are a lot lot lower so if you want to start seeing more charter buses come in there with people lower your prices
27985,3,This location is frequently busy and if the general manager isnt on site the dining room and play area become dirty quickly  Service is notoriously slow and since they cater to primarily a transient crowd there really isnt a need to improve
7188,3,Unfortunately there are not many salad selections if youre trying to eat healthier
7197,3,Take too long to wait 12 minutes for curb side orders
27980,3,It was ok lil wait because busy but not too bad and food was okalso
24447,3,If I was rating this on speed of service it would be negative stars but the food was good once we got it This location is extremely busy and feels under staffed for the amount of business they get What is the point of all the kiosks and a double lane drive through if it overwhelms the staff and you wait for 3040 minutes for a 10pc mcnugget meal
7200,3,Have a drive through though its typically faster to just go inside Car lines can be a bit slow
7202,3,Had to wait 10 minutes on the side waiting for a Quarter Pounder all the while the other bag was getting coldnot happy
13136,3,Every time I go to this McDonalds everyone is so friendly and make me feel welcome EXCEPT the cashier named EDNA She gave me the WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER She was disrespectful and rude How does McDonalds let her work here
13155,3,My order was not completed because I asked for grape jelly and 2 employees gave me strawberry and said grape didnt exist at that store When I told the head manager I was allergic to strawberries she apologized to me and said they have plenty of grape jelly and gave me 2 I also had no napkins in the bag so I had to come back
7063,3,Not the best quality fast food but it
28006,3,Good for a quick bite on the go with a busy day right across the street from Old Town this place is got an indoor playground which is nice The kids enjoyed it the one time we came in and stopped and let them play Unfortunately the last time we came through the drivethru and there was a vagrant near the one entrance so that was a little unsettling other than that has McDonalds go it was okay
28023,3,Absolutely the worst service I have ever had at a Mcds The place was busy and lacked the peoplesystem to handle it Customers angry having to wait so long for food while others had to return theirs because of inaccurate orders It took me 20 minutes to get a simple order  one chicken wrap with sweet tea
7077,3,Versus others in the area this place always has trash bins full and rarely tiloilet paper No changing tables in mens room Dirty bathroom Food consistant with others Very busy but still could be clean
28042,3,Have to place your own order They forgot some of our food Bathrooms smelled Play area still closed
28040,3,They did not get my order right at the drivethru so I had to go back and was late for work
7085,3,"I am not sure if anyone in the USA would read reviews about McDonalds but here it is anyways

They are mediocre even by fast food standard Unless you are really hungry or thirsty always try to avoid it"
13218,3,It was crowded and it was a little confusing to find the line but the food came fast and was consistent with other locations  We ate in a covered outside location that was really nice
7087,3,Typical McDs but did look a bit more modernized  The lady taking orders was nice Plenty of parking and drive thru line was organized Good amt of mobile order parking as well
28039,3,Very close to Disney  Clean and quick service
13214,3,They really try hard to keep it clean and friendly but due to so many homeless people inside and out of the store its impossible to enjoy coming to this location without be harassed by them  Theres free parking on site
13213,3,It was interesting Ive never had to pay for parking in my life or for the bathroom but it was nice to eat some McDonalds at the high price that it was
13188,3,Always have the homeless there taking the spots its Santa Monica Cant blame them for hanging out but all the good tables are taken by them Otherwise just your everyday McDonald food 
7099,3,They say they are open 247 but they are closed everyday between 3am430am
13207,3,The McDonalds was busy but very efficient Cant say I was impressed with the 2 napkins provides for 3 peoples food and how they didnt add the ketchup requested
28035,3,3 stars for being a clean and friendly McDonalds but itll never be a 5 star stop because they NEVER have ice cream Doesnt matter where you go theres a 90 chance they are out or the machine is down Morning Down Afternoon Down Nighttime Down Halloween Down On Halloween Yes completely down all night I know that ice cream machines being down is a running joke but this location is the king of it
13200,3,"Out of the places I have visited here sadly this one offered at least the most friendly of the people I encountered

However it is more expensive then the basic McDonalds youre use to It is one of the cheapest around considering your other options"
7116,3,app glitches out and they made pay extra for what I order through the app because the deal didnt apply anymore
7117,3,Not the best McDonalds Service was fairly slow for not being too busy and my order was given to go e
13197,3,Very slow
24412,3,The team had no personality and had even had one employee on his cell phone while making orders  The food I got had the fries lukewarm yet the burgers were fine  They were more concerned with talking with themselves and not the customer  Outside of that the place was clean and recieved my order in a quickly manner
13194,3,Long lines and short staffed it seemed  They can be good other then that  Tried the bacon cheese fries and I instantly wished they was not only for a limited time only
7121,3,Like always very pleasing but the area outdoor can use some tidying Staff great
7101,3,"Standard McDonalds
But what was going on with the restrooms Only two available and one is permanently closed The other one is a favorite place for the homeless people in ten area as it seems Two of them spend there 30 mins No chance to get in"
24053,3,Clean and cashier was polite
12218,3,Poor service and constantly messing orders up
24966,3,At least they finally renovated so it doesnt feel like the 60s still
26261,3,Usually really good but this time I was missing the deluxe on my chicken deluxe burger I ordered
11302,3,Service was subpar today Food was bland and warm at best Cashiers treated us like we were an inconvenience Reminds us why we dont go to this location even though its easier to drive to
26249,3,You can check your box when you pass  for drive thru Half of your order you will find
11296,3,Not a safe McDonalds to enjoy your meals The interior of the restaurant is a hang out for the homeless  They use restrooms to use drugs and theyre rude to customers  The staff are told daily about this problem and nothing is done The staff are helpful and friendly and make deliscous food items
9817,3,Messy MC Donalds Staff is grumpy And the tables were very dirty the food is fine
9820,3,Not the best McDonalds in the world not even in Washington But its fast and cheap
11290,3,Very clean place  polite employees BUT they did not get our order right It was morning approx 800 am Not many people in the restaurant at the time we ordered We asked for ed gi white elites with real bacon Our orders were regular egg mcmuffins with Canadian bacon
26242,3,Unorganized and slow but atleast they got the order right
11288,3,Its clean But you have to get a token to use the bathroom p
26238,3,Customer service needs to improve Especially The drivethrough area
26236,3,Food was good but the mens restroom was being cleaned for a long time and multiple men walked away or used the womens restroom
9826,3,The service and the food were good The place itself was not quiet
9832,3,The place looks like another fast food
25563,3,Interesting McDonalds like the animal theme nice place to bring the kids
9843,3,They are very good
11274,3,Ordered online and waited 5 mins to pick up the food Waited around 10 more mins once I got there and had to politely deal with the wasted day drinkers that I was trying to avoid by ordering online Food was what youd expect from McDonalds All in all 3 stars was definitely rounding up On a positive note I would say that the inside was much nicer than what I remember them looking like when I was a youngster Big props for the solar panels in the parking lot
25565,3,Over priced for the quality of food and the customer service is poor  Hire a diverse quality trained staff and the company should get better Customer Service
11272,3,I waited in line for an extremely long time There is no way to exit the drive thru while in line especially if there is an emergency Customer service was terrible no greeting when I pulled to the speaker box and when I paid with quarters its annoying I know but its still money and not pennies the cashier grumbled about it
11267,3,I visit this Restaurant quite often and the staff is pretty nice and they always give me an excellent service but I cant say the same about the manager Valentina she is very rude with the staff  pretty disrespectful when she talks to them and she dont care to do that in front of the customers and she was not nice with me and with the other two customers who were there  She rolled her eyes while she was taking th
26267,3,What a unique McDonalds love the structure But the only reason that why its a low rating for me is because they sometimes get people order wrong Thats the only reason I have Also this place is sometimes very crowded and busy
11311,3,I have been here several times after 1am  3am and there are no employees anywhere Doors and drive thru shutdown 24 hours on some days but not every day Take your chanceRoll the dice It is good exercise walking there and back
11316,3,Food was good Service staff was clueless Watched 3 orders get served ahead of me all 3 were wrong in some way All 3 had to ask for drink Many minutes of clueless staring at order screens trying to figure it out They gave me an extra sandwich i didnt order
26281,3,I ordered tea with lemon But they didnt put any lemon in it When I asked where is my lemon the answer was we didnt have any lemon why u asking if I want it when you didnt have it
26329,3,Long lines rude staff you ask for sauce but never get it They only have one register open Homeless at front entrance smoking blunts and can smell it while you are ordering
9744,3,Very clean
26324,3,Nothing special Just McDuck like just McDuck
9747,3,Its McDonalds what more can i say
9749,3,it is ok
11345,3,Back in the day Mickey Ds commanded the overall burger experience But these days their menu is bland Number 3 on my list
9751,3,Meh
11343,3,They accept EBT in the drive thru which is great Although they got my order wrong and the drink wrong but quickly fixed it with no fuss Its about what you expect from any ol Mickey Ds
26314,3,Im only there for the Frauppes and the Cappuccinos
26207,3,I Made the order by the Kiosko and i take 30 min to pick it up no enouhg cookiers and servers

11322,3,It took placing my order three times before the staff understood what I wanted  The food still came out wrong  The tea was sour and the staff couldnt understand what that means
11321,3,Gabby one of the supervisors she is very very rude she was working  the early morning shift she is ride over the speaker and ruder in person She doesnt be quite and let you talk and just keeps going and going not a people person Ive told everyone i know not to go to McDonalds on Garnet in pacific beach cuz this lady is nasty
11319,3,"You need a coin to access the restroom if you come late at night on the weekend you take your chances running into drunk frat boys or girls tourists who dont know how to wait their turn and homeless folks
The entire crew was Spanish speaking not a problem for me but apparently the frat boys were having none of it they were rude and ignorant"
26305,3,Its on the pier Its just in a place where activity happens Otherwise good

9622,3,Too much sauce on my sandwich
26455,3,Just another McDonalds restaurant for a quick meal The quality is the same than in any other McDonalds restaurant So nothing better than in others From my point of view the services were not as clean as I have expected That is the only bad point
26456,3,Before heading to Santa Monica pier we made a lunch break here so we can grab a quick bite to eat before heading to the beach Location was great and the service was fast and accurate
11491,3,Depends on whos working on whether you get good service or not
9576,3,My daughter got locked in the bathroom 
9533,3,Took a while I give me my food The fries were overcooked
26487,3,The McDonalds was busy but very efficient Cant say I was impressed with the 2 napkins provides for 3 peoples food and how they didnt add the ketchup requested
25472,3,This McDonalds is by the Dallas zoo  Kids were hungry after the Christmas lights at night event at the zoo   Went there and found it alright Service was relative quick but the store itself was quite dirty Play place looked like it hasnt been wiped and most likely havent been sanitized Bathrooms needed fixing and also dirty  Hope management can quickly fix since parents want to come by for its convenient location next to the zoo
9536,3,It does not allow pets 
9539,3,The place is quite run down The food is the standard McDonalds fare
26481,3,"Out of the places I have visited here sadly this one offered at least the most friendly of the people I encountered

However it is more expensive then the basic McDonalds youre use to It is one of the cheapest around considering your other options"
26476,3,Long lines and short staffed it seemed  They can be good other then that  Tried the bacon cheese fries and I instantly wished they was not only for a limited time only
11511,3,The restaurant location is convenient but very pricey than other restaurants in the area
11510,3,Ok need new items for parents that are there for there for their children  I dont want chicken nuggets 
11451,3,It was alright ice cream machine down as usual
11509,3,Slowprocess of any order ever not much staff also sllow moving as well
9560,3,Its McDonalds You know what youre getting  And the ice cream machine is always broken
9561,3,You will be welcomed by friendly drug addicted homeless people
9564,3,Fast food Boo But kids gotta get chicken nuggets
11500,3,Nicely remodeled Doors still open after Midnight on a Saturday night
26470,3,Always have the homeless there taking the spots its Santa Monica Cant blame them for hanging out but all the good tables are taken by them Otherwise just your everyday McDonald food 
9566,3,Good fast food I dined alfresco
26461,3,Usually crowded soda fountain is not very fizzy and employees are quite distracted Other than that a good place to get a quick bite on your way tofrom the beach
26460,3,Very good service they try to keep it clean only alot of homeless ppl We get something quick to go always full of ppl too
9575,3,its good and i really like the vanila shake here
25483,3,We really like this Mc Donalds Its special because of its jungle theme  But lately the staff has been on the rude side
9628,3,Not restroom available
11449,3,I dont think they cooked my quarter pounder while I waited I watched them pull the meat out of a warming oven Not what they advertised
25498,3,We were ordering what it was on the manu a d they said they didnt have anything That the breakfast  was over but all they had was the breakfast menu Lol they forgot to change the menu on screen
25524,3,Quick service especially if you have the app Drive thru line was crazy long but i always pick up No lines no long wait good job staff
11399,3,Place seems dangerous  Dining room closed  Lady at counter was very nice though and the food was well prepared
9686,3,Good food
26367,3,Great food and staff but the crowd is a bit sketchy
26366,3,It is an OK place to go if you do not have a better option The prices and the quality of the food are reasonable
26357,3,Food was good jt was crowded there was gum in my chair didnt notice til i got up and it was all over my shorts
11386,3,Decent enough McDonalds  There can be a rough crowd at times  But thats PB for you  Not the cleanest either  But they have some special challenges in this area
11385,3,Pretty outdated as far as McDonalds are concerned and often has a not so family friendly types of customers inside Food however is consistent with all other locations
11384,3,Nothing fancy it was my first time in that area when i stopped there to get some coffee Their bathroom has a coin operated lock which gave me an impression that its a bad neighborhood
9679,3,Fast food
9702,3,Okay for the most part
9704,3,Its McDonalds what more can i say
9705,3,Great service
26356,3,This McDonald tourist city attraction restaurant is over rated by its local customers  During my visit to this restaurant none of its employees had people skills or customer dissatisfaction resolution skills  Its employees escalated its customers verbal complaints to verbal challenging arguments  Without any complaint resolution
26355,3,This is a very convenient location Probably the most affordable food in this area near the pier Its usually very busy with foot traffic for the beach and the promenade You will encounter all types from international tourist to local bums Its fairly clean considering the large amount of customers The orders are quick but be sure to check it before leaving Not the most accurate employees
26348,3,Bathrooms are very dirty and lines are very poorly organized I was able to skip ahead of at least ten people that were ahead of me because they dont communicate the registers that are open to the customers The booths in the far side of the restaurant smell like cigarettes Food was served quickly and with good quality however
11372,3,The Pacific Beach McDonalds is okay if you dont mind extremely packed places mostly young drunksclubgoers but otherwise an okay McDonalds Expect long waits just because of the sheer amount of customers Then again almost anything beats the doldrums of the UCSD McDonalds
26346,3,I usually give high reviews but not this time The service is excellent Fast and professional staff all the way Truely representing McDonalds culture Unfortunately there is an issue with homeless people that brings this location down The restroom has a bad odor because of the homeless people washing up in there The restroom door doesnt close as to see whats going on in there such as drug use I can only speculate There are plenty of homeless people going in and out of the establishment to eat and use the restroom So they carry a bad odor It ruins the atmosphere Its depressing I witnessed a homeless man get hauled out by Santa Monica Police for lounging around not purchasing any food and being loud and unruly I applaud the quick response of the security officer on duty who immediately asked the man to leave several times always maintaining his composure even as the homeless man escalated Its a tough job but its getting done The priorities are kept here Customer satisfaction and safety are key to the staff and it shows
9720,3,Edible
25530,3,Put the animals back on the building
9703,3,Typical McDonalds experience
26334,3,The new renovation it went through makes it look more modern The ordering kiosks are perfect for the tourist that cant speak English or Spanish It is very spacious Please beware not to their fault the Homeless population can be a turn off to go their do to the fact that its a hang out spot for them I have no problem with that as long as they mind their own business and I do the same One thing that Im surprised about No refills on my coffee Really That was one of the main reasons I went there for breakfast Besides that its McDonalds we are taking about Quick and easy meal compare to other higher price options around
25522,3,This is a nice and efficient MDs  We use the app get any sandwich for 1  They let us do multiple transactions and we save a ton  Great location  clean and courteous
9669,3,Not open 24 hours
11447,3,What happened to the Big Mac Horrible patties were the size of a 50 cent piece
26417,3,Every time I go to this McDonalds everyone is so friendly and make me feel welcome EXCEPT the cashier named EDNA She gave me the WORST COSTUMER SERVICE EVER She was disrespectful and rude How does McDonalds let her work here
11445,3,"Its still Mickey Ds
Same food
Clean and quick service
I had to use a quarter to use the mens room"
9631,3,Okay need better security
9633,3,Not open 24 hours as advertised
11440,3,"Overall experience is decent and the tables are messy and too many homeless stay around there

9640,3,No good help
9677,3,So fast
11431,3,most of the staff is tired of waiting on the same  transient people that congregate in that areqSo you may hear some impolite bantering  between the staff  and customers  But everyone is chill that Ive come across 
9644,3,Clean and fast service
11427,3,Nearlly always messes up some part of the order and generally seem unhappy to work there
26408,3,Decently quick service but its just mcdonalds Prepare for the transients standing outside begging The staff kinda look they wish they were there and it kinda reflects on the service They have the kiosks to order from which makes service better
26406,3,As always just ok
26402,3,First of all  you will have a Santa Monica price here  That means its more expensive than other places for the same item in the menu Secondly  the restaurant was full of homeless people which disturbed peoples meal quite often with their shouting and cussing Thirdly  the restroom is freaking filthy
26397,3,The food was good The person working the counter did not seem to understand anything I said There are homeless people all around dont go there alone
26389,3,I went on a Sunday and it was SUPER packed but the lines moved suprisingly fast FOODWISE one of the BEST Mcdonalds Ive ever been to CLEANLINESS one of the WORST Parking lot entrance smelled like Pee and the Patio tables were disgusting to the point I had to clean it myself and I STILL didnt want to touch it And the patio chairs were so Uncomfortable aswell

10976,3,Too busy
10479,3,Fast foodplain and simple Nothing any different  from other McDonalds restaurants you visit
10482,3,Service was good food with okay
10970,3,Good for late night snack since it opens late The restaurant is newly renovated and kept clean But beware there is homeless later in the night sleeping
25855,3,I followed the suggestion of the app and did curbside again however they took way too long to bring out my food The last time I used this feature in the app they brought my food much quicker in about 5 mins This time it took them almost 15 minutes that is a very long time for fast food
25852,3,Its normal like other McDs More or less clean But the chickens are not fresh as usual
10501,3,The food is what it is but the staff have poor attitudes and are very rude
10505,3,A little dirty couldnt find a clean table even there were few customers
10506,3,Bathroom a no trash too full tissue stuck to the toilet seat and hairs in and around the sink
25867,3,Ordered in drive thru with my condiments and once food is brought out No condiments now I have to park to go get them
25774,3,Parking lot is crowded and road construction nearby is making it worse  Good service
10601,3,Its quick in and out gets a little crowded at noon
25766,3,Jamie is excellent but the drive thru service is not professional
10681,3,The staff might not be very knowledgeable or know english very much but they do work fast The reason for 3 stars 
10690,3,The nuggets were kind of burnt and I tried to order a McFlurry and they told me no which is really lame
25733,3,Slow service
25731,3,Good Atmosphere and very creative with the zoo theme but itits in a horrible neighborhood The worst in Dallas
25728,3,Got my other right the first time and was fresh
10708,3,Very crowded very loudly but the personal very friendly and the taste as standard McDonald
10710,3,Half the menu was listed as out of stock on the kiosk I ordered a soft drink They didnt offer it to me when they called my name at the counter because all of the table tents were missing I reminded them of my drink and they handed me a cup of water One of my burgers was offset in the bun by almost half and the cheese locked it that way all jacked up I get the labor shortage and its a busy place I would certainly go back I just cant say I loved it That would be offensive to all the other places that are outstanding
10739,3,This was an experience while we were in line waiting for our order someone got stuck in the bathroom and it caused quite a bit of stir So that was eventful but the food was bussin Lol so take with that what you must
25705,3,Ok service cashiers sometimes are rude
10671,3,"the salsa sauce is so similar to mayonaise dont take it if you dont take mayonaise
also no veggie or beanburgers staff was friendly otherwise tho some really weird customers"
25704,3,Cool location but ppl out side beggin for money
10761,3,"The attention is not so good Smells kinda bad
The food is fastly made"
10778,3,Bad experience as order not brought to table and electronic ordering system only copes with up to table number 120 and refused to accept our table number 127 Why doesnt the United Kingdom McDonalds App work 8n the USA
25686,3,The food came out in okay amount of time for 3 am But they added a chicken sandwich to my tab and forgot the cheese i added
10779,3,Service was good but sadly the people that were there made the experience horrible A group of kids was giving the poor kind cleaning lady a hard time and some person went into the restroom and took a shower and left all their clothes in the stall
10785,3,USUALLY IS BUSY AND HAVE GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT TODAY I GO ON NIGHT SHIFT AND ONLY HAVE STAFF TALK ENGLISH FOR ASSIST ON ALL THE CUSTOMERS AND LOTS ARE SPANISH TOURIST AND THE CLEANING IS LOOK POOR TONIGHT AND I SAW A ROCK EATING NEXT TO THE WINDOW INSIDE NOW I CONSIDER EAT IN THE OTHER MCDONALDS LOCATION IN ALTON RD
10823,3,"This McDonalds is located in a great spot for tourist that are walking What I really like is that there are computers where one can order and pay for their food instead of waiting in line Also they bring the food to your table Keep in mind this place can get very crowded given the location
The dining area should be cleaned by staff regularly"
10820,3,Much better places to eat
10805,3,No value menus late Very looooong waits Homeless piss peoples everywhere Rude managers clueless grill workers I feel bad for the cashiers who try and smile but get screwed over nonstop
25690,3,I know its part of the Dallas zoo attraction but the past two times I took my two granddaughters it was packed inside and the play area was filthy the trash bins were flooded with trash tables were nasty and dirty to sit at luckily I take my disinfecting wipes to takeouts with me
10757,3,"Wait times are very long but the employees are usually very nice from whenever I do go here once a year or so

Youll wait a long time but at least the staff arent rude"
10418,3,Whether is 3am or 5 still takes over 15 mins to obtain a caffee request
25682,3,I wasnt in a hurry but the drive though was super fast 2 mins if that long
10666,3,Service is very slow noone speaks englishdining room is closed Bathrooms are closed Punch someone there its ok but fall asleep at table your going to jail Food is ok They remove dollar menue when its busy
25763,3,Slow drive through but good food overall a 35
10903,3,I ordered normal Nuggets not Chili nuggets

10612,3,OJ was watered down and tasteless It was barely orange
10615,3,good food but not clean
25754,3,This McDonalds has its shifts Some shifts better than others Morning shift is perfect
10619,3,Good coffe and breakfast
10621,3,Drive through only we love LA
10625,3,All these places are the same The good is the coffee
10667,3,Lets say this place has everything to be much better having such a good location However it ends up attracting and keeping a lot of less wanted clients harassing everyone constantly Order machines not giving order paper created a lot of uncomfortable situations Food was okay
10626,3,It took ten minutes or more to get an order of fries
10629,3,Not up to par with McDonalds mission statement
10632,3,Not the most cleanly exterior maybe need a security outside
10882,3,"Lincoln road and Washington Late dinner food was correctly prepared served hot
This place is always packed It took over 10 mins to  get food If you find this review helpful please like it so others will view it "
10633,3,Meh when your hungry it will do
10634,3,The app doesnt save you much money at all
10635,3,Fast service but too many homeless people panhandling
10641,3,"Kids favorite restaurant and parents not so favorite but most of the time everyone loves their efficiency
You must order on a kiosk which is easy enough until you get to the end where it tells you to grab a table tent and input the number  I didnt see anything resembling a tent but I had an idea of what it should look like The counter staff were so busy they talked around me to other customers I waited my turn and finally got to ask for a number for my dine in order the table tent  The counter guy looked at me like I was speakt me the order in less than 10 minutes about half the time I wasted on the first try
As I sat waiting for my order I watched 3 people in a row return their drinks because it was the wrong drink  Maybe a cascade effect you get one out of order and the next few also get the wrong drink  As for me I also got the wrong drink
I love you McDonalds my kids and grandkids love you But this location has a lot of work to do to meet McDonald"
10662,3,Probably the messiest Big Mac I
10867,3,This is not open 24hrs Its crowded most of the day time Service could be faster and more organized
10627,3,Average fast food joint clean restrooms
10415,3,Typical McDonalds nothing special
10413,3,Fast paced food is out quick its a fast food restaurant so dont expect much anyway

10108,3,Closes at 5 what can I say no atmosphere But food was hot and tasty like it should be
10111,3,First time inside this McDonalds and used the touch screen to order my meal The employees were so helpful with friendly smiles My order was quick and helpful The only negative was i ask for a mayo package and was told that this place do not carry it but will give me a side of mayo for 030 cents I guess 30 cents well spent
10125,3,Mocha frappe and hot chocolate a bit bland Blueberry muffin was good Service prompt employee nice

10156,3,Okay sanitary dont like the car too much videos nice clean
10158,3,Got myself a mid afternoon mcafe mcompanied by a couple mcdoubles The burgers went 1 for 2 with one being nice and warm with the other needing a microwave minute or two  My ice coffee was Ok Not much else left to say Even if the fooddrink isnt always 100 percent on point here Im still a supporter Staff is cool  and theyre trying to make it work
10107,3,We wait too long for our food the staff not friendly kind of rude and others macdonalds  Ive visit are the same
10162,3,Food was good customer service was great but I wish they would follow the procedures when preparing iced coffee I got mine with no ice and didn
10167,3,I normally dont rate fast food giants and this location is in a noisy part at the edge of DTLA so its a difficult location but theyve screwed up so bad in the easiest way possible I have to rate them The last two times Ive been here including tonight they gave me a diet Coke I know I need to diet and not drink so much sugar for my diabeters but I didnt ask for a Diet Coke The first instance they didnt bother to read back my order or verify at the window This time they verified my order but left out the medium fries which was no big deal but screwing up the Coke after 
26014,3,Pretty Clean dinning room and enough personal to serve you without make you wait too long Big parking  Bathroom can be more clean They have free WiFi
25617,3,Able to purchase breakfast and or lunch dinner at 3 am which is a great convience Wanted jack in the box but lots of cops and for three am options are great 
10180,3,I had a bad experience here  My son who is autistic had to use the restroom really bad  He bolted in the womens restroom when a lady came out  I was confronted by the security guard in an angry manner  He said I had to buy something before using the restroom and said my son couldnt use the womens bathroom I attempted to explain to him that my son is special needs and did not understand the symbols on the restroom door  He argued with me and wouldnt shut his mouth  Before I left I  bought a meal for each member of my family  While waiting for our meal he stared at me like if he wanted some trouble  I explained to him that its frustrating when people cant see the situation parents with special needs go through  I apologized to him for getting angry and made him aware of the treatment we get at some establishments  Hopefully he learned a little about how to understand and deal with certain situations
10215,3,Its McDonalds you get what you pay for this particular one is relatively quick and I have no complaints
25994,3,Ample parking  Orange juice very expensive  350 for small one  However big breakfast was good as expected  Clean new looking dining room  Customer service as usual

Dry lifeless and uninteresting How about some cole slaw or at least lettuce and mayo"
10094,3,"I have only ordered to go from this mcds
Drive through screens are normally in some state of vandalized disrepair
Service is average Food is average

It is Ina very visible corner Turn into the drive through is a bit tight You face the people exiting the pick up window as you drive in so be mindful of your surroundings"

There is always homeless people also hung aroun"
11133,3,Looking for a quick bite to eat Low on cash Come to McDs Just dont use the bathroom Oof
10062,3,This McDonalds gets crowded quickly so do not expect a pleasant experience The food is good and I had a gentleman at the counter who was polite and good at servicing the clientele Best thing to do is avoid this McDonalds at all costs unless its too hot to walk to another location
11149,3,The Artisian Chicken Grilled Sandwich was too salty and the tomato slice and lettuce completely overwet
10066,3,The cleaning in this place is HORRIBLE I walked around the entire restaurant and there was not ONE clean table to sit at
10075,3,They need to keep their machines for menu selection up and running all the timeThat enables social distancing to be practical instead of lining up to a cashier
10077,3,Located on the 7th floor of Macys This McDonalds is a mad house Very large crowd filled with children who want to steal your happy meal toy We went here out of convenience but it was nothing special Just a McDonalds oddly placed in Macys Gotta love the chicken mcnuggets though
10084,3,Not enough seating but fast service Hidden on the seventh floor or Macys Ask for the happy meal It isnt on the menu board
11139,3,This McDonalds has a drive thru only your walking so I would call this a Walk Thru Window

10088,3,"Fast service although the table service which was supposed to work didnt work at all
It is super easy to order on the big screens and thats a benefit"

10065,3,Standard yummy fast food Very quick service even though theres a lot of customers and its located in a Macys The only thing is when I went to redeem a discount I had from a different branch they stonewalled me and said they had a different one and cant accept mine Slightly disappointed
26490,3,Very slow
10244,3,Its ok Not the fastest no play area not the best neighborhood lots of loitering but drive through is open late and is generally quick and often accurate
25973,3,I guess its okay its McDonalds You know fast food is supposed to be fast right This McDonalds was not The fountain drinks are served by the workers so even getting refills is slow That said theyre really nice people and they seem to work hard
10347,3,You guys should hire a security the mcds on main and manchester have one just the fact that theres to many homeless making customers that want to dine in bothered other than that the customer service is awesome here

10274,3,"This McDonalds has 2 DriveThru Lanes that help to speed things up However theres always at least 1 or more homeless persons standing nearby ready to ask for money

The sausage burritos never really seem fresh The ends are hard This is my experience time and time again when coming to this McDonalds For the record Im usually ordering a sausage burrito about 6 a m so I would imagine that it would be fresher "
25625,3,Its okay for kids its close to the Dallas zoo and kids can eat at play area where they have all the jungle animals from the zoo they can play with and take pictures
10283,3,I didnt eat here i just stopped to use the restroom which I didnt want to but there was nowhere else to go so I had to go here anyways surprisingly the bathroom was very clean and the restaurant inside looked clean inside also now the outside is a differnt story alot of homeless and people asking for money in the parking lot and it smells like pee but what do you expect so close to downtown and the greyhound
25627,3,We waited a really long time  The order was accurate
10290,3,A smaller than average McDonalds  but it has all of the menu items of any McDonalds  There is a mini Playland for children under about 5 years old but I recommend mandatory adult supervision since there are some hard surfaces There is a drivethru There are about 20 parking spaces on the small corner lot Otherwise it is a McDonalds

26787,3,Very happy That old prejudice of food places regarding no substitutions is finally being put to rest and this particular McDonalds location is at the forefront of that movement They really do try to accommodate peoplefor instance who love pancakes and eggs but dont eat pork Hold the sausage but you like hashbrowns No problem Hooray Maybe Jack Nicholson will come in and order a turkey sandwich
9003,3,Really strange because of giant touch screen ordering stations Theres a guy that directs you to them The stations are slow to respond to touch and generally slow to use Just hire some darn cashiers
9007,3,Why do I eat here Love the security guard Imagine Biggie Smalls shouting Have you finished your meal sir You can leave now
8935,3,Its been remodeledit is nice and clean I just would like more if they offered one free refill on a large coffee

11961,3,McDonalds is not a place where I would normally eat however it was the only game in town Food was hot and delivered to the table so who am I to complain
8898,3,Store was clean and meat in appearance The new order kiosks are a hit and miss and can be confusing as many people did not know how to work them McDonalds should ditch the kiosk and go back to the face to face service they had for years Food was ok for McDonalds
12030,3,Waited 10 minutes for my order to be ready via drive thru They forgot to put a hamburger party on one of my custom order cheese burgers So essentially I had a cheese sandwich

11907,3,I stop at this McDonalds like once a week or two and usually service is fine food is fine and normally I wouldve put 4 stars but tonight I went there ten minutes before they closed and there was a few cars there service like it usually was but other fast food restaurants I check my food before I leave I didnt here cause I come here usually and everything is fine but when I got home to night I ordered two large meals and when I pulled out the large frys it was filled with enough to fill up a small it was filled 13 the size of a large not just one but both were and a lot of them tasted kinda stale like they were made a couple hours before I got them

26754,3,As far as a McDonalds chain restaurant would go I can say that this is a decent location its really a McDonalds so I dont know how much you could realistically expect out of a place like this you know a fast food chain but the food here is on par with any other McDonalds is there The drivethru is relatively quick which is good

9063,3,Its okay its not the best part of town a lot of homeless people and Drug dealers around I was just applying for a job if its the day Im thinking of it gets crowded a lot of Travelers its clean you have to get permission to get into the bathrooms that sucks
26769,3,Small and cramped inside always seems busy Parking lot is small too but drive through delivers standard menu mostly reliably Easy access to freeway at this location too
26781,3,Drivethru But just afterwards I found out the news that McDonalds is supporting terrorists Hamas and suddenly against Israel So I wont be going back to McDonalds until that changes
9026,3,Single meat pattie on both double quarter pounders that I orderedno time to go backpretty disappointing
11950,3,"Worst Buttermilk Chicken Sandwichchicken was like rubber
Fries were fair
Husband had 2 Cheeseburgers and they were not great either
Coffee and hot mocha were good
This McDonalds was beautiful inside Looked just renovated"
11944,3,The ordering system was fancy there We could take our time to decide what to order and did not have worry about staff waiting for your order The food price is too high given the quality
11943,3,Employees need to take more care in their sandwich assembly To be fair the employer should pay a more competitive wage to incentivize better work
25166,3,Neutral
9034,3,Only stopped for a friend but the fries were hot and fresh and very delicious We were hung over its still micky dees
9035,3,Its McDonalds not much else to it There are a lot of homeless that hang around this location though so Id recommend the drive through I was solicited for money inside the restaurant
26774,3,Hey what can I say But Sure make not just good  Damn good hot French Vanilla Latte with whipped cream on top I like it so much they recognize my voice coming thru the drive thru in Sherman Oaks The only thing I like better is when someone brings it home to me and we put just a timble full of Bristole Cream or Kalua or my favorite Pennsylvania Dutch Egg Nog in it Oooh weeeee Better watch that Penn Dutch Sure will creep up on you though
26768,3,Small McDonalds Clean The restrooms were locked and I had to find somebody to let me in That always frustrates me The place had about 50 of the staff needed to meet the crowd
9038,3,The food is always on point but you can never predict if the service will be fast or extremely slow especially in the drive through
11935,3,This could be a fluke but on 3 separate occasions when I have gone there over the past 2 months their soda machine was not working  So you couldnt order a meal deal  Other than that it is a nice regular McDonalds
25173,3,Neutral
9044,3,I was told by manager no free refills for coffee here and only decaf coffee for Senior Coffee price Been to McDonalds all over country Never been told this before
25174,3,Neutral
26773,3,This isnt IN n OUT and people do actually want to look at the menu so having your employees stand outside in the hot sun around the corner from the full menu taking orders with an out dated sandwich board is pretty ridiculous I ordered a 7 from the board which was a 6 in his tablet so my order was wrongWhy cant we simply order thru the box like normal drivethrus McDonalds
26772,3,Soso McDonalds but its the closest to the house They could do a much better job of cleaning it and also getting rid of the vagrants the sit for hours If youre looking for friendly service dont bother but its mcdonalds who come for the service They drive thru is fine but gets way backed up
11925,3,Okay i love McDonalds but yall fries have been cold for months
9050,3,Employees are rude and dont like to get your order 100 right Also doesnt like to read back the order
11921,3,Stopped here on our way home from Vermont  The restrooms were very clean but toilet paper was running low  Staff needs some training in customer service I felt like we were inconveniencing them for ordering  Manager who was at the counter and served our food to us was very nice though  Overall its a convenient pitstop on route 11 easy to access well lit and plenty of parking for cars trucks and RVs
9040,3,Good service  Tried the new fresh meat quarter pounder Cant tell any difference from old one
26856,3,I went to the store today and asked for a sausage McMuffin and they said they didn
8856,3,This is a mediocre McDonalds The line is always stopped and they have gotten my order wrong more than once If it wasn
8853,3,Hey its McDonalds what can you say LOL we already know were not paying for service theyve even lowered their standards and dont even care the manager there is this guy named Rodger he thinks hes super funny hes always making jokes when you roll up to the window problem is his jokes are rude he means well but half of the time he scares my kids But hey you want the cheapest cheeseburger on the block they got it
12182,3,Chicken not fresh  reheated dried out very friendly staff
24991,3,Good service Good food Reasonable amount
8673,3,Dont know why but painfully slow in the drive thru lately Also would be nice if they wouldnt smash the breakfast burritos with heavier items Little things let people know you care js
26914,3,This location has friendly staff but has one of the slowest drive thru in Los Angeles
8676,3,My sister and I went there 930ish after getting into town late for a funeral the next day We ordered off of their little automated order taking thing which we had never done before and got our orders and headed back to the hotel When we got back to the hotel I noticed that they had given me one of their 1 spicy chicken sandwichs instead of 1 cheeseburger I had ordered but as it was late and only over a dollar I didnt feel like going back to correct it But the rest of the order was correct and as far as the quality of the food I guess it was as decent as fast food from McDonalds can be
8682,3,"I ordered around midnight and it was fairly busy about 7 people in line for the drivethru I order all my fries with no salt for a few reasons 1 I was sick of always getting cold fries  2 They put way too much salt on these days
I needed to add something to my order at the end  and apologized thoroughly as i have worked fast food and understand the annoyance
The guy that helped me did not say one word in response about it which was rather rude
My change in order did not take any extra time  and by the time i got my fries guess what
They were cold"
8683,3,Staff was okay They messed up our order twice and then forgot about us when they had us pull forward at the drive through Other than that its a good McDonalds Its clean the food is the same as every other one and its got a pretty decent location
12175,3,This McDonalds will reaffirm your opinion of McDonalds
25000,3,It is McDonalds if you dont it know by now then I dont know what to tell you
8667,3,Forgot cheese on my egg McMuffin Everyone knows eggs are 1000000  better with cheese Not cool at all
26912,3,Most of the time it takes so long to get your order and so far it has only been this McDonalds
25005,3,They always get my order wrong
26911,3,Go to this McDonald  regularly  most of the time they forget something  straw napkin sauce  etc
8691,3,There was nobody at the register for about 5 minutes and one customer walked out The burger I got had Gouda cheese which tasted good but the bun was soggy and flat like it was on a warmer for some time They didnt have AARP specials but the manager offered a special anyway
8693,3,My neighborhood McDonalds and its meh lack luster service especially inside They gotta keep the drive through times down so the dining room service is at best a C The security people there are always pressuring people to leave Its assumed youre homeless or a bum so security gives you a time in which youve got to go Then theres the food I suggest a 5  10 minute walk to Apollo Burger
26901,3,Their prices are up snd transactions are down There are better fast food alternatives
12158,3,Its fast food Its not meant to be great but for what it is its fine
25010,3,Nothing special about any McDonaldsConvenience I guess
26900,3,Kinda Slow Service and a very small restaurant but the food here comes out decent
25016,3,Appears clean well run and consistent 
12169,3,Line too long to order and pay Only o e register open at noon time
12152,3,Your usual McDonalds food No better no worse Could use a remodeling Counter service slow I dont like waiting for fast food
24988,3,Food was pretty good
24987,3,We waited in the drive thru for approximately 15 minutes and received stale fries DISLIKE
12215,3,Fast friendly  Fries were cold
12214,3,"Coming home from Canada
Manager yelling at employees tables dirty Not a good day there"
8632,3,The food quality is good service is fast Location is downtown and clientele can be an interesting mix Staff is a bit hardened they get the job done but I think they have to put up with some unruly customers and it can affect there friendliness I receive consistently good quality food
26929,3,Great spot mellow atmosphere They really seem to have figured out their niche
12211,3,Did not receive full order Food was cold
26927,3,The staff was a little too casual when taking my order
8641,3,I come here quite often and for the most part its a normal McDonalds There is one manager here that frequently yells at his employees for no reason at all IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMERS I honestly feel bad that they have to be treated like that because apparently the manager doesnt understand that places get busy and there will be a wait a bit longer than usual This location always has homeless people standingsitting at each exit of the parking lot One hot summer day I was leaving this McDonalds and made the mistake of putting down my windows down before leaving the parking lot I was stopped by one homeless man and he asked for money and usually I dont carry cash but I happened to have a couple quarters in my car so I gave them to him and he thanked me for helping him and his brother out I pulled forward a bit more and his brother stood up walked over to my car and I thought he was just going to thank me for the money but nope He literally started climbing inside my car to get some food from the passenger seat He was grabbing me and had his hands on my steering wheel and I started driving away to get him to stop after offering him some more quarters so he could buy his own food and he kept yelling at me saying that he wanted the food I had In the end I left being robbed of the few bucks I had in coins in my car and feeling very much violated Again this could have been avoided by having my windows up but I thought it would be worth including that experience in my review Really not a bad place but definitely not the best
12205,3,Sometimes the fries are meh Thats all I get there 
12204,3,Average place to purchase fast food
8662,3,Just went in to use the bathroom while my friend bought a couple of little burgers Restroom itself did not seem dirty but I did feel compelled to construct a toilet seat cover from toilet tissue in the absence of actual seat covers available in a dispenser 
24977,3,Coffee was good and its a nice place to relax while waiting for a taxi
26923,3,Its McDonalds how good can it be Tastes the same as it did 50 years ago when I was a kid
12197,3,Fast service good food great workers
24985,3,Easiest quickest fast food place to grab a quick lunch with a friend between seminars
12195,3,They need more people on the weekends Very short staffed
12194,3,Ok for fast foodthe play area is extremely dirty nothing cleaned
12193,3,so so didnt liked it found it more expensive than Canadian ones
8657,3,McDonalds is a really popular place but i think there also very complacent why do they always put there fish fillet half way off the bun i like the taste of the fish but it would be nice if you added lettuce and tomato to the sandwich thats all
12191,3,Quick clean friendly and remade my fries
8660,3,"Great customer service
Food was old tasting and hard for some items"
8651,3,Ive been a few times and 50 of the time its been great with prompt service and order right but the other half of the time it was long wait and order wrong  Like I asked for hot n spicy with cheese and double cheeseburger and my burger had one patty and 2 pieces of cheese and the hot n spicy didnt have cheese and the chicken was really dried out and old So its a toss of the dice on how it is But they are 24 hour so I still go lol
9105,3,Lobby was closed but the drive thru was open I tried  to order on foot but they wouldnt take my order
8734,3,The reason why Im keeping this McDonalds three stars is because the customer service was great Although the food wasnt that great honestly Ive had better McDonalds McChicken was felt like it was just warmed up in the microwave the bread was stale and the fries were great because I like to order my fries with no salt and if youre looking for some fresh fries remember to order fries with no salt The parkinglot was clean The inside of the McDonalds cooking area looked really clean and spic and span the only reason why Im giving it three stars is because the food quality was not great at all so if you can improve that then you can either get another star or two more stars it depends on what you guys want for you to McDonalds
25017,3,Like most all other McDonalds nothing special
25053,3,It was ok
12096,3,Its McDonalds same anywhere you go pretty much
8830,3,Need to learn to give out ice in the drinks Visited twice both time barely any ice Male server at window gave me grief when I asked for some
12093,3,Go to a nice place and get a good burger for less Prices at McDonalds have gotten way to high for fast food
12092,3,Food is good but getting what you order the first time is a whole new challenge
8832,3,"This is a good location with easy access off 5th south  I like the new renovation which add 2 drive through lanes for faster service

Overall a solid typical McDonalds experience"
25061,3,Slow service
25066,3,yummy
12085,3,Greasy food but ok
12100,3,There is nothing special or exceptional about it it is just like any other McDonalds and I only went out of convenience and lack of options
12084,3,Every time I go to McDonalds I either get cold food or something is wrong like hey I want a Mcchicken add tomato and when I open it it has bun mayo lettuce tomato but no chicken like where did it go
8838,3,"Its a McDonalds what do you really expect The location is pretty sketchy as downtown SLC is full of homeless people many of whom use illegal drugs But it looks clean enough the fries are fresh and the employees at the drive thu dont seem to completely despise their jobs
Cheers "
8840,3,Dont really like the area a lot of people starring at you while trying to get food because there waiting for work because they cant work legally in this state so they chill out at this McDonalds and home depot department store to try and find work every single day and it makes it a little uncomfortable Cause they just stare at you anyone in the line at McDonalds
12076,3,Clean but took very long for fast food at least to actually receive the order
25078,3,Its McDonalds lol
26865,3,Good food But the area has so so many homeless people Be careful after dark
25081,3,Its a McDonalds
25084,3,Its McDonalds
25085,3,Its McDonalds
26860,3,I am giving this a low rating because it is at an intersection that is not easy to get in and out of The parking lot is tiny and you just cant work with it
25068,3,Its Mickey Ds
12147,3,Been there forever and it looks like it  Dont think they have renovated in 20 years
12101,3,They did pretty good for late night and a bus full of people Food was hot
25051,3,Its a McDonalds Same as all the others
8739,3,McDonalds has been around since the dark ages it seems and they have always been a pretty good place to enjoy fast food But lately the food hasnt improved any but the prices have skyrocketed and I refuse to go there anymore for what you pay for their meals you could dine out someplace with a lot more ambiance and social attractiveness
12143,3,Constantly messing up your order Makes you want to go somewhere else and eat
8741,3,If you want to meet angry homeless people who leave a giant mess at the counterheight seating area and then practically acost you for sitting at THEIR spot when they return from 20 minutes destroying the restroom to find that you as a customer have cleaned the wrappers off of the counter wiped it down and seated yourself for a meal you COULD think McDonalds Fortunately for this particular location the staff are all very nice and the food is as good as McDonalds gets Homeless people need to eat too forgive me for cleaning up and not thinking anyone was there It really was just a pile of trash I wasnt trying to ruin anyones day Oh well you cant win em all
25021,3,Hard to get a custom order correct
26890,3,Great food  Slow  bad drivethru setup  2 lanes into 1
8744,3,Food was typical They messed up on my drink but this is something that commonly occurs at most McDonalds The drivethru was very slow but that could be because they are short staffed
25026,3,The 
8750,3,The employees were friendly little stressed They had a manager who called in at the last minute The manager didnt cover their shift leaving the employees understaffed The employees did a good job being understaffed  having the am rush Coffee was great the wait to long This is I believe on 5th ave n We were leaveing SL to go to Tooele
8766,3,Its in a bad part of town A lot of homeless and panhandlers Bathroom are locked security watches you its an uncomfortable feeling Not really a good place to take the kids for dinning in But their service is okay and quick Their food is standard McDonalds service Nothing special about it And this McDonalds sometimes Jacks up their prices cause they say theyre downtown which to me means nothing but everything downtown costs more McDonalds should not cost more 
8826,3,Slow service and challenging communication
8773,3,I am not going to hold it too much against that them this particular store is in a part of town where there are a lot of homeless people Any other restaurant in the same area would have the same struggles Yes there are a lot of homeless people in the parking lot and in the store but there is nothing about this that is threatening to ones personal safetyI say this having gone here easily 100 times my doctor thanks me There is also an employee always in the parking lot or the store wearing a black shirt that says security in big white letters What this persons actual background is in security is less certainprobably the entire training consists of putting on the shirt The store is not as clean as one is used to with McDonalds franchises and the drivethrough service tends to be slower I assume this is because they have a hard time keeping good help Still at the end of the day I am impressed that the workers are generally courteous and the food is generally the same McDs consistency and quality even with the particular challenges of being in this part of the city
25040,3,Asked for hot coffee and it was cold
12121,3,Its been 3 years since I last had it but it was pretty good
12119,3,Restaurant isnt as clean as I would prefer but food is palatable
25046,3,Customer service is lacking
12114,3,Not a big menu Very surprised
12113,3,Next the 87N lost to Canadian boarder with friendly service Closest States McDonalds for Canadian boarder crossing shoppers
12112,3,Theres often stuff missing No soft drinks no breakfast Quick service tho
8810,3,Food is ok just to much McDonalds for me
8819,3,At this location you can only use the order kiosks not customer friendly The employees will not take your order at the counter Im assuming due to the shady area this McDonalds is in They didnt mess up my order at least
8774,3,Personally I think the service was slow The food was old and not very good quality The workers were nice and friendly but overall didnt seem to know what they were doing I honestly do not like this location
8631,3,When theres people working the service is pretty good today we went to the drive thru and no one was there to take our order
9107,3,Decent place to eat but Ive seen better McDonalds elsewhere in the city Needs to be updated
11862,3,Neutral
26583,3,I feel bad for them No help long lines take forever Tried them again I did not think it could get worse but
26581,3,The person taking my order Rushed me through my order I I need to do was let her know if I needed drinks or not She was so pushy we decided to get drinks somewhere else
9393,3,Clean fast service Did not have a full menu Strange Sign saying that paying customers can only stay at their table for 20 minutes Wonder what they would do if you stayed longer
25399,3,This McDonalds is right by my house and really the only reason I continue to go Service is excellent but Im missing something from my order every single time I go Having to go thru the hassle of getting out and going inside really defeats the purpose of going through the drive thru
9396,3,Finally last week coffee prices dropped to the advertisement rate of 1 I mentioned that it was advertisement for over a month before the reduction The oatmeal cookies have become chewy lately before they were hard as ginger snaps Ultimately theyre working on regaining local support Im a bus driver and that 1coffee helps me a lot
11648,3,Faat and easy going for today
11646,3,Could be cleaner but the staff was kind
9399,3,Great French fries but that as always depends mostly on when they last changed their fry oil The nuggets had been sitting in their hot tray for too long and were dried out and looked like the had also been over cooked good friendly staff though
9400,3,This place provides food like all other McDonalds does but is one of those that is untidy Garbage is not picked up even when its already full And the restrooms need tokens to open which makes this experience so unpleasant The food though is great but with all not so good traits mentioned above it wouldnt be a good experience especially for a family dining in
11642,3,To many street people dominating the bathrooms
9405,3,What can you say about Mickey Ds They have a decent variety on their menu  Now  they are making their quarter pounders fresh when ordered so you may have a slight wait  But Im sure it wont take that long  I ordered the fish sandwich which is just okay I wish theyd make it bigger and not skimp on the slice of cheese I like their 1 2 and 3 menu The fries were fresh but dont come close to wonderful fries served at the BK Lounge Take notice though king McDonalds is open 24 hours Id take their fries any day at 3AM vs No fries from the closed Burger King near my house
9406,3,Customer service wasnt great I wasnt welcomed and the worker didnt seem like she cared I was there I only got a 20 piece I got it in a minute They tasted a tad bit off than the usual nuggets so i didnt enjoy it as much The place was clean
9409,3,It is a weird experience The food is really good but the service is horrible The place is dirty The customer cant get a tray after a certain time The problem is all the tables are dirty which makes it even more frustrating
25404,3,The staff works super hard but the zoolocation deters from it shining Keep the great job up day staff The night staff needs to brush up
9411,3,Not your best McDonalds but the fries are hot and the ice cream machine works Tables are a little dirty during lunch so be prepared if your eating in to wipe before you consume
9412,3,It was okay staff was nice the food was not comparable to other McDonald chains French fries were freezing cold Inside needs to be redone and has a slight stench
26576,3,Neutral
26575,3,Neutral
9418,3,Customer service wasnt that great After I paid for my food and my food was given to me I was told they were out of pies So I had to wait for a manager to give me a refund which took a while
9381,3,Seen one seen them all There not a lot of places in the area that have large play areas so children tend to love this place If you want your kids to run free and havd fun this is as good as option as there is here They tend to have a lot of private events on weekends but the restaurant nonetheless remains open to the public
9380,3,Had trouble counting the number of fries I had ordered had to go back three times  Check your bag before you leave
11659,3,Not so nice crowd that gathers
9370,3,Great location in the heart of DC It is really close to DuPont Circle The staff was pleasant The food was above average for McDonalds standards Go in grab a bite in a small period of time I would go back if I am in the area
26640,3,Inconvenient parking lot horrible place to put a McDonalds  staff was not very friendly or helpful overall just a soso experience for the standard McDonalds food
25365,3,Just finished a remodel and took all the zoo animals away very disappointed in that however was clean and service was great
26633,3,It took to long to get to the order screen at the drive thru I dont get why it takes longer at night when its not as busy than in the day Its not just st this McDonalds but at all of them
9317,3,Average service and food long wait times at night and not in a great area
26629,3,Always a long line and always slower to get you your order I dont think Ive ever come here at any time of day and been able to work m
9324,3,Milkshake machine seems to be broken as much as it works Mediocre service and disorganized employees
11691,3,Hit or miss on the service
9329,3,The ice cream machine wasin factbroken
11684,3,Very slow service
26572,3,Neutral
9340,3,Dont go at night their unstaffed orders take forever
9342,3,It wasnt the fastest service but it was fine
25380,3,Its Only GOOD occasionally if I go in the morning their on point but lunch time is horrible they always forget part of my order or its made wrong or my fries are too hard now usually I dont complain but all they do is send lil free meal cards but someone needs to know and correct the mistakes they know they can do better
11674,3,Always there when need em
26606,3,They are going high tech Unfortunately their equipment is giving problems so it takes a long time to order Also there is very little parking
9354,3,Tried to use the self service kiosk and the coupon from the MD app on my phone the kiosk system went down and didnt process the order pushed the help button on kiosk waited for awhile until the cleaning lady offered to help me but couldnt fix the issue so she asked me to get in line and place the order at front at least 5 min passed before I got to the front and I explained the issue and situation with the kiosk then the lady at front say  sorry your coupon said it was already issued used I told her yes I used it at kiosk but the order was never processed there she had to call the manager and I have to explain again the issue to her so it took more than 15 minutes no place a simple order with a coupon from the app
9355,3,Mostly the down trodden community comes here but is less crowded and you get your food quicker
26598,3,"Went in for a quick breakfast with family but took longer than expected after ordering by self ordering screens Its tough to drink McDonalds coffee after having tasted other good brands but the food was acceptable
Few spaces for parking and limited space for dine in
This place seems popular for early birds going to Universal Studios it quite busy and thus the long wait"
9361,3,"Reasonable service and good hot food One Korean employee doesnt speak English so train him or keep him in back not at cash register  He ignore all and says dont have it to everyone

Need better management decisions  Need breakfast items available at 2pm as did before"
26592,3,Not much to it
26613,3,This McDonalds location welcomed you to experience the taste of the new world order The Cashless Society and AI placing of meal orders with the 4 order screens No big menu behind the one register so if youre elderly or suffer from Alzheimers or just plain dont remember or know their menu like the palm of your hand Well Ronald dont care But do have to say the food was A Grade Made compared to other McDonalds where they cheat you out of ingredients and the full experience of a meal
9420,3,Tastes the same everywhere in the world A testament to the power of logistics and training Had a quarter pounder meal More places around the world could use their toilet token system though deters noncustomer toilet users
9422,3,Typical good service busy and not overly clean Helpful street person opening door for us and asking us to remember him on the way out
11624,3,Its friendly enough but needs cleaning
9471,3,Chicken tenders were over cooked or precooked Kinda tough not tender or juicy
11573,3,Food was good service was slow under staffed
25446,3,Fast service maybe  a little too fast I  recommend you get them to repeat your order  Either they need better headphones or dont comprehend your order
9477,3,I eat McDonalds twice a month and not once his it disappointed mebut i would never give it more then 3 stars
11566,3,Parking lot was far too small Food was ok
9491,3,Unless I ask how much something extra costs dont tell me how much something extra costs Especially when i use the word EXTRA
25450,3,"Good people The speakers or mics are terrible
I have to fix my order at the window everytime I go here makes me think they mess up my order in the end just out of spite that they think Im changing my order every time I go

Dear Manager

FIX REPAIR or GET SOME NEW EQUIPMENT PLEASE"
9495,3,This McDonalds is okay except the homeless   men inside were a total nuisance and they only had the bottom of the restaurant open Im not sure if they have a top of the McDonalds thats open
9501,3,The service wasnt the best Messed up the order a few times
9467,3,"The cheapest meal I had on my trip to DC

Not the cleanest McDonalds Ive ever been in and they often allowed panhandlers to sit literally infront of their front doors but it served to provide cheap breakfast before the task of tracking into the National Mall each day"
11552,3,Its a fat food joint Or fast you decide
9507,3,It has a second floor dining area which is something Ive never seen in a McDonalds before
26506,3,The only reason i am giving this McDonalds a 3 is because of how dirty the bathrooms were The food was good and the arcade they had was fun I
9509,3,Fast service of the expected quality from McDonalds  The facility was shabby and I didnt feel terribly safe
26502,3,It is called the largest McDonalds in the world Exterior looks great and interior as well Two storied building with play area for the kids Mainly because of the world famous universal studio and Disney park and the other tourist facilities this McDonalds is always busy However its not among the best in terms of service quality Long waiting for the order No matter you use the kiosk or go to the counter to order your food get prepared to wait longer than usual McDonald
9513,3,Good place but those homeless people outside
11539,3,Very convenient spot  expect to wait forever on a weekend night
26498,3,The aesthetic of this location was really cool There is a huge arcade inside as well as play area for kids Two floors tons of seating an aquarium and a bunch of other cool stuff I was expecting a little better service and food quality with it being the largest McDonalds in the country It was cool to be able to order pizza and pasta since that is not something typically available at McDonalds but as expected it wasnt incredibly flavorful Prices were a bit higher than normal McDonalds as well but with all the extras at the restaurant that makes sense
9518,3,Very busy in the morning
9520,3,Needs better parking but u get hot food
26512,3,This place was HUGE  very busy All of the upstairs was a play jungle gym  an arcade along with some seating A very diverse menuthe usual but also fire oven pizza bad pasta Im giving it three because it was SO slow I know 
26641,3,The drivethru line takes forever because 1 person does both sides  But the food is OK except they always forget the juice box in the happy meal
11578,3,Too crowded but they always make the food right
25440,3,Didnt have the toys for happy meal that they had out in display disappointing for 3 yr old The jungle theme is cool esp for kids Playground was clean and fun Employees didnt seem to like their job nor people
9423,3,I went thete today for lunch abd every available table was reslly dirty  I only ordered a double cheedeburger andvdrnk and tthe food was delivered to my table pretty quickly
9425,3,Bathrooms are pretty disgusting even with a numpad lock Lots of homeless people around late at night Same food same quality Plenty of seating tho
25424,3,The staffs were wonderful  but the dining area was cramped   Too many table and chair in a tiny place  Especially for Covid season

25433,3,Not the best McDonalds Ive been too First off it could have been cleaner they needed to sweep the floors Second the staff werent the friendliest I went up to the register and the man just said not yet Never greeted me or give me a reason Then I waited like 10 mins then a lady took my order she was a bit nicer Then waited another 10 mins for my food to come I get being busy but at least be a bit friendlier or tell me theres gonna be a wait
26550,3,Neutral

9130,3,Good breakfast sandwich not friendly assistants no happy face here so be sure and give them one of yours 
26739,3,Im giving this McDonalds location a 3 star rating This was due to the fact that their fries werent all that great and meat was a bit oily in the quarter pound burger Ive also noticed that the quality of their buns arent what they used to be Not sure if Im the only one whos noticed the change
11857,3,Neutral
11855,3,Neutral

26729,3,"Google keeps bugging me to review it so here goes    Its Mcdonalds You know what youre in for when you go  Theres always a 5050 chance that your fries will be hot and delicious or cold and nasty  Ill only add that this particular McDs suffers from being next door to one of the largest homeless encampments in LA  Be prepared to be asked usually politely by a transient for food
Of course this isnt really the fault of the McDonalds and Im not making any judgements I eat here frequently since its just off the freeway near my house and McDs in general has improved their food over the past few years"
26735,3,Soda was just fizzy water Burger was undercooked Fries were good and hot
9121,3,It was slow service n cold n old burger

11840,3,Neutral
26731,3,Its McDonalds Their menu is growing and has a number of new additions that look to be a bit healthier but I come for the comfort of a Big Mac or Whopper  This location is situated in an area that limits parking and the drive through fills up the the point where it causes issues on the street Theres minimal seating although Ive always found a table It is clean and the staff the normal level of friendly and helpful

11717,3,Its mcd
9275,3,Theyve changed the ordering process and its awful people helping are considerate though

11720,3,Random people loiter here
11780,3,Not to busy
9244,3,Always have to pull around and park during drive thru Whats the point of drive thru if you have to park
26674,3,Whenever you buy at this location always check your order  seems that every so often order is missing something   With the long lines and once I leave the area I dont like to drive back
9181,3,McDonalds is all right I only come here if I want something fast and cheap and I got a hot and spicy McChicken
9184,3,It was the only place open on Christmas morning to get coffee you would think that McDonalds wood close so their employees could have a Christmas with their family
9188,3,Service was nice but food was a little overcookednot really fresh
25318,3,The accuracy of my food when I revived it was where it went bad Was missing 3 fries and 2 chicken sandwiches Everything else was fine Employees were pretty good and the place was very clean

9232,3,No indoor seating yet  Went to Astro Burger instead  Wake up McDonalds
11744,3,Slowest place ever
25341,3,It was just a random mcdonalds I stopped by it was fairly decent  Typical
11760,3,Cool place
13654,3,Worlds largest Mcdo though doesnt seem that large inside Since 6 out of 10 self order points were broken the wait was very long before being able to order The food was according to expectations
7445,3,Shake machine seems to be always out
14853,3,When the owner is there this McDonalds runs like clockwork but when hes not there service Lacks long wait times sometimes total chaos drivethru is not too bad but when the delivery truck shows up it can be a headache
28472,3,Only one inaccurate cashier working on a weekday at breakfast Had to go through line and the waits twice to get my order right Will not be back to this site
5218,3,Neutral
23797,3,I am not a great fan of McDonalds but the drivethru was quick and the food was as expected
6252,3,Nice place Tables should be cleaned more rapidly though There were several empty tables when I went but here were food drops on most of them Not quite clean
5219,3,Neutral
6251,3,"Ive been here numerous times and have no complaints about the food or the staff As mentioned in other reviews here there is a problem with the overall cleanliness of the restaurant and the transients that call the place home

Im not sure if there is a homeless shelter nearby or if people just love to hang out in the place but there are always less fortunate people there especially in the morning Just this morning Ive witnessed the NYPD escort a woman out of the restaurant that was loitering There are signs throughout the restaurant that clearly state No Loitering and that there is a 30 min time limit Now that the weather is getting colder people are just looking to stay warm

Unfortunately McDonalds is in a difficult position As a former General Manager of a fast food restaurant I used to deal with rough teenagers and undesirables especially at night I wanted my paying customers to have a friendly warm and inviting environment to eat in with their families The rough crowd made that very difficult to maintain I like McDs started with signs The McDs in this review also has full time security to help keep the people safe and moving

You see you just cant stand at the door and not allow people to come into McDs The best you can do is try to manage it I give them a lot of credit for trying to do just that I also give credit to the employees as they have to deal with it all day long As far as the cleanliness they can do a much better job there I cant speak for all the people given Lobby Duty but Ive never seen one with a cleaning bottle and rag to clean the tables So even I had to sit at a table this morning that wasnt clean It wasnt exactly disgusting but it wasnt clean either

Ive never been in the bathrooms because I try to avoid them at all costs Ive seen the people that come out of there and also the bathrooms at Penn Station down the block It cant be pleasant in there and frankly I wouldnt want to clean it either

There are other McDs in the area but this one is at times convenient for me You cant beat the price for breakfast in that area in NYC I would NEVER bring my family there But for a quick stop in the morning its ok

So the 3 stars are just for the environment the ambiance and the cleanliness The food and the staff are great its just a difficult place to eat in given the community"
28474,3,New but WAY TO BUSYNO INSTUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE NEW COMPUTER MENUS WE WAITED 20 MIN FOR OUR DONE IN GOOD
23789,3,The food here is generally good but Ive noticed that their nuggets are kind of a gamble on freshness
23785,3,It was ok as far as food from McDonalds goes The service was fast and the lady who took my order was nice
23782,3,Food wasnt the greatest and they made meet wait for something so simple and they probably could use some customer service training
6246,3,Clean however the checking of vaccine cards should be a bit better Of course this is my opinion I was asked at the time who I was with was not
28794,3,Went inside because the drivethru line was long It actually didnt matter they were just slow over all Four cars had to pull up and wait for their orders and 2 of those were only drinks
28783,3,3 stars because its hit or miss whether your order will be correct or not Or if they give you utensils to actually eat your meal 100 check your bag before you leave
14272,3,Food was way to greasy like grease dripping of the burger no napkins and fries were old and barely warm wouldnt recommend unless your just starving and on a cheap budget
23776,3,This location at this time was ok Order for my Friend was as they wanted
28780,3,Still getting things in order Kids are respectful the Manager on night shift is great Im sure she moved from the Orange City location Theyll be fine
29328,3,Slow
23775,3,McDonalds is good however theyre set up on how they take coupons causes the customer to accidentally pay normal price
13944,3,A little slow for the amount of people working Part of the food was cold Out of our family of 11 seven of our orders were incorrect or missing something Whipped cream from the waffles missing slushies missing OJ sandwiches incorrect By the time we got everything tracked down the hot food was cold It was still very entertaining for small kids but adults its only okay
5768,3,Neutral

29102,3,Food not hot sloppy sandwich
28487,3,This one is aware of food allergies so this it makes it easier for us

6159,3,The staff was rude and the food was cold
28764,3,O came through the drive though and the guy there was so nice such a pleasure to be around you could tell he definitely cared about his job to the point where I actually gave him a tip at the window he ended up selling me to buying more than what I anticipated then I got home and of course behold my food was incorrect called back spoke to the manager the manager said absolutely come back in and we will correct it which I did and steaks happened came back through the drivethru a new manager was absolutely wonderful its how you handle something that makes it worth going back or not Mistakes happen
23239,3,Took forever in the drivethruover 30 minutes and the food was sloppy They seemed pretty busy in their defense
6154,3,Not enough staff Whats the point of the mobile app They wont start preparing until you are there 22 people ahead of me 22 minutes wait time Over priced  I ate it faster then the wait time and I eat slowly
6153,3,The food was not a problem But there has to be better security While we were waiting for food a fight broke out between 4 or 5 people Very rough and scary They were pushing and yelling and several times one individual looked like he was reaching for something in a bag Took management a while to call police They finally got there but the perpetrators had left Very scary experience
13999,3,This is supposedly the worlds biggest McD I wanted to see what makes it so popular Frankly speaking its just another McD No special food Although the dessert section had sugar loaded yum desserts
29142,3,Food was cold staff unprofessional

6139,3,The quickness and efficiency is good but the quality is missing a little  The nuggets weren
14012,3,It didnt seem like the largest McDonalds in the world But it was big to the point it had an arcade and place where the kids could crawl thru tunnels and go down slides  The kids had fun I do not eat from fast food places like McDonalds Wendys Burger King etc So I cant tell you how the food taste
29148,3,Its a Mickey Ds You know already
14815,3,Nice but make sure you check your order they always make my coffee order incorrectly
13990,3,This place is massive and a mad house It was fun to  check it out and they have more than the typical McDs menu  with brick oven pizza and a dessert counter  and even an arcade room upstairs where you can earn cheap prizes Self service kiosks are nice but chaotic and a wifi location tracking number leads a server to your table to bring your food For as long as I waited and as busy as it was I expected hot and fresh food but my tenders were room temperature at best and the fries looked a day old
28516,3,They didnt get the order right but the girl gave me me what was missing But the apple pies were old and dry from sitting 
5471,3,Your typical McDonalds nothing to special
6218,3,All of the unmanned spots to purchase food didnt work so you had double the effort to buy something not cool If you have a feature thats not working turn it off till it works If they have to test it Ill give em some possible credit there This place is crazy busy usually

We made an 8500 order It was very loud as we sat on the second floor
Be sure to get your drinks on the lower level We waited 45 minutes to get our food while the kids played
When we got our order 6 of us didnt get our food
They deliver to your table It took another 30 minutes to get our food corrected
The kids had a great time We were tired Seating is comfortable and one young lady helped us finally get our order
The bathrooms were very clean
The difference between our morning trip here and the evening trip here was substantially different"
6212,3,I work pretty close to this location but I try to avoid it because of the sheer amount of homeless and drug users that visit the establishment  The lines are not usually long but they are very disorganized and the wait time for can take over 15 minutes for just a sandwich The foodpromotions was on par with other locations
14809,3,The few times I visited line was super long will not be returning

13971,3,We waited for an order we placed for more than an hour asked on several occasions if the order would be ready soon We were told that it was being prepared but it wasnt our order  They checked  again and the order was cold and had been sitting there for the longest time However one of the workers was kind enough to redo our order This was the second day of the vacation  we lived right next door Havent been back to this MacDonalds since
23743,3,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE I ordered a cone and it was a tiny pitiful looking excuse for a cone so I asked the manager who made it  handed it to me to remake it the correct size and way He said 50 centsit looked like a childs conehe said you can pay 50 cents or take the coneI kept insisting he remake ithe suggested to refund my money and I took it and went to Wendys it was crazy how rude the manager and the staff were Ive worked for mcds before and the service I received was extremely below par Never going to this mcds again
6191,3,Too many people hanging around for change
23741,3,"I always order a double hamburger with extra pickles so I expect to have at least 4 or more pickles cuz it usually comes with 3 but the two I just received only had 1 When I say extra pickle I mean extra pickle

Update I ordered the same thing again tonight but only got 1 pattie on each Last I checked DOUBLE hamburgers come with TWO patties"
28504,3,Its OK as McDonalds goes Crazy busy after the theme parks close each night Expect long waits
14601,3,It is what it is Fast food
23732,3,New employees I am ok with it but they should be able to check orders and go through the order with customers  Keep forgetting items
6178,3,Restaurant was clean and there were social distancing Its what you normally expected from a fast food joint Prices were little higher than normal but it is in Manhattan so thats to be expected Service was quick when I went there in off hours
5779,3,Neutral
5445,3,Limited parking homeless folks live nearby outside
13969,3,it was interesting to have 2 levels but i dont think it was as interesting as anticipa
14252,3,Nuggets are never fresh
13911,3,In the area above it is very hot In the playground park there were teenagers and its uncomfortable that you cant see your little children inside with the teenagers also playing upstairs I think the restaurant should take control of those who cant enter in the playground 
5742,3,Neutral
6314,3,This specific location had an incredible amount of loitering drug addicts homeless and Dirty ppl DEFINITELY AVOID THIS ONE ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC
14863,3,I have to wait for a coffee to be Brewing for 20 minutes rather than that everything it was scream really good
29369,3,It takes a long time for the order to come out

5178,3,Neutral
6294,3,So ehm what can I say Italy is the best for the food of course and the chips are offended because you use the ketchup on them and I didnt ask for them They are too much little soft and I bought them for too much Paulino is the best Anywayso I love the mec and bye
13869,3,Would have given it a higher rating but the only reason we stopped was the play area and they decided that lunch time on a Friday afternoon was the best time to close it to do maintenance
6292,3,There fast only problem they area is surrounded by ppl who do drugs like heroin crackcocaine k2 ect Not an area to bring ur kids or family too not even for tourist nothing to see there

23367,3,This MacDonalds has not once given me the correct amount of nuggets Lately its been too many but there are several times where they short me Theyve gotten my order completely wrong before too They just seem to struggle a fair amount
6304,3,The food is standard but the customers are awful  Not their fault But if you like the homeless and drug addicts  watch you eat This is the place to go
14855,3,Good food but service speed leaves a lot to be desired
29372,3,The place is very clean but the food is cold
28846,3,New employees I am ok with it but they should be able to check orders and go through the order with customers  Keep forgetting items

14878,3,Reminds me of when I was a child and my mom would take us to get happy meals
5163,3,Neutral
29375,3,It is a place to have a drink and an appetizer talk for a while with friends but I do not consider it the best restaurant
13843,3,What can you say its thr worlds largest McDonalds I was expecting that since its the worlds largest they would have some of the different McDonalds products from around the world instead the only unusual items were pizza pasta and desserts There is an arcade upstairs with fun games with a few broken ones If you want to go to McDonalds and are in the area its worth it to stop to say youve been but IMO not worth making a special trip
14549,3,Do not like kiosk

6334,3,I too have experienced people soliciting you for money male Hispanic homeless people   and other apparent derelicts Also a methadone clinic is nearby  This location needs security guards to keep out the unwanted customers
23540,3,New but WAY TO BUSYNO INSTUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE NEW COMPUTER MENUS WE WAITED 20 MIN FOR OUR DONE IN GOOD
28857,3,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE I ordered a cone and it was a tiny pitiful looking excuse for a cone so I asked the manager who made it  handed it to me to remake it the correct size and way He said 50 centsit looked like a childs conehe said you can pay 50 cents or take the coneI kept insisting he remake ithe suggested to refund my money and I took it and went to Wendys it was crazy how rude the manager and the staff were Ive worked for mcds before and the service I received was extremely below par Never going to this mcds again
6333,3,I arrive around 7am the place is packed with drug addicts  However the service and food has been good and the older lady keeps the womens bathroom very clean
28855,3,"I always order a double hamburger with extra pickles so I expect to have at least 4 or more pickles cuz it usually comes with 3 but the two I just received only had 1 When I say extra pickle I mean extra pickle

Update I ordered the same thing again tonight but only got 1 pattie on each Last I checked DOUBLE hamburgers come with TWO patties"
6323,3,"Very cold atmosphere
Cash registers unattended with customers waiting to place order
Smile was lacking whilst interacting with customers
This place needs loads if training in customer service"

14567,3,Its food I guess
23356,3,Horribleorder was all messed up I asked for my food to be freshly cookedI got cold fries
5192,3,Neutral
28810,3,There always seems to be a rush and not in a good way Obvious rush hours are meant to be hectic But when most of the staff are young and  teenageish  and rightfully so because age and mindset it a bit understandable  But not getting right items with orders or taking longer the should be to get final order is saying something Having work in the Food  Beverage industry for numerous years in various positions  I Sympathize When an Iced flavored coffee is made so sweet  with Syrup its undrinkable thats not acceptable nor is  Appreciated
13896,3,"Not the best experience in the worlds biggest McDonalds Employees were talking to each other and just screaming the order numbers It took me some time to order cause there was no employee to register my order
Although food is good as always and every McDonald offers"
14841,3,Idk know why but McDonalds just dont taste like McDonalds anymore
5735,3,Neutral
23827,3,"Disappointing
No McRib or chicken nuggets available"
14840,3,Its open and available early mornings when I get off work Breakfast is hot and ready with no waiting
6264,3,Food was up to their standard except the chocolate shake was thin and not frozen But the place was a total mess with all the tables dirty and trash all over the floor and no table numbers at the ordering kiosks One person did come out and start sweeping before we left but it seems some retraining may be in order for this location
6261,3,It was full of junkies I was holding onto my purse n couldnt enjoy my meal  Finally my daughter and I had to leave  If I were just rating the food it was hot n served quickly
23830,3,I only give it 3 strars because they need to install a cover for when its raining to make our orders so our whole car doesnt get soaked
23819,3,It was okayHave not been there in over 10 years
29351,3,It is what it is
13907,3,Fun for kids with play area and video games Food was not good Should have passed on the Philly cheese steak was just ground hamburger  Drinks were watery and Dr PEPPER didnt work at all
5487,3,Ok food
13908,3,Messed up the order Granted we had a group so it was almost expected However instead of fixing it they copped an attitude and insulted my aunt They didnt give us our drinks either and told us to go behind the counter and do it ourselves The arcade was not even half working either  Being a tourist area youd think theyd be on par
5486,3,Good and fast service
13909,3,Its a McDonalds so its pretty much the same as every other McDonalds It was busy but food came quickly Kids loved the study play but it was overcrowded so they gave up after a bit Fine if youre hungry
29083,3,I think they make a good food
13910,3,"World biggest McDonalds should also be called world slowest McDonalds  Order took over 20 minutes to reach  Im my case I had a Pizza really good  But the British ppl behind me that were concerned with the delay had  like a quarter pounder and nuggets  they also experienced  25 minutes delay

If you steadily have big traffic of customers "
29084,3,The food is the same each week but its not that good
23569,3,This McDonalds location never staffs an employee at the register to take customers orders  This results in all customers having to wait until one of the kitchen staff happens to notice the customers standing at the counter wishing to place their orders  The expressions on the faces of the kitchen staff makes it clear that they are irritated at having to interrupt their own work to go over and take customer orders  This situation has not been corrected for over 6 months resulting in annoying wait times at what is supposed to be a fast food restaurant  Hire more staff
5741,3,Neutral
23355,3,Only visited once and drivethrough so dont know anything  about the place But they where friendly
6286,3,Place was not clean and the staff not particularly gentle

28453,3,More expensive than uk maccies
14562,3,Slow very slow
6278,3,The self serve stations dont have table tags so you go through the motions only to get stuck and have to go to the counter or know to put in a random number to self order they are busy and the place is clean enough but they are under staffed
5715,3,Neutral
6275,3,McDonalds just isnt what it used to be
6274,3,Its dirty and to much people from the streets go there and ask people for money when people are eating and they dont smell good and is very expensive

5716,3,Neutral
6271,3,Attention tourists due to the high volume of homeless people the chain hired a rude BOUNCER Local authorities can not handle the increasing population of unfortunate citizens living in trains stations and NOW residing on stores andor food chains The staff EXCEPT for that individual is good First time I see this type of worker at a McDonalds franchise
5722,3,Neutral
14306,3,I think McDonalds just need better natural food This is how we die or get fat like my brother
23834,3,Im not a fan of McDonalds food but I work nearby so sometimes I walk where when I forget my lunch The managers are friendly here and that says a lot
29359,3,Its McDonalds
5189,3,Neutral
14305,3,Albeit the staff was pleasantly cordial they were as slow as molasses in January
14845,3,Just ordered a frozen coffee drink  quick service
29354,3,Its McDonalds
6272,3,Its McDonalds dont expect much and you wont be disappointed
13840,3,This one is circular  has 2 levels with multiple kiosks to order They served pasta cheese steaks  fancy desserts as week as the usual The dining room is huge along with a small area with a brick oven for fresh pizza an area with games  plenty of seating upstairs but it was so crowded you couldnt enjoy it Not worth the wait
14251,3,Lines were long both inside and out But I went in instead of going through the drive through I think it was still faster
14250,3,Not much of a McDonalds foodie but if youre in a hurry and hungry good for a quick bite
5315,3,The restaurant is actually usually very clean and nice However Im giving only 3 stars due to its setup to serve drive thru customers and not walkin guests equally While seating is usually available and clean it is very limited inside theres also limited seating outdoors
14664,3,The service is lousy You will sit in the drive thru 1015 minutes before even placing your order to get a large sweet tea and then you will wait another 1015 minutes to get it  I hate that theres not another one close If you want to wait this is the place
5388,3,Kinda bummed they got rid of a lot of their chicken options No grilled or any salads of any kind
5884,3,Speed of service was an opportunity during my stay Look like the manager was like kicking out an homeless man but he wanted water I would just give it to him cause its hot out but I guess she was looking ou
14201,3,Its the only McDonald in our neighborhood so there will be a longer wait than other mcdonlds youll go to  They hold a lot of school events which make parking very difficult to find  Other than that the people are really helpful and friendly
14723,3,Sorry The previous review for this McDonalds was actually for Als Grill  This McDonalds is on Madison across from the Oak Park Police Station It is very popular and the drive through is always busy and packedit is only a couple blocks from Chicago far west Austin neighborhood  but in Oak Park a relatively safe and attractive suburb  The fast food is like the other McDonalds  good to you but not necessarily good for you  LOL Prices are good too
29257,3,Standard but slow
5385,3,Last 4 visit I went to two different McDonald order shank still not working
6018,3,The usual stuff 
5320,3,The employees are friendly but it takes too long to place your order and then get your food
6017,3,It was incredibly cramped in the ordering area but the service was excellent and food was hot and french fries had just right amount salt
14663,3,Normally a 1 score across the board but this last visit was definitely a 5 I assume because there was a manager or rep from the corporate or home offices working This visit was like I remember from years ago Hot food pleasant employees both order screens taking orders and it wasnt even a long a line for the driver thru Even the intrusive pesky  panhandlers were gone
5885,3,"I am not happy with how dirty the bathrooms and the place is kept it is so awful that you should avoid it at all costs
I give three stars because it is very busy for majority of day so staff can be overwhelmed with all the young people causing such reckless messes in disregards to the hardworking staff and employees However the staff are rarely friendly and difficult to communicate with I felt that if my order was wrong and I told the man that took my order he would just explode on me
I felt on edge uncomfortable and the place was dirty

I think the staff are overworked and need more employees considering the traffic this place sees"
14668,3,Something about this location as the mobile app and menu boards dont match Tried to order Two Happy meals with a Combo but app kept saying not available Ordered Quarter pounder meal and got a big Mac for 25 2 Regular cheeseburgers and a Medium fries instead The fries were chewy without a crunch Quarter pounder saves this from a 2 star review Had to wait after giving my pick up number three other orders left before mine was delivered Why have an app if it makes you wait longer and 
5887,3,McDonalds is McDonalds but they have a good 2 for 6 special  There is no where to sit and the soda fountains are out of service  There are always homeless people hanging outside begging for money  Can get crowded depending on what time you go
5384,3,This is not a full features McDonalds Most of the service at this McDonalds comes through the drive through and there are only a couple of tables inside
5383,3,The ordering machine messed up our orders we wanted a plain cheese burger and a normal one and it didnt show on their screen the plain one while they were cooking it
14122,3,Waiting a while for service and food Low staff Next to a convenience gas station Big Mac had a small speck of dressing Bread was dry
6013,3,An overbusy nightmare Washrooms are likely cleaned often but cant keep up with the hordes of people ransacking them
6012,3,Unpleasant McDonalds environment does not look well kept
23613,3,Slow getting orders out 12 minutes for McDbl fries which where Luke warm
14716,3,The experience was just okay and I was not impressed today The Dr Pepper tasted water down fries was not filled to the top and the 6 piece happy meal is extra and not included if you use the buy the combo get happy meal free coupon Even though its included in the options when ordering on the mobile app Doesnt make much sense to me
28621,3,Customer service could be better But its ok in general
14196,3,Basic McDonalds but clean and staff has always been friendly
14719,3,Average McDs Small Drive thru was jam packed so I went in and almost walked out without ordering Dining section roped off Front area needs cleaning  Otherwise  in and out in under 5 minutes
29191,3,Regular mc a deed
28706,3,Computers were down workers we super patient took a bit longer than expected but what are you going to do All good staff very friendly and laughing with ir
6027,3,MacDonalds restaurant is pretty much the same as in the UK good service I recommend to invest in my country South East Africa ANGOLA we luck one of those Im willing to be the partnership
14743,3,Food is good but the smoothies always taste like coffee I dont think they clean the blenders between rinses But its always been pretty fast service
23611,3,Its a hit or miss with the people that work here Some are great and friendly Others need an attitude adjustment Sometimes 
28710,3,Not sure how this happened but they were completely out of sodas tonight Got a 10 piece wLrg 
14740,3,Its a nice building with Frank Lloyd Wright inspired designs They rarely seem to clean the tables but its fine for take out Expect to get hit up by a beggar at the doors or even inside the restaurant
28600,3,Staff is friendly  For me burger wasnt hot just warm
14097,3,How does the drive thru line not move in nearly 5 min Not saying its only employee error Som
5294,3,Good Old McDonalds at their best as usual Unfortunately timing is everything Took me 20 minutes from the time I ordered my food to get my order I couldnt figure out how they could be so crowded without even a place to sit down Unless they all had a terrible time at the cash register which kept in there after ordering Ive been to this McDonalds before its been slow before But nothing like today terribly disappointing My first five minutes I was with an inexperienced cashier So I cant blame her Before the manager to take another 15 minutes ridiculous
5297,3,Too many cars driving thru traffic mess almost always I park in 99 Ranch MarketTarget parking lot No kids play area and outside seating RIGHT next to DriveThru no plants or buffer wallseparation Only minimal indoor dining Not best of fast food places to go many other ones nearby
5394,3,Super slow
14736,3,Need help there service is very slow and when ordering a shake there machine is not working 15 minutes for a quarter pounder fry and coke
14659,3,Good snack
29260,3,Always long waits
5303,3,Customer service needs more training  Girl I said girl I meant child looked frightened to be there  Good news  I ordered 2 lg Frappes and they gave me a punch card to get a free one after buying so many  Only McDonalds Ive been to with them  So good job  And girlfriend practice makes perfect put yourself out there
14099,3,Ordered a filet of fish wextra tartar  Got a filet of fish with regular tartar sauce no cheese slice but with a slice of tomato  There isnt suppose to be tomatoes on a filet of fish  Another visit ordered large fries and 2 soft drinks  Waited over 30 minutes  I mean how hard could that be 
5874,3,Had a few McD sundeas and mcflurrys while in NY Long waits and always busy But if you need a break WC WiFi or an ice cream its there Bigger portion sizes then Europe and lots more expensive too Mango smoothie very good
6036,3,There is sufficient seating on three floors Restrooms could be cleanerand so could the rest of the premises
14731,3,This place hasnt had the tenders and fish sandwich for a minute They say they ran out but its been a while now That or they forgot to remove paper from drive thru What ever I like eating here its cozy Has a fire place and over all nice Employees are your average 21st century customer service type horrible
14660,3,It was okay
23650,3,O came through the drive though and the guy there was so nice such a pleasure to be around you could tell he definitely cared about his job to the point where I actually gave him a tip at the window he ended up selling me to buying more than what I anticipated then I got home and of course behold my food was incorrect called back spoke to the manager the manager said absolutely come back in and we will correct it which I did and steaks happened came back through the drivethru a new manager was absolutely wonderful its how you handle something that makes it worth going back or not Mistakes happen
14104,3,Very friendly and try to show respect Frys are always hot and salted The one problem we face over and over is corrrct and extra sauces for nuggets When we ask for sweet n sour we end up with bbq If we ask for extra sauce I can only think of one time it was given All in all the crew members there try to do a good respectful job
6033,3,Visit was ok The first time they didnt have what I wanted which was a Crispy Chicken Snack Wrap Their Quarter Pounders wasnt as good and I ended up throwing away some of it
5307,3,"Went through drivethru McGriddles were hot hashbrowns were cold orange juice was room temperature

LEO GETZ WAS RIGHT
DONT GO TO THE DRIVETHRU"
5308,3,Mcdonalds new blueberry pie is dope not gonna lie
29261,3,Nothing different really
5304,3,Be careful parking on the south side of the building during busy hours because the cars in the drive thru will block you in Its very tight
6039,3,I liked the service but upstairs was dirty Staff should keep tables clean
28622,3,Not professional when speaking to customers but take what you can
28625,3,Ok place to come by with family too eat clean bathroom
5966,3,The burger my husband had was fine however my chicken sandwich was disgusting It tasted old and hard The fries and sweet tea were the same as any other McDonalds obviously fresh because it sees extremely heavy traffic The ordering kiosks are super convient but you cant customize  as in you cant take onions or tomatoes off of your sandwich and of course no cash payments are accepted unless you go to the actual counter Seating is not well arranged but being 3 stories tall it can fit about 100 people I wouldnt go back
28653,3,Would get more stars if they got my order right more than 3 out of five times
23629,3,The food was alright But there was almost no one in the front To ask for something I had to stand there for almost 10 mins Maybe they are very short staffed Idk Other then that it seemed okay
5962,3,They renovated their store and its very nice and modern They staff is pretty much like all the other fast food chain out there high school kids working part time so nothing out of the ordinary They have free wifi so you can definitely take advantage of the service and surf the web while enjoying a sweet tea or something They have the basic dollar menu  sweet tea apple pies apple dippers cone and some other things but too bad they dont have the chicken sandwich or McDouble for a dollar The seating area can get packed sometimes and they dont always open the third floor to the public although it really doesnt fit that many people but sometimes you would have to wait a while for someone to finish before you can get a table and seat
14705,3,Fast food movesca bit slow Which would be fine if my fries and sandwich were hot and got my order correct Disappointed I had no pickles on my chicken sandwich which was not even warm and fries cold and waxy Very disappointed  Busy can become unbusy
28654,3,Food lovely slow service for fast food
5957,3,Holy The prices at this McDonalds is crazy astronomical compared to others The promotional Saweetie Meal is priced at 1389 here Even in hotspots like Macy
14704,3,Sometimes the service is good sometimes the service is bad Sometimes youll get your correct food sometimes you dont get the correct food you ordered But one thing is for certain they get their money EVERYTIME Im tired of the some timing so I will not come back
5910,3,Decent but fountain soda broke
5353,3,The nuggets had a nasty after taste The Big Mac was good
28682,3,This McDonalds location never staffs an employee at the register to take customers orders  This results in all customers having to wait until one of the kitchen staff happens to notice the customers standing at the counter wishing to place their orders  The expressions on the faces of the kitchen staff makes it clear that they are irritated at having to interrupt their own work to go over and take customer orders  This situation has not been corrected for over 6 months resulting in annoying wait times at what is supposed to be a fast food restaurant  Hire more staff
5334,3,The fries were soggy even after I had requested fresh fries They always forget something so check your bag before u pull away
5924,3,If youre rushing to get an early cup of coffee I dont suggest you stop here its a little while wait for just one coffee
5951,3,Its ok but so crowded by the cashier because its small
23621,3,It was good I asked for my stuff to be hot and they did I feel like regardless at lunch time 12pm stay busy But this location is so far the best to me Everybody loves McDonalds and I dont know how some people could do this everyday its been so pricey its crazy I can only maybe do it once or twice a month when I have to for work
5338,3,"Food ok

Employees at the drive thru
Should all be fired

They no nothing about people
Skills or customer service

I wont go back

Keeps happening to me"
28663,3,"The rains made a mess of the drive thru
20 minutes was ridiculous"
14694,3,Its your standard McDonalds Food is decent service fine
5926,3,Typical New York city McDonalds experience Staff is very welcoming and everyone has a hairnet on today wow even the managers
5940,3,Surrounding is not clean tables have trash on them left by customers Needs someone on the upper level to clean up tables There were no napkins or ketchup upstairs for customers to use Burgers being served without lettuce and tomato you now have to purchase this and when you do its very tiny pieces The burger meals are over priced Service was on acceptable We have to be sitting in a dirty untidy and unattractive area Worst of all why is there a sign in the restaurant telling customers you only have 30mins to eat and leave like really That sign needs to be removed Not returning to this restaurant Fix up and clean up the place
5341,3,They messed up my order and I only ordered 3 small burgers But I called and one of the managers said she will fix it for me Food was good no line at the time I went
29238,3,Nice and efficient
28669,3,Only one cashier the place was super busy waited 28 Minutes for my food it was cold worst McDonalds experience ever
29237,3,Its McDonaldswhat else can I say
5956,3,Busy and crowded took the chill from our bones 
6002,3,Typical MCD not real clean but acceptable average service limited seating at ground level more seating upstairs
5909,3,Food was typical McDonalds As far as the location goes its very busy Its usually a fight to find a table especially since the 3rd floor isnt always open The restaurant was pretty clean considering how busy they were but the restroom was horrible Felt like I needed a shower after using it If you eat here hold your restroom break for later
5360,3,Service has always been friendly Traffic flow isnt great during a rush Its a very small store with homeless hanging out around it quite often Needs a remodel
29249,3,No good
14672,3,Crew was a little slow I had to ask for napkins and water to clean the tables and they messed up our orders
5890,3,What can I say about a restaurant that sits in New York City  on the busiest day  receive your burgerfries with steam coming off the items the security guard keep away the strays Hurray Mcdonald s Yall fancy with your self serving machines
23274,3,Understaffed   slow as a result    Those that are working  are courteous and apologetic  what I dont understand is considering the location  Disney area  that this McDonalds isnt better staffed
29193,3,It
5377,3,75 workers speak Spanish only so you cant customize orders because they dont speak English
14192,3,Average Mcdonald location Long drive thru line and they were not up to date with the specials Received food that tasted kind of old and no customer service
5994,3,Very crowded location with a lot of tourist traffic Theres a lot of seating upstairs  and amenities like wireless chargers But a more expensive location and way too crowded
14712,3,Be ready to wait  Its a McDonalds so you know what to expect in regards to the good The problem at this location is the speed of service since about April In April they changed to drive thru only and have since added carry for those willing to walk in  Both the drive thru and in person wait are constantly long Most recently I went there for a Big Mac meal and it took 5 minutes before I could place my order with only 2 people ahead of me and then waited 79 minutes for my order to be done I did see 2 people that ordered after me get their orders first and neither was a smaller order
29201,3,Typical fast food place
14137,3,Always some kind of liquid on the floor Always here employees yelling at each other Place is dirty and they dont seem to clean it
5968,3,Its hit or miss here Sometimes its fast sometimes it takes forever to get your food The one thing I must say is unlike other mcdonalds they always get your order right so that is definitely a plus It is a little more expensive too because its in ManhattanChinatown If you go to the bronx or brooklyn it cost you less
5892,3,Visited a couple of times while in the area for civil court and the staff behind the counter are usually great but the security guy in the lobby or the floor manager or whatever blocked me trying to leave with my drink telling me the sitting area was upstairs when i was literally just trying to leave When I sat down here this morning a manager started harassing a customer who was sitting with a cup of coffee calling him homeless telling him he had to leave in 10 minutes and causing an argument between the guy and another customer and just walked away while they yelled at each other Not very cool 
5986,3,Went here and got a coffee and used the bathroom  Not really an ideal place to but in Chinatown theres not many options  Coffee was good but restaurant isnt the cleanest
5984,3,They didnt give condiments with the meal and when asked they were very skimpy They were pretty fast with the meal prep
28639,3,Its McDonalds atleast they are open Laure for driive through
28697,3,Some small tables are uncomfortable to sit on Service was very slow in the morning they were unable to provide table service Food was left at the counter while you were waiting at the table with your number asking yourself why was it taking so long
5981,3,I asked for an egg white delight but they were out so I got an egg McMuffin and a sweet tea The egg was underdone and still runny The tea was not sweet it just had sugar added to unsweetened tea
14681,3,Food is what is expected customer service could use more training
28643,3,Ashes for a cheese burger with no pickle or onion and even had ths sticker on the box Still had pickle and onion on it
5906,3,It was a fast stop we ordered using a touch screen which was very fast and easy you can pick from their full menu and change from selection real fast It was an order for two and we had no issues you can pay using your credit card without any human interaction chicken nuggets with a couple frappes sealed the deal for us
5974,3,Need better English speakers
5972,3,Not sure about the quality of the food I think I prefer diners more
28646,3,Its not a bad McDonalds those young kids try their best
28634,3,Ordered a 6 piece chicken nugget kids meal and was given a filet o fish in the box instead
14795,3,Cheap fast and efficient Not to bad on the road but your body might not forgive it you
14209,3,Fast service but inefficient  Forgot my boys chocolate milk with his 6 piece happy meal
5288,3,What you expect fast food period Nothing else
5245,3,Neutral
23680,3,Went inside because the drivethru line was long It actually didnt matter they were just slow over all Four cars had to pull up and wait for their orders and 2 of those were only drinks
14631,3,Decent
5418,3,Its inexpensive fast food but it tastes reasonably good
28735,3,It was good I asked for my stuff to be hot and they did I feel like regardless at lunch time 12pm stay busy But this location is so far the best to me Everybody loves McDonalds and I dont know how some people could do this everyday its been so pricey its crazy I can only maybe do it once or twice a month when I have to for work
14046,3,Its McDonalds lol Not much to say except at this location the fries are usually cold We dont live that far to where they would get cold on the way home
14786,3,Oktodayworker need to be friendlier THEY NEED TO PLEASE GET MY ORDERS RIGHT THEY KEEP GIVING ME THE WRONG ORDERI START CHECKING AT THE WINDOW AND THEY STILL GET IT WRONG THEN GET A ATTITUDE WOW
28729,3,Its a hit or miss with the people that work here Some are great and friendly Others need an attitude adjustment Sometimes 
29167,3,Clean and cashier was polite
29170,3,Slow service food is cold
5247,3,Neutral
5421,3,Small venue  smaller than usual menu Had the feeling of a food court version of the restaurant but in a major shopping center
14782,3,Teenagers rudely upset my evening there  They were disruptive loud and disrespectful and staff said nor did anything  One customer spoke up and they finally left   Will be taking my food to go moving forward
14231,3,Menu did not have all the sandwiches it displayed in addition  the menu need to remain static so that people  can clearly  make a informed choice
29290,3,Like dollar choice
23254,3,Very deception what would everything thats done okay you go online then you got to go you go online and then then when you get there so its a cop car order they looking at anything the way it should be looking at they say its a big game its like a game that would have been cheaper for me to buy whats on special than it was to use the app
28565,3,Nuggets were disappointing compared to the UK
14639,3,Slow today
6086,3,"I am a college student who likes to study or review in a noisy area but yesterday I was just about to do the same thing on this place when I decided to finish eating first before doing all my homework but I received a a long distance callit was from my long lost cousin We ended up talking and catchingtill my battery ran out As I was starting to get ready with my homework one of the staffs told me that I have been there for more than 5 hours I was like really  He said yes and I was supposed to stay 30 minutes only but I was been there for more than 5 hours

Now I didnt exactly notice what time I came in but when I look on the time it was around 6pm or so I asked the security guard if I can stay to do my homework he said Im sorry

I understand they were just doing their job So I left When I was outside I was hey I could have bought another food and stay Anyways I just left"
14230,3,Keep getting screwed on my fries TWICE in a row they were half full and not that fresh  The nuggets are nuggets
14054,3,they always forget the sauce when you ask for them  check your bags before you leave the drive thru
23670,3,3 stars because its hit or miss whether your order will be correct or not Or if they give you utensils to actually eat your meal 100 check your bag before you leave
5407,3,Fries were reheated The guy who took order messed it up but staff overall was very nice
23297,3,Food was good but it took 3540 mins to get it through drive thru
14638,3,Coffee was bitter
14642,3,Not to bad
28563,3,Was enjoy my birthday breakfast  until i bit down into egg shells   great way to ruin a meal and a sandwich

5790,3,Neutral
5794,3,Neutral
14017,3,Its McDonalds on steroids lol never have I  thought pizza and pasta be on the menu here Wish I tried it before leaving the area but it was very chaotic inside
14246,3,They got our order wrong multiple times and in the end they did not get it right so they gave us 2 free cookies and 2 free pies
23593,3,Computers were down workers we super patient took a bit longer than expected but what are you going to do All good staff very friendly and laughing with ir
28537,3,Rushed us while ordering and mess up our Order twice while in the area for vacation
5428,3,Chicken mc griddle were so good
29156,3,Service is very slow
28743,3,The food was alright But there was almost no one in the front To ask for something I had to stand there for almost 10 mins Maybe they are very short staffed Idk Other then that it seemed okay
29301,3,It stays busy
14020,3,While this is a fun mcdonalds with a huge Playland and an arcade the service is lacking We ordered and they bring your food to you We waited at least 20 minutes went to the counter to check and then they gave us only part of what we ordered I went back and got the rest no apology no compensation
23597,3,Not sure how this happened but they were completely out of sodas tonight Got a 10 piece wLrg 
23697,3,There always seems to be a rush and not in a good way Obvious rush hours are meant to be hectic But when most of the staff are young and  teenageish  and rightfully so because age and mindset it a bit understandable  But not getting right items with orders or taking longer the should be to get final order is saying something Having work in the Food  Beverage industry for numerous years in various positions  I Sympathize When an Iced flavored coffee is made so sweet  with Syrup its undrinkable thats not acceptable nor is  Appreciated
6122,3,I like it service good  its Cheaper the most of the places around lol

28546,3,Good food not to crowded Yes its really a mc donalds
6111,3,McDonalds was clean And staff friendly Their security guards are absolutely crazy and ghetto They were screaming over and over and multiple people left because of it
14627,3,Always slow
23684,3,Got there in time for breakfast I cant believe I paid so much for egg McMuffin It will probably be my last and I will make my own at home from now on
6106,3,They have this broken system where if you select to eat there instead of to go they ask for a table number thats nowhere to be found You waste minutes trying to figure it out if you ever do I gave up and just made up a number from 1 to 120
6104,3,Staff is nice and helpful but it was not the cleanest branch I visited
6103,3,Lots of people who are obviously under the influence of something are there being loud obnoxious the bathroom was filthy amongst other things such as people openly selling contraband or I should say illegal items Not a particularly family safe enviroment
14024,3,The food was good except my husband found a hair on his sandwich They have pasta pizza and different desserts in addition to the regular meal There is a huge play area and arcade upstairs Its fun but nothing special I felt the food was a tad over priced considering our regular sandwich meal was 10 each
5395,3,Your average McDonalds They kept it clean and its a good area of town Very quiet
6078,3,Its McDonalds there not allot that you can review the food was good and the options were great
14779,3,Currently under construction so done in is unavailable Despite having crew members outside to run orders the drive thru is frequently backed up into Madison Street
14219,3,What can I say its McDonalds Food was as expected however everything cost a bit more then Im used to from McDonalds
28595,3,Typical McDonalds
5397,3,Smallish restaurant Fast service Have kiosks No play area Outdoor seating available
29274,3,Great service 
14759,3,Sometimes its a hit or miss with the food  Undercooked fries or fish  Luke warm food beverage cups not filled up 34 fries in the package  But they will correct it with no problem  The attitudes are always A
6049,3,My entire order was wrong and it took forever for them to fill the order in the first place But I complained and the owner gave me a lot of coupons
14218,3,Ate chicken nuggets which were surprisingly good Im picky about my nuggets Fries sucked Soggy and no salt on them Threw them away Honey mustard sauce was good
29270,3,Only go for breakfast
5396,3,So far no food poisoning Theres a random man who comes at around night time and sometimes tries to talk to you
5853,3,Good place just to grab some food and eat outside for a cheap price Respectfully homeless people come inside to beg often Not really a family place If two guys are hanging it is okay The workers are not really attentive so check your orders
28719,3,Long lines and when did Mikey Ds get so expensive My granddaughter wanted a McFlurry and the ice cream machine wasnt working Are those machines ever in working order Alt Spgs McDonalds on 434 by Walmart is just as bad with their machine being broken numerous times Very frustrating
5850,3,On Canal St very busy so expect a line inside  The kiosk machines help order ahead Homeless people are around but not inside They are only trying to get a meal no problem Charity is a blessing to those less fortunate
14654,3,Bad restroom
29266,3,It was ok
14753,3,Sorry there was a time when you could whiz thru the drive thru with no problem Now you need a translator for five minutes were trying to clarify tea  cheese
5282,3,Driest English muffin ever They never suggest a deal
29264,3,Ok
14749,3,I ordered a hamburger and when I unwrapped it there was no ketchup or anything on one side The other side had a dab of ketchu mustard 1 pickle and a sprinkle of onion It was good though Very spacious and cozy
6043,3,I get my order very fast but one time they didnt put french fries in my order when I ordered them
14655,3,Okay
28714,3,This particular McDonalds has terrible drive thru service and has for years
14214,3,Pretty fast for a breakfast rush
23608,3,I felt bad for the employees They were obviously stressed and the manager seemed to be hiding from the irate customers It took 20 minutes to get food at 4pm on a Monday  I was given the wrong sandwich and the fries were hard
5870,3,It depends what time of day you come here Its cool due to their touch screens but at night the homeless call this home
28598,3,Drive thru experience Staff was very friendly Food was cold when it was delivered Fries were very salty
28726,3,Slow getting orders out 12 minutes for McDbl fries which where Luke warm
28722,3,I felt bad for the employees They were obviously stressed and the manager seemed to be hiding from the irate customers It took 20 minutes to get food at 4pm on a Monday  I was given the wrong sandwich and the fries were hard
5845,3,Very busy spot people begging at the door for money and at least they opened the upstairs and the bathrooms again so you can actually sit and eat without stressing where to go after you order Very clean did exactly what I asked for my order and always friendly Been going here for a while when I used to work around the corner before the whole COVID19 changed everything But its a place if Im around that area Id walk there to eat instead of Checkers   or 99cent pizza depend if your in the mood for it
6077,3,Great location but dont expect a friendly customer service
28572,3,Not enough help Food wasnt fresh
23666,3,Still getting things in order Kids are respectful the Manager on night shift is great Im sure she moved from the Orange City location Theyll be fine
14644,3,Could be better
23255,3,Food is slow to arrive 17 mins for a mc double  Most of the Management team is horrible and rude The young shorter Hispanic lady manager is an asset and needs to be recognized
5252,3,For a McDonalds this location isnt bad Its renovated with artistic walls that creates a more inviting atmosphere When I went on a Monday evening the space was clean with plenty of corners to sit Service was a bit more friendly and faster than expected
23601,3,This particular McDonalds has terrible drive thru service and has for years
14645,3,Its was ok
14069,3,Dining room is still closed and as a result the drive through line is routinely 1520 customers deep  Runs more efficiently than in the past  Customer service at this location has improved noticeably in recent months  Courteous and friendly at every visit  Order accuracy has also made a trend for the better
5842,3,Its a small McDonalds comparing to other Very few seating and small seating area Service and menu is same like other McDonalds may slight high price Location is precious customer moderate at the morning Customer service good
28578,3,This location has closed seating and has take out only
14764,3,I remember coming here as a child in between church services We got a chance to play in the Playland Brung my son here to share the experience its not here anymore There was nice upgraded layout Upon walking in there was this foul odor of something similar to medicated human feces
5405,3,They dont serve breakfast all day Very disappointing
14649,3,Fair
14077,3,Drive through is okay maybe online order inside but to order at the counter is like visiting a prisoner through glass during visiting hours So uncomfortable I just cant support McDonalds at this time not intil they get over their very twisted views on the current situation Maybe you agree with their myopic and archaic views can you hear me all the way back on 1899 but for me and my family we want to go somewhere thats alive inviting atmosphere and fun not a funeral  RIP McDs customer service you shall be missed 20192022
23605,3,Long lines and when did Mikey Ds get so expensive My granddaughter wanted a McFlurry and the ice cream machine wasnt working Are those machines ever in working order Alt Spgs McDonalds on 434 by Walmart is just as bad with their machine being broken numerous times Very frustrating
23258,3,Slow service Car park was rammed and difficult to move around due to the drive through vehicles being in the waynot really the fault of the restaurant except they could mark the lanes out better in the car park
28591,3,Very slow service and tables werent wiped down or cleaned
14082,3,"Honestly its okay but for some reason we always have bad luck and get brown andor old fries Also they always close earlier than what google or their store says theyre open till
Most of their employees are nice Some are just blah But they"
6054,3,Good food most of the time but do not like the antihomeless people atmosphere Not appetizing
5258,3,Pretty decent McDonalds to get decently priced food in the heart of Lower East Side The interior is super spacious there are kiosks built into the walls and the bathroom was super clean Unfortunately they closed the second floor for reasons unknown It was also super busy when I went Friday Night so the orders took an extremely long amount of time to prepare over 1520 minutes
5399,3,Order was wrong Took forever to get one item remade
28594,3,We went few times at this restaurant and it is the worst service we received  Very slow and leasy
5259,3,Not much for expectations when you enter any NYC McDonalds This one is aesthetically pleasing having recently been updated Clutch location for fast food anytime
29179,3,Fast food whats therw to say
23194,3,Dont like to order on a machine
23624,3,They need to work on their service at drive thru
6344,3,Its not a good MD for familyIts clean well lit and service great but people hang out with our foodor a 3 hour bag of fries
13754,3,The service is always great here All the employees always seem willing to help you but with the volume this store does I dont believe they have enough staff Saw a roach crawling on the 2nd floor and all of the food we got was cold by the time we got it Condiments are hard to find unless you go to the register area where 75 other people are in line waiting for their food and food is marked up in price because it is a tourist acctraction Is a cool experience once or twice but a couple miles down the road is a regular McDonalds that has fresh food every time for the same price as a regular McDonalds
23147,3,Included in my bill items I did not order
29038,3,"My daughter loves happy meals
And I usually get breakfast"

But pretty slow fast food but without the fast"
29494,3,Neutral
13726,3,There are foods that are offered that are not offered at typical McDonalds locations but do not be fooled The food is similarly mediocre to all the other locations Young children will beg to use the arcade which is certainly not any less than a cash grab Sure its fun but it doesnt offer anything more than a normal McDonalds besides a small moneydemanding arcade small pizzas a few different breakfast items and some cool desserts Otherwise its a cool place to eat if you are wise with your money
6459,3,They always get my friday coffee order incorrectly when i order at the register Best use the selfserve machine
13728,3,The fries werent salted or flavoured very bland I also had a chicken bacon burger which was heavily fried and didnt taste that good I ordered in store myself and it was quite busy people were lining up or waiting everywhere It was also unclear who worked there and who didnt as some people had no uniform but were wandering around behind the counter They also serve pizza and pasta where you can choose your toppings and sauces The ice machine was under pressure and couldnt spit ice out fast enough the second one didnt work at all and the sweet tea was pouring too slowly so I went with something else instead

Now this is what happened to me When you make your order at the screen and you order pizza or pasta it is done at a different food station from where they do the regular food After a few minutes I got the pasta at my table but the rest of the order was missing Sadly they lost the rest of my order happy meal and a coffee After 20 minutes I talked to the manager about my order and she didnt  hesitate to help me She was very nice and she personally took care of my order

22792,4,This is a pretty automated McDonalds Probably one of the most automated ones Ive come across Many of the customers went strait to the devices shown to enter their order and just stood near the pick up counter for their order I felt the process was still a bit slow given that the emphasis is for automation though Plus the area to stand was congested since it

20350,4,"Ok here complaint You serve breakfast bisque bacon egg and cheese But you dont serve bacon egg and cheese bagels after 12pm
I find that unacceptable its on your menu and you are a business that is seeking to make a buck You seek to have positive numbers on your income So why it is such big deal that you cant serve me a bagel after 12pm Im the customer and put money in your pocket You need to rethink your way of treatment of your customers I can buy anything on your menu at anytime"

30035,4,Ordered two plain fish sandwiches with no cheese or  tartar sauce due to a dairy allergy When I got to the pick up window  they had put slices of cheese in both sandwiches I returned them and had to sit and wait for the order to be corrected  Unfortunately this happens constantly no matter what McDonalds I go too Its clear the prep team simply isnt paying attention to the instructions on the orders
20545,4,Busiest place but good to wait for the service and food
29028,4,Although doing construction  at drive thru wait time was not long
23324,4,Everything seemed a little dry and our fries were only lukewarm

32492,4,Well managed and the food is good Take it from an ex McDonalds employee
25319,4,Very very very slow service shame on this store it took 12 minutes to cook a quarter pounder when on the paper only takes about 4 minutes if you use the press 2 12 minutes  I worked in Boulder city Nevada as an assistant Mgr And we had 2 minutes to get one order out and 1 minute special orders so I dont get it but On the other hand visit there if you are not in a hurry otherwise dont even try it because Fast Food Restaurant IS NOT

22943,4,"This McDonalds usually ROCKS
They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under 20 min

Tonight  there was no line Also the inside was closed AND  THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKENSHUT OFF SHOCKER

My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat So thats why we went

Then they didnt put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off 2 u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot
So I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do 2 uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag She said No we cant do that
REALLY I have worked in the food industry for 28 years  I am well aware of what you can and can not do
You didnt WANT TO You didnt want to value me as a person a customer  or a future You didnt want to do your job properly in the 1st place You didnt want to apologize in any way shape or form

I dont mind that a mistake was made I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with

There are 22 other fast food locations in the quarter mile radius"

29459,4,Good 
33217,4,If the app gives you the option to select a table THEN THEY TAKE IT TO THE TABLE They still get annoyed because they called me by the order number when I was sitting at the other end and didnt even notice until I complained to them 35 minutes later Either they correct the app or better train the staff
29461,4,Good 
25944,4,Place is very clean The new way to order with the touch screen is very cool very modern The food is exactly what you would expect Very tasty The only downside was that you can only get napkins from one place near the kitchen so you have to get up to get them

22981,4,The drive thru lane was fastWhen I got the meal it was fresh  and  taste it goodBut the only thing the orange juice was warm and the coffee they put their milk and sugar but it was no sweet enoughAlso they forgot to give us ketchup
22957,4,This location just recently allows you to dine in But there are like 2 thirds of the seating unavailable  The selfservice screen were not accepting card payments so you need to complete transactions at cashier anyways defeating the purpose of contactess ordering

23185,4,I love McDonalds  Been in my life all my life  No bigger disappointment than waiting for my meal and getting lukewarm fries  This one gave me lukewarm fries after I waited 15 minutes for my meal  I hold McDonalds to a very high standard and for me the fries make the meal  No exception

29442,4,Good 
25980,4,This is what I call one of those 5050 places the food quality is always good its the people inside specifically sometimes you have homeless sitting at a table or a very loud bunch of drunk adults  kids I dont mind thats what they are suppose to do there is nothing they can do but I still get my order and eat at my scooter outside not fun but what can you do
33193,4,Regular
22971,4,The service is good and food is fresh  the only bad thing  is just that its always packed because is a tourist area
22974,4,Best icecream ever  vanila cone
23157,4,"Read down place has changed a lot Getting to be excellent place to go

Not good new construction is nice But understaffed Even at 23am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage Also the floors heavily littered Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant but alot of foreigndomestic vacationers are just filthy They just drop food and wrappers everywhere When they are done eating they just get up and leave
Hostbusser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs More register coverage for the guests When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient
I have had 23 errors in my 8 visits First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sundays yes 2 of them
I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left The 2nd error wasnt caught till we where eating the Sundays at home I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both Yeah it was only 1 and some change but it was the principal
I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home I always request 2 plastic bags for my food because the one paper bag they put my 68 burgers fails halfway home The 2nd one is for the 3 Sundays

Another epic failure ordered 2 mcdouble no mustard and onions 2 bacon mcdouble  and 2 mcdouble regular Received the 2 mcdouble womustard and onions no problem 2 bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail 2 regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail 2 large fries ordered and received 2 medium sized fries and 2 of the smallest sized fries Ive ever seen guess they where kids sized fail The 20 peice fry came without incident Less than 12 of the whole order came correctly

25751,4,"Good quite place with good costumer service
"
23058,4,Excellent location with a large playground and plenty of seating for adults The food is your typical McDonalds fare with nothing special to write about They have a large parking lot and the bathrooms were clean during my visit My only recommendation would be for the managers and employees to meet up behind the restaurant or in the break room instead of right in front of one of the main doors of the restaurant It made the place look like a corner store and cheapens the image of this brand Their service was top notch and although they were packed during this visit the food came out fresh and without any delays
29504,4,Good 
23062,4,It can get tight getting inside when theres a delivery truck next to the store Most especially when youre going towards the drivethru

25882,4,Its a very nice renewed place Its a shame that some homeless sleep inside the restaurant
29594,4,Good 
33267,4,It is unpleasant that they are constantly towing cars in your parking lot and then the owners of the cars enter the premises claiming in an incorrect way I understand that the parking lot is only yours for your clients like me but I think you should find another solution to this problem I think that behind all this there is a business with the grueros because I go to the place every day and on more than 10 occasions just someone parks their car and in a second the tow truck appears that they have hidden in the street behind the place the service of the place is 5 stars I will continue visiting the place perhaps they should make bigger signs in each parking lot that they should not leave the car in that place thanks for the opportunity of my comment because many times I have wanted to do it again thanks
25649,4,Keke is the best i appreciate her great service kindness n patience Young lady with a great future ahead Thanks KEKE
25878,4,Fairly clean majority of the time I guess that depends on whos working But the customer service is pretty fair in all my experiences here For a quick bite I prefer this specific McDonalds Food is always fresh And I never have to ask for napkins
25652,4,Very good pretty punctual theres some issue with the ordering ordering screen and the timing of all of that
33278,4,It seemed that the service was delayed despite the fact that there were not many peopleotherwise fineclean and complying with health protocols
33280,4,"Its very good during the day there are older Latina ladies who are very cool but not at night and the place is not so nice
Im surprised that McDonalds promotions in the USA are so bad"
29483,4,Good 
33259,4,The employees lack customer service skills and are very slow preparing food The selfservice line was long and the attention inside was almost nonexistent The food was fine
25895,4,Here you can order from a big touch screen and they bring the food to your table Its also possible to order in advance through the app and they bring you order to your car
29481,4,Good 
33254,4,Good place very good attention
25930,4,When your hungryits the place to go
22999,4,Excellent and fresh hot food  The inside is spacious and clean Friendly staff but I dont like the system where you have to order by yourself with the large touch pad makes it hard to customize your order and confusing  Id rather just wait in line and have the attendants take my order like most McDonalds  But at this McDonalds you must order at the touch pad by yourself

23140,4,This particular McDonalds across from Old Town is a hit or miss and I went to try the new chicken strips as an entre with my 4 chicken sandwich meal  Before I left the lot from the drive through I checked everything The strips needed more cook time my opinion so I brought them inside and made the request Now its McDonalds you should expect some kickback or something but to my surprise I was really shocked and amazed that the order lady took it told the MOD and he says he can take care of it he just needed about 5mins I told him no problem and waited Now when I did receive it he made sure he gave it to me and when I got home to my surprise added an extra strip 4 of 5 stars because the chicken sandwich was very delicious and the service blew me away but the strips I just didnt like

23005,4,We came here twice during our visit to the area The first day I would have given them 5 stars the service was fantastic and despite being extremely busy they gave great attention to each guest The second time however we came through the drive through and the service was terrible It was very early in the morning there were only a few other cars in line maybe 3 in front of us and we were in line for at least 15 minutes

29788,4,Good 
20022,4,Good 
26416,4,"They literally almost got the entire order wrong would not come back ever My family got two deluxe s round egg 1small decaf coffee 2 med coffees with sugar and cream We ended up with packets of ketchup no bread for the muffins in the deluxesno hashbrowns and the wrong amount of cream

Ok sorry I actually came back the other day and the food was amazing this time Also there is another McDonalds in my area thats pretty lame This place has a better service overallsort of long review sorry"
20018,4,Good 
29291,4,Great restroom
26415,4,The food was fast and good for McDonalds The inside seating area was kinda small and there were a lot of homeless people hanging out in front of the building The entrance smelled like urine
20014,4,Good 
20012,4,Good 
25506,4,Its the perfect place to finish a long day at the Dallas Zoo This animal themed McDonalds has a very large play ground area and plenty of tables and seats to watch the kids while they play The food and service was adequate although the bathroom could have been a a little cleaner All in all its different enough and the kids liked it enough that we will likely come back after our next visit to the Dallas Zoo
23251,4,This is a very clean and nice McDonalds Conveniently located Easy on and off the highway
26420,4,The restaurant was clean and orderly Food was prepared fast and made properly Everything was decent
26422,4,The recently advertised 100 real meat patties for their Quarter Pounder burger more or less was what you expectsame great taste same great value though it did not fail it however didnt feel any different from their other burger options on their selected menu  Would I get it again  Yeah why not  Makes for a mouth watering meal on the go quick to be served and ready in minutes with that first warm juicy bite followed by a second third and maybe fourth  Who knows really  Just Get It and Try One Out Today or When the Munchies hit Mount Everest peaks
26424,4,Its mc donalds what can i say
25495,4,Busy place but the people who served us were friendly and polite More expensive than other McDonalds I visit I am guessing this is because it is near the Dallas Zoo
23256,4,Right across the road from Seralago Hotel this was a great spot to walk over to and grab a quick cheap breakfast Its also situated in the strip of gift shops and across from Old Town amusement park so it is very convenient to eat at when visiting those places
29280,4,Just Mickey Ds
29285,4,Quick snack stop
29802,4,Good 
29800,4,Good 
26433,4,They get you in and out fast I love this McDonalds adjacent to the beach  and the Metro Expo Line
20129,4,Good 
32853,4,Same as any other McDonalds Very busy due to its location
20048,4,Good 
26430,4,Its an interesting location for a McDonalds and this property must be super expensive Aside from that its a good enough place and I give it 4 stars based on the expectations that come from a McDonalds to begin with If youre on the Pier and you want a big Mac or some mcnuggets this is your spot
26429,4,Lines can be long but service is friendly Sometimes it takes longer for the food to come out but the employees compensate by doing extra for the wait The employees do practice good customer service
26427,4,The interior of store has recently been upgraded and has made it a lot more pleasant to be in Due to its proximity to the Pier there are still plenty of weirdos and homeless people hanging out in and around the store
26850,4,Nice customer service free WiFi and they even have outside seats small parking lot though Overall good experience
29799,4,Good 
32854,4,Fine but dirty bathroom
20050,4,Good 
29292,4,Love  love  love this place
20131,4,Good 
25469,4,I liked it cause its right by the zoo and my daughter loves to play but the staff there can be a bit abrasive after a zoo event like the Halloween trick or treat event they we understaffed and ran out of a flavor of soda and large drinks and I payed for a large but only got a medium they should have just made the fries large but the guy running the register seemed kinda new
26542,4,Good 
29869,4,Most interesting McDonalds that Ive ever been It features a fish tank an arcade and serves pizza and pastas Great place to visit as it is very unusual and interesting However do avoid going there past 1030pm as it go
20222,4,Good 
20221,4,Good 
26540,4,Good 
25442,4,This is a wonderful wildlife themed location right next to the Dallas Zoo and perfect for bringing children for lunch before heading off to the zoo The staff is always friendly here the management is good and the restaurant is much cleaner and well run than most McDonalds in the area Prices are typical of the food chain service is fast and the food is usually above average for fast food Cant go wrong here especially with the kids They will love it
20218,4,Good 
25444,4,Very nice fancy CLEAN restrooms thats a plus Very clean lobby area and nice play area for children just no hooks on the restroom doors to hang our coat jacket or purse Overall its a well managed McDonalds compared to others I seen  A1 rating I also love the Dallas Zoo theme Its a tourist attraction Thank you McDonalds for your professionalism in management and customer service Please put restroom door hooks up for our coat jacket diaper bag andor purse thanks

29864,4,Tried ordering at the drive thru but the manager that was helping the drive thru operator apparently is unaware of the current bogo 1 promotion told me I had to order 2 to get the promotion  so had to go inside and order thru the totens to be able to place my order including the promotion Besides that all clean food was good and service inside was outstanding

25432,4,This was a good McD They made a good product that wasnt smashed in a bag and thrown out the window They actually salted the fries thats a lost art anymore And the girl at the window was sweet and full of smiles Obviously a happy crew does better work
29888,4,Dreamthis place was amazingI mean the food was expensive but really good and the arcade had amazing games but unfortunately the prize room was closed cuz of COVID but this was a good experience
20246,4,Good 
29883,4,When youre hungry almost anything tastes good Thankfully their food was fully cooked unlike other locations
25434,4,Ive used the drive through only Service is great I love the outd
32798,4,The drive truth is fast and the food is fresh
26549,4,Good 
29881,4,Cool place to visit Workers were very rude and got multiple orders wrong while we were there
25438,4,I like coming to this location the morning team is always kind  friendlythe night team has more younger team members some of them have great customer servicebut the only thing that stopped me from rating 5 stars the point system Ive had trouble several times adding my code to gain point for my purchase and reached out to McDonalds customer service and was told someone would contact me but that hasnt happened 
29878,4,The food was served fast but the time in the drive thru was very long It is clean and friendly staff

26507,4,This location is nice and they deliver the food to your table Only 4 stars though because the food was cold when it arrived Probably would have given it 3 stars but I got 2 extra nuggets in my happy meal
29255,4,Its ok
26504,4,"This place is huge Large play place and fun arcade

Pizza at McDonalds Yup we tried it Overall it was delicious and had great flavor although the crust was a little thin for my liking

Overall fairly clean floors were a little sticky Bathrooms were clean"
22812,4,"Update Megan is still here and amazing as ever She joyfully asked if she could get us refills YES They offer refills again Yay You just have to ask in case shes not there Fashima and two other gentlemen working were also very friendly and even offered to help carry my food to the table Almost like we were at a real sit down restaurant the way they took care of us Thank you The only thing was that the quarter pounder seemed small and was overcooked and dry But we will be back

Megan was very friendly and helpful with ordering If give her 5 stars we dont do refills here What So the funny thing is they are moving to have you order at the kiosk but you need to ask for the refills which they dont do because the beverage machine is shut down Just so you know when you go"
20156,4,Good 
23270,4,It was very crowded but the service was fast and the food was fresh
20152,4,Good 
26501,4,"World largest McDonalds Food is the same they have pizza and pasta too The seating and ordering process was quick and easy but actually getting the food on time together was a challenge

Our burgers came in fairly fast 10 minutes or so but pizza took 30 minutes from the time when we ordered it I had to come down and ask for my order for them to give me the pizza

Honestly this worth a single visit especially the playground if you have kids If you looking for a quick bite I would go to the other locations with less people and quicker service"
29258,4,Its ok
26497,4,This McDonalds is one of the nicest and coolest McDonalds Ive ever been to It is a two story McDonalds with a play place and an arcade They offer non traditional menu options such as build your own pasta ravioli pizza cake cheese cake etc it truly is a one of a kind McDonald
25462,4,Im guessing that this location is a training hub or something It seems like its always some kind of trouble when it comes to order food show code on app for food pay and go Sheesh 
26494,4,The staffs were very friendly and our food was good The facility was clean They were very busy and our food was was good However our food was not delivered until about 30 minutes after we placed our order We wanted to try McDonalds pasta I
26492,4,The food was great Service was quick They forgot napkins and ketchup for my to go order

26511,4,"Worlds biggest McDonalds They serve Pizza and Pasta here I tried them both
To be honest I didnt know what to expect from the pasta but I guess i"
20167,4,Good 
25456,4,McDonalds is McDonalds Consistent menu food quality What sepates this location from others is decor and friendly staff that do a great job with order taking getting it out quickly and keeping area clean Besides the large play structure this location is an extension of the zoo experience with  models of a giraffe nibbling leaves from a tree containing a huge snake a  touchable cheetah statue and chatterbox chimp Great place to go with kids
26513,4,Very cool place got food on menu you will not see at any other McDonalds  The pasta was cool but not the best Service was really good  Had a good time
29859,4,This McDonald
22806,4,There are two lanes of drive through I ordered on the mobile app while waiting in line  When I got to the speaker  they didnt bother to ask my order  or order number  They just kept taking people from the other line I know that sometimes happens  they forget the order cars pull up But not 4 in a row As they started taking the 5th car  I pulled into the line and went to the window  Food was OK when I got it  But waiting 30 minutes for that to happen in the drive through isnt cool
26527,4,Carmel Frappe should have it own line
20186,4,Good 
23273,4,Great place to have a cup of coffee If you are on the keto diet McDonalds has whipped butter Yes its real butter Along with half and half You could ask for whipped cream Believe me there coffee tastes much better with butter  and cream in it   They do not have Stevia  They can make you a keto breakfast Which is eggs bacon and sausage layered
26522,4,Great place for the kids playground  and playroom are great I recommend  you the 30 min for just 5 play card while waiting for your food it can take longer that other McDonald very busy place
20182,4,Good 
25470,4,I love going to this McDonalds by the Dallas Zoo cause they have these animals that make noise and look like a jungle in there Today we were there around 7pm and the cashier and the manager were so nice to us and they even talked to my kids and made sure that we got everything we asked for The only thing I didnt like was that for the happy meals for my kids they got the same toy and it was a girl toy I have a girl and a boy so my son got a girl toy I know why McDonalds do this but its not the employees fault
26521,4,"Not entirely sure what I expected when going to the worlds largest McDonalds  I mean its just a fast food place right Wrong

The place is huge  brick ovens for thin and crispy pizzas hand crafted pasta and speciality meal stations the everyday McDonalds kitchen then followed by a staircase to an arcade playhouse and more sit down area

The pizza was only 10 after toppings It was a small personal pie  thin and crispy b"
26520,4,"The food was quality but service took a while

I liked the food a lot I had heard of the location having pizza and pasta so I got both I also got a large fries a burger and drinks Me and my party enjoyed the food and honestly the pizza was in some ways better than other pizza places

Only con
Id recommend going through the drive through and not getting the special items only because the wait when you order pizza or pasta is increasing fast Not sure if this is a regular issue but seems like when I have gone its like this"
26518,4,This was a great experience I was staying at Orlando for a week and this was one of the places I wanted to go to The pizza was really good Mac tonight was also there which was mind blowing My only complain was the pizza was pretty greasy but other then that I would recommend this for people staying at Orlando
26517,4,Well I guess I checked something off my bucket list I didnt even know I had The WORLDS biggest McDonalds How cool Pasta on dishware  at McDonalds Yes please The place was a madhouse but worth it for the experience It was our first night visiting Orlando so we didnt let our kiddo run around the H U G E play area I know kinda mean But the amount of children in it and not knowing how often it was cleaned had me a little nervous Definitely worth the visit even for just a cheeseburger And KUDOS to all employees this place is NUTS AND a drivethru Bless yall
26514,4,Overall a good experience at this McDonalds the largest in Florida if not the country a very big place I actually did not go upstairs to the arcade area just ate and ran But additional options here pizza and pasta I had both and both equally good   A little longer wait for those items so expect the additional cook
20175,4,Good 
32805,4,Fast and goodall cleanI like it
23272,4,Only place open late on a week night so the wait time was extremely long
20181,4,Good 
20007,4,Good 
26412,4,Ecofriendly flatware restroom is locked up tight transients Employees are dismissive and arrogant Not courteous and refuses to answer questions about food products ie whats on a cheeseburger answer would be Cheese  bread But the food is hot and fast

19828,4,It is a very nice place
26312,4,Its a Nice McDonalds due to location you can grab a small amount of food and go to the pier also people talk about beggers being near it but I didnt see any all I saw was a man overdosing on drugs
29736,4,Good 
19825,4,Good care and nice
26302,4,This McDonalds is conveniently close to Santa Monica Pier about 1 block away I love buying food from here and eating it by the shoreline with friends  Do note that workers can sometimes be very stingy or serious due to the large amount of people that come in daily this McDonalds in particular gets very packed So please be kind to them they are trying their best to get your food served 3
29341,4,Nice place
29735,4,Good 
32936,4,Decent speed okay food
19539,4,Very clean very good sandwich
32938,4,No issues good experience
29742,4,Good 
19812,4,I always get what I need for my home
26326,4,"The only reason I am giving this location for stars instead of 5 is because overall I dont eat McDonalds or fast food However the one day that I did go to Santa Monica I just had a sudden craving for something fatty and sugary

I went inside and dislocation surprisingly very clean The staff there were also very hospitable friendly and alert I ordered me some french fries and a sweet iced tea and then I proceeded to the outdoor Courtyard to eat

Out there was just as clean as it was on the inside I havent had McDonalds since 2012 so I was really surprised at how fresh the french fries and the sweet iced tea taste it

Everything was okay okay with me"
19848,4,I like ice cream
23230,4,Very modern McDonalds you have a kiosk where you can order and they brink your food to you They also have a nice pkayplace for kids which looked new and well thought out with touchscreen computers for older kids Very nice
25532,4,I had to get out of the rain and service was really quick
25535,4,The ice cream is the best But the Hamburgs are to small and the frys the make are the best as long as there Hot
19865,4,Good 
26340,4,"Very nice very clean
Saw a guy come in who looked homeless and 2 security guards immediately swarmed in and ushered him out It was kind of impressive yet I felt so sorry for the guy and thought security should have been more sensitive when doing the job because the man clearly wasnt all there

Also the mens rest room was very clean however Id prefer paper towels on hand in addition the the blowers I had to touch the press down facet button and I had to touch the soup dispenser I like to use paper towels to touch these things especially the door when leaving"
19862,4,Good 
19860,4,Good 
26335,4,There have been issues with some of the patrons getting out of hand with the staff but it seems that the issue has improved My family generally order through food delivery apps from this location to avoid unruly patrons They always get our order right and the delivery is seamless
32917,4,I had breakfast was good
29748,4,Good 
19857,4,Good 
29330,4,Typical McDonalds
29333,4,Fast service
26328,4,Always has an abundance of homeless population hanging out inside and outside Remove that you get 5 stars Felt dirty although they were constantly cleaning the restaurant Food is your typical McDonalds no change there They offer a bathroom but its a busy location Overall Id return with caution 
19851,4,Good place
32923,4,There was no Mc flurry
26298,4,To be honest I usually frequent this local Santa Monica Micky Ds for its coffee I have to wake up pretty early so a nice jolt of caffeine helps me start the day at 5am With that being said I will also say that because of Santa Monicas influx of homelessness over the years this particular location gets alot of homeless patrons Most are nice and I buy some of the regulars a thing or two from time to time however its the aggressive homeless patrons that make the place feel troublesome The staff tries to placate situations but you can tell they are getting frustrated more and more everyday So if you cant handle talk be patient and react positively to people who are just trying to get through the day the dont go here I dont need you screaming and being annoyed at every little thing Bye
29734,4,Good 
26290,4,Lots of homeless people inside
32966,4,Finally this place is cleaned up
26269,4,It is just minutes away from the pier many homeless people inside and you should take good care of your belongings It is clean but employees barely smile and cold due to holiday working hours I guess  Had the double burger cheese and oats meal which I do not complain It is thanks giving holiday
26264,4,I dont eat at McDonalds but I do UberEats deliveries I love this McDonalds because it has a parking structure in an area that typically doesnt have one This makes it very convenient for me and people who choose to eat there
29728,4,Good 
29725,4,Good 
26255,4,Stopped in for a quick visit at this newly built location Nice bright dining room with fresh flowers on the tables The usual self ordering screens or a helpful staff behind the counter waiting to take your order If you are in need of

32961,4,Good fast and clean
26272,4,The Santa Monica location is on par with most McDonalds out there The food was satisfactory and the speed of service was reasonable My only problems with the experience were the restaurant was incredibly busy and the smell of pot was pretty strong from someone smoking it out on the patio They had the munchies I guess
26274,4,Its McDonalds 
26275,4,Look the staff here is great despite the unwanted obvious nuisance Food is prepped fast and staff are professional Restroom are actually kept clean again despite certain unfortunate citizens I always take out from here and go to the beach Or park my car at the very top of the lot and eat there
26289,4,Its not clean and there are no offers but still ok Bathroom is usually clean

26282,4,"It has been a mighty long time since I need ed to concern myself with dining in at McDonalds
Since Covid19 the option to dine in was removed Remarkable"
22861,4,Its McDonalds You know what youre getting You know that every once in awhile and order is going to be messed up but if you walk in theyre going to fix it for you and probably throw in a free French fry Theres no reason to give these service workers a hard time theyre doing what they can Thanks guys Everyone once in awhile I want some chicken nuggies and and its always you guys and your sweet and sour love sauce Hot mustard is acceptable sometimes
32955,4,Long wait Few employees
26280,4,Its a McDs fast food cause you dont have a lot of time when youre going somewhere Convenient place to grad a quick breakfast in the morning with all other shops still closed
32956,4,Okok Clean restrooms
26276,4,Its McDonaldsby the pier  McDonalds In the wee hours only time I go it can be colorful with the occasional altercationconflict but they have security  Never had a issue there  Order my food from the kiosk wait pu eat while I walk home and later wish that I didnt order 3 to 4 sandwiches

22826,4,Typical McDonalds but extremely long waits due to proximity to tourist attractions  Be prepared to wait 20 mins in the drive thru even for a mobile order
25520,4,I only eat breakfast here now but when I get my hot caramel its a hit or miss Sometimes its perfect days taste like dirty water but they will correct it
23242,4,Can get pretty busy but its right next to the holiday inn which is very convenient It
26376,4,Its McDonalds cheap sustenance to keep on going We had a couple burgers and fries and I cant complain they were alright when the price is taken into account It can be quite busy at times so keep this in mind when going at peak times The restaurant itself was pretty clean what you come to expect from a McDonalds
32896,4,Not bad
19955,4,Good 
19954,4,Good 
19952,4,Good 
26375,4,The service is fast but since the pandemic it seems that the mask is the most important thing security is polite and the Cusomer service associates are kinda formal but still politeyou can eat on the patio but not for long

23245,4,The service was good put their is now fish fella

26352,4,No different than any other McDonalds except that its in Santa Monica very close to the pier and beach Its surprisingly well kept and clean and very fast Lots of tourists and visitors and the location is updated with the order kiosk systems so can get moving pretty fast Seating can be an issue on very crowded days Over all good experience and not too bad
26347,4,Convenient location and although there are some challenges the area faces homeless and everything that goes with that the restaurant does a good job keeping things clean service helpful and food good as always We had an order with a lot of custom requests for kids no this extra that and each burger was put together exactly as ordered

26364,4,We ate breakfast here every morning while staying at a hotel around the corner The food was always made correct and fresh however the large amount of homeless people hanging out make things a little more difficult  No condiments are self serve  the security guard has to let you into the bathroom sometimes hard to find a table
26362,4,They accidentally gave my friends and I a whole order that we cancelled and they also gave us the actual orders we bought All in all they were pretty fast workers They have to be because that place is always packed because of the Santa Monica Pier I understand that its not always going to be clean there because frankly theres not much room to clean there most of the time If I could give 42 stars I would
26360,4,They always have a lot of staff in hand specially on the week ends and at peak hours You will always see a lot of tourist due to the perfect location near the shopping and the pier This also means that there will be homeless there as well I like to live and let live so I dont mind sharing space with my fellow man With that said there is security at hand at all times Even when this place looks crowded the service is fast and like most McDonalds with a smile You get something to eat at a great price in a perfect location
29320,4,It was excellent
29756,4,Good 
19929,4,Good 
26365,4,I just had a large fry it was okay the kids had hamburger happy meals the burgers were cold and tasted funny they ate the fries and of course really liked the toy inside 7 out of 10 today mediocre
25096,4,The place is good Accessible and fast service
32188,4,Yup
25095,4,The food was excellent but the fries were ugly
27986,4,Just stopped by my local McDonalds to pick up some breakfast items before going to work The 78th Street Tampa Florida branch is always on their mark quick efficient usually correct with my order of hot tasty food I cant believe how much Ive been eating at McDonalds the last 3 years after many many years of barely ever going there since I was a teenager in the 1970s Food is definitely better than it used to be and I love getting deals with their online phone app and food questionnaires for freebies from the receipts
31457,4,Very good pretty punctual theres some issue with the ordering ordering screen and the timing of all of that
21603,4,Never changes if you dont know McDonalds you must be an alien
21602,4,First McDonalds ever to be able to say Excellent Service
30707,4,Clean fast and friendly service The food well its McDonalds so its the same as any other McDonald no surprise 
31462,4,Noise of animals is scary There should be warnings aside from the cheetah print booth seat decal Beware
22303,4,"The biggest seller to me is that it is open 24 hours a day  It helps to have somewhere to go eat when your biological clock is ahead of the local time and you wake up hungry  The food was hot  The drink was cold  Service was great

During my visit there were two vagrants got into an argument by the main entrance  One parked his belongings and entered while the second one exited and began to rifle thru them  A few cuss words and flung arms in gesturing and the situation calmed down  The staff observed for an outcome prior to engaging so I am going to assume that this has occurred before and they got the handle on it"
31467,4,Good place to eat at if youre on the go I like the sausage  biscuit weggand its good
31468,4,Fresh food been around forever staff seems to have become better under new management A goodbad location but over good place to eat
24449,4,No heavy traffic which means your food is made fresh and rarely sitting for too long Would recommend over McDonalds entertainment location further up international drive where the prices are significantly higher
31471,4,Its what you would think  Staff was friendly and quick service
21595,4,Enjoy their iced coffee
30700,4,No in or outdoor seating yet  Drive thru or inside pick up of food only at this time
24451,4,Middle of the day and they were fast efficient and friendly the fries were hot everything was fresh
22308,4,Location packed due to being within waikiki as a result of this it is recommended to order ahead via the app Line can take 10minutes or more And can be stressful Burger packs offered
31454,4,Keke is the best i appreciate her great service kindness n patience Young lady with a great future ahead Thanks KEKE
27987,4,The food is always on the meh side Luke warm never hot and fresh even when its busy and the employees are typically miserable
23837,4,I always like coming to this McDonalds its always clean the staff is always friendly and they were pretty quickly
27988,4,New interior looks great This location has the new digital ordering computers The food came quickly and the staff were helpful Only downside was that one of the card readers was broken and it wasnt marked
21636,4,Late night food runstates that they are open 24 hours
30718,4,Ordered from kiosk Food brought out to table Good customer service
23844,4,I can never stop eating cheese burger Love this place
21635,4,The drive through was very slow
23843,4,Food is great time to make your self conscious choice for a good deal
21631,4,Good McDonalds but quite busy
21630,4,Bad service but consistent quality in food
31474,4,Very good customer service near the Dallas zoo very pretty theme of animals
28003,4,This is one of the busiest McDonalds I have ever seen Very modern inside Most people were getting food to go so there was plenty of room to sit but so many people waiting for food At least it was very fresh
27996,4,It can get tight getting inside when theres a delivery truck next to the store Most especially when youre going towards the drivethru 
31435,4,A Mickey Ds outside of the zoo Brilliant And then to have it zoo themed  perfect other than the shake sound scaring me while I ate
27992,4,Excellent location with a large playground and plenty of seating for adults The food is your typical McDonalds fare with nothing special to write about They have a large parking lot and the bathrooms were clean during my visit My only recommendation would be for the managers and employees to meet up behind the restaurant or in the break room instead of right in front of one of the main doors of the restaurant It made the place look like a corner store and cheapens the image of this brand Their service was top notch and although they were packed during this visit the food came out fresh and without any delays
24435,4,I dont normally review McDonalds but this is a good one because of the staff right now  You know what the food is like so no need to discuss you either like it or you dont  There is a very sweet older lady that works here that is phenominal  She likes her job is nice to customers and actually makes this place great  I will be back  Thi
22299,4,Stopped in for a quick  bite to eat I couldnt get  breakfest  because  they said they stop serving  breakfest at 1100 am And  so I enjoyed  a Big Mac with my morning  cup of coffee  and a ice water by the way its now 50cents for a cup of  water
31445,4,Good coffeethey didnt have the donut sticks I was craving for thats why I gave them 4 stars
24437,4,Very busy usually fresh hot food fried typically dont have salt on them have been multiple times before with the same issue Prices also higher than other mcdonalds otherwise clean friendly employees fresh food
21624,4,A standard McDonalds with all the junky food you can eat Free wifi
28452,4,Not very well lit drivethru but the customer service was great
31477,4,The shrip and salmon tacos was absolutely tasted Great flavor
23831,4,Very polite at the drive thru and order is always correct
27939,4,We came here twice during our visit to the area The first day I would have given them 5 stars the service was fantastic and despite being extremely busy they gave great attention to each guest The second time however we came through the drive through and the service was terrible It was very early in the morning there were only a few other cars in line maybe 3 in front of us and we were in line for at least 15 minutes
27936,4,"Friendly staff always busy but food done in a good time and always hot Restaurant kept very clean Plenty of parking
A good McDonalds to be fair"
21552,4,Hit and miss there was a lovely member of staff with braces who was super helpful
21550,4,Its cool except the waiting for the key to the bathroom part
27933,4,Excellent and fresh hot food  The inside is spacious and clean Friendly staff but I dont like the system where you have to order by yourself with the large touch pad makes it hard to customize your order and confusing  Id rather just wait in line and have the attendants take my order like most McDonalds  But at this McDonalds you must order at the touch pad by yourself
31506,4,Its line is usually long but thats normal Good spot if u want to grub on mcdz
27932,4,Pretty decent but the machines you go to for ordering was usually broken Im pretty sure the ice cream machine was broken at one point because we couldnt order any ice cream related products All along it was a decent experience and I would probably go back again if Im ever in the area again
21543,4,Good food and price but 5 flies are flying around your food
22317,4,Cheapest place to eat at the Ocean front  I would grab a sandwich and fries walk across the street and watch the sun set they have benches You cant sit inside with Covid but why would you is you can have a view of the ocean while eating
21542,4,Always great food for when on the road or for a healthy quick meal
27921,4,I eat here once in a while when Im in a rush or just need a good fish sandwich Always good and fresh never any issues with the drive though which 99 times out of 100 is what I use Good place for fast food Drive through attendants are always quick and polite
21540,4,Service was quick but it seemed like the person taking my order was distracted
21537,4,Considering the small location  the staff delivered prompt and courteous service
31510,4,FASTEST SERVICE OF THE McDONALSs LOCATION I DO NOT EAT HERE BT THE SERVICE FOR UBER EATZ WAS GREAT STAFF WAS NICE
21534,4,Its clean for starters Other than that just regular McDonalds no dollar menu though
30684,4,I went during Hurricane Irma when there were not that many places to go and get food yet McDonalds was able to serve fresh hot food I recommend going to this one
31496,4,Lines are long but thats to be expexted Frys were good and hot
30685,4,Had a mac attack was good hot off grill per my request Fries were not hot
27946,4,Employee was rude but it fine 
22310,4,Where else are you going to go to have a cheap breakfast

30697,4,For such a busy establishment  I got my food quickly and order was accurate
23828,4,Very good lunch was hot and nice just the way I like it
27963,4,Normally I would give this restaurant five stars but today service was really slow I placed an order for two Egg McMuffins  a large french vanilla coffee My wait time was approximately 10 minutes I also believe on this particular day the restaurant was understaffed Again usually this restaurant is a fivestar McDonalds just not on this day
31488,4,Service was good food was normal play place was great except the AC wasnt working
30693,4,Quick friendly and fresh food Great place for quick food
24453,4,"Only used thr drive through but order was correct and the food was good  Busy unit given its location but the flow through the two lanes was pretty swift

Interactions with staff were efficient and pleasant"
27961,4,Always a favorite McDs is still serving up all the favorites  we were there for breakfast and had a short wait Alas no dining room availability at this location for now Very reasonable prices of course and some delicious NEW breakfast pastries
28461,4,Service is nice and fast but sometimes the drivethru line can be a mess
27952,4,Kind of touch and go with this location Sometimes theyre very attentive and sometimes they dont listen when youre trying to give them your order Late night is when Ive generally had problems with their service Otherwise they are pretty good
31493,4,Yea I love your food so many varieties  like dollar menus
21566,4,The chicken sandwiches always taste great when I order here
30689,4,its mcdonald
24465,4,The friendliest mcdonalds staff I have ever met Tasha was the sweetest worker there The food was good and as isially good price They had some fancy new machines that had to be 2019 machines I was lost and couldnt get a refill cause it made me anxious and they were busy But overall good time okay food good people
23820,4,Its McDonalds 
21572,4,Hey i ordered 4 out 5 stars
28013,4,Great workers were very helpful Eating area play area were clean Mens bathroom was quite messy and the toilet paper holder was torn off the wall Overall will come again
24417,4,No wait in drive thru line They got the order right Fries were nice and hot and the staff was respectful I did not five stars because the girl at the drive thru struggled to understand me english was not her native language She tried though and it all worked out I got my correct order and in a timely manner
28021,4,Very clean and it taste as usual
31337,4,I had to get out of the rain and service was really quick
31340,4,The ice cream is the best But the Hamburgs are to small and the frys the make are the best as long as there Hot
23879,4,Burgers are good  Just check your bag before leaving the drive thru
28430,4,Great for a burger that taste the same around the world
28431,4,Food was good but you never get the sauces you order on the touch screens
30775,4,Like most any McDonalds pretty good service should be a little cleaner and in better repair for 5 stars
30774,4,Food was good  Staff a little slow  Free refills
21708,4,Great service and nice atmosphere
21706,4,Great place and cozy for children and parents
22272,4,Mostly the same as any other MDs fast eatin or Togo but remember its next to the beach so its a bit more sandy and humid
28055,4,The line for drive thru was out to the street Not their fault it is not the first time Once I got to pay point it was quick
22275,4,South end of shopping areas Can be a bit crazy with people being its location across the street from public beach
28053,4,Its a good place for fast food
22277,4,Located right on Waikiki Beach so its usually pretty busy But my experience has been that the service is usually quick and the food is good Best not to go after hours or late into the night so be warned about that
22279,4,Hawaii Beach front McDonalds yes please
30784,4,Betty was fantastic smiling and helping a hurricane worn parent with two active toddlers
28426,4,Had a long wait in drive thru but customer service was okay

28070,4,The place was clean the washroom stalls needs repairs and it was clean but smells like urine big time Staff are friendly and helpful Thanks Rick Stasiuk Wetaskiwin Alberta Canada T9A 3R2
30808,4,Has improved in recent years more like the original all beef mcdonalds now with custom burgers
31315,4,My 3yo granddaughter loved this place The play land is well designed with plenty of room for active exercise and the larger than life zoo animal motif delighted her
30803,4,Although there were a lot confusion on the front desk my order was served
28065,4,Food was good dont like self order screens
31320,4,No matter how many cars are in line they get you through pretty fast when I got to the window I wanted to get an extra order of fries and they told me they couldnt sell them to me
21695,4,Good prices for fast food in vegas
30795,4,Right across from where I was rooming Took 20 mins to make a egg mcmuffin Other food came out fast though
31325,4,I only eat breakfast here now but when I get my hot caramel its a hit or miss Sometimes its perfect days taste like dirty water but they will correct it
21726,4,Much better than paying Mandalay prices
30788,4,I
21721,4,Amazingly friendly and fast employees
22264,4,Great Pity about the homeless going through the outside bins for food So bad I brought a meal for one eating a discarded bit of pineapple
23884,4,Love there breakfast menu Who cant eat breakfast at any time of the fay Right
24355,4,Tgey forgot us at the curbside pickup 30 mins
23885,4,I cant remember so it must have been good
23867,4,Service was a bit slow food was good nothing wrong
23866,4,Drive thru times vary Faster to go inside during the evening rush

30746,4,Drive thru open late Ive never had any bad food here
22285,4,You know its McDonalds convenient and not pricy
30745,4,Unfortunately the game room was under maintenance when I went
22288,4,Great clean environment Mask or optional no wait in line they have kiosk where you can order food and they bring it to your table for you
30744,4,Big place lots of seating available Has self service screens to order and pay and an employee takes your order to your table when ready
31395,4,Service is needing improvement cars backed uP in drive thru 
24404,4,"Busy busy busy  Prepare for a wait

Location is good Restaurant is clean  Employees are nice Orders are accurate  Ordering Keosks are cool  Well laid out  up to date    but prepare to wait  This place is busy beyond repair  Drive through stacked at least 9 cars waiting with both wait stalls full  For the last hour 8 people lined up inside with 2 of the 4 kiosks in use  Prepare for minimum 30 minutes inside"
28448,4,Very busy but got our large order righthappy people
31398,4,The phone still taste good but the services gotten pretty slow I love all the inside playgrounds for the kids on these hot days
31399,4,Always quick to get you served  One of my favorites
24406,4,Food was decent Cashier had difficulties with card in drive thru saying machine was asking for pin Odd Large order but smoothies three quarters of way filled Filled but looked like ice and concentrate added They did remake it which turned out fine
28031,4,The ice cream machine was actually working at this store Drive thru speaker was hard to hear No wait and quick service
28029,4,"I frequent the drive thru here quite often and since their update the speed of service has increased

Even though I am trying  to eat healthier these days I just cant stay away from my all time favorite Egg McMuffin These ladies and gentleman are always fast and friendly  with a delicious sandwich"
30737,4,The food was good and the place altogether was well kept and clean
23852,4,Not as fresh as I would have liked it but it was good
24477,4,Totally not the staffs fault but there was only 1 person to take orders from the double drive thru There were also a few minor mistakes on our order but considering they barely had staff I expected it
31386,4,There is a new zoo animal added to the front can you guess what it isthe service was gr8 and not a long wait
31382,4,Would be slightly better if they paid more attention when you order Still pretty ok if you like the sounds of the zoo to follow you to lunch
24381,4,I personally havent had any issues with this location In the 2 years Ive lived close by there have been 2 times where the drive through was majorly backed up and something was clearly wrong But of maybe 100 trips in the last few years Ive had 95 good service and fresh food
21691,4,Good hot food and 
28051,4,Food was fine but line at drive thru was slow possibly because girl working window was more interested in texting then waiting on customers
31372,4,Son loved his happy meal this is the zoo McDonalds it is great it has fake animals and animal pictures everywhere
21689,4,Typical fast food joint Clean
23864,4,Fries were kind of cold but the wait was no so bad
28437,4,"All self service order
Table delivery though "
28439,4,waited in drive through for 25 minutes and left after that point went to go somewhere else
21687,4,This is a great McDonalds Always Fresh
21686,4,FYI no dollar menu or kiosk Very busy
21685,4,Its McDonalds It was clean and the service was fast
21682,4,Great service not packed at all
22283,4,Try their Hawaiian style breakfast you cant get in regular USA I came here when I was on the beach for their soft served ice cream 
24391,4,Good hot food  A bit of a wait for a McMuffin at 630am  Nobody else in line at the drive thru  They had to ask the chicken for more eggs
24394,4,We stopped at McDonalds just for drinks It seems they were low on ice and 
21675,4,Fast food classic the service is as it always is
30749,4,Used these restaurants for a fast grab and go breakfastfood was good
27915,4,The drive thru lane was fastWhen I got the meal it was fresh  and  taste it goodBut the only thing the orange juice was warm and the coffee they put their milk and sugar but it was no sweet enoughAlso they forgot to give us ketchup
30672,4,Very busy but clean  We ended up walking over from Hilton across the street
21531,4,Just at the drive thru but food was good and fast
21446,4,For a quick meal And to get out of the cold or heat It can be very crowded at certain times No WiFi
27746,4,"Update Megan is still here and amazing as ever She joyfully asked if she could get us refills YES They offer refills again Yay You just have to ask in case shes not there Fashima and two other gentlemen working were also very friendly and even offered to help carry my food to the table Almost like we were at a real sit down restaurant the way they took care of us Thank you The only thing was that the quarter pounder seemed small and was overcooked and dry But we will be back

Megan was very friendly and helpful with ordering If give her 5 stars we dont do refills here What So the funny thing is they are moving to have you order at the kiosk but you need to ask for the refills which they dont do because the beverage machine is shut down Just so you know when you go"
27739,4,There are two lanes of drive through I ordered on the mobile app while waiting in line  When I got to the speaker  they didnt bother to ask my order  or order number  They just kept taking people from the other line I know that sometimes happens  they forget the order cars pull up But not 4 in a row As they started taking the 5th car  I pulled into the line and went to the window  Food was OK when I got it  But waiting 30 minutes for that to happen in the drive through isnt cool
31664,4,The food is soo much bigger in Texas Gives you a bigger bang for your buck
21443,4,Standard for a McDs I didnt see any child booster seats or high chairs for the young ones but like other reviewer said you dont have to go into a casino where people are drinking and smoking a plus for me
28528,4,Very busy but food came out good  Lobby was packed
31668,4,Fast service and entire order was correct
30610,4,I had the salad there and it was quite nice The place was clean and the service was quite fast despite being full
31670,4,This place is okay they got my order wrong twice
27725,4,This is a pretty automated McDonalds Probably one of the most automated ones Ive come across Many of the customers went strait to the devices shown to enter their order and just stood near the pick up counter for their order I felt the process was still a bit slow given that the emphasis is for automation though Plus the area to stand was congested since it
30607,4,Hey its a McDonalds whattaya expect Has digital ordering kiosks  that actually work  so there is that In a neighborhood full of tourist traps some reliability is a plus
27722,4,Convenient to the east end of Kalakaua Ave Long line in the morning for breakfast Staff friendly and they canwill deliver to your tablewhich is the only reason I gave it 4 stars Complaints homeless person racked out at one of the 
27719,4,"Its McDonalds You know what youre gonna get Lobby was closed at the hour we went but there were seating options out by the beach so that was fine

Its nice to have somewhere cheap and quick to eat late at night because everything else that was open was sitdown and much pricier"
31674,4,So sad that its closed I would bring my grandkids here from time to time
27716,4,Limited menu here especially the breakfast items Food came out pretty fast though and was good
21447,4,Had a egg mcmuffin and coffee it was good
22389,4,Busy but not as busy as the other breakfast spots Great if you want a quick meal on the cheaper side
28524,4,Fast service not too much wait and usually there is always a space to sit
22387,4,They have outside seating beware of the pigeons and tourists staring and beggars right outside McDonalds But overall its McDonald We didnt wait too long to order food and it was packed with tourist which is cool because its in Waikiki They also have a kioskright word to order food if you dont want to wait in line Alot of seatings in McDees for groups or individuals No public bathroom though beach nearby though with lots of restrooms closed at night
30621,4,good service MUST REALLY OPEN THE INSIDE DINING the people walking the driveway is NOT Safe AVOID an accident
31638,4,Is a regular option of non expensive fast food in the area
27771,4,For a McDonalds I was pleased Ordered at a kiosk but they brought us our food to the table Order was correct and food arrived quickly Quite clean
30616,4,No complaints Pleased with fast customer service and order was correct
27769,4,"Very polite service Very clean One has the ability to self order Playhouse for the little ones

Thank you Ileanna for the great coroner service Keep up the great work"
21456,4,Its a McDonalds so you already know what to expect However while hotel food is wonderful this is a welcome break from the noise and prices when you need it
23718,4,Lines were long even at 7pm but food was hot at this location and they dont skim on the ice cream cones
27715,4,Breakfast specials are good The sausage burrito and sausage McMuffins with eggs are freshly cooked Been wanting to try their spam eggs and rice but during our visit their rice cooker isnt working so t
31644,4,Breakfast was fresh and the employees were friendly
31647,4,McDonalds is your kind of place they feed you rattlesnakes french fries up the nose yes McDonalds is my kind of place
21453,4,Generally good service but the last few times Ive had to pull ahead on the drive thru line and wait an unusually lengthy time
23716,4,For a McDonalds this place is good  The staff for the most part are friendly and helpful  The parking lot and drivethrough are well designed  I also like the fact that this location is open 24 hours
27762,4,"Clean place with prompt and accurate service The chicken nuggets were delicious and crunchy    We ordered through the Drive Thru with hardly any wait time  The attendant confirmed our order no less than twice and I was given exactly what we asked

The inside is clean as well as the bathrooms and has a lot of seating  Theres also an indoor play area for the kiddos  In this location you place your order on the touch screens in front of the cashiers"
21451,4,McDonalds is good place to eat but they might get some orders wrong but its still ok cause they have this thing where they are making food from all different McDonalds in different countries
22386,4,This McDs seemed to be shorthanded but worked hard to get it done We were told by an employee that eventually that McDs would be self order on those machines and all employees would work in kitchen  No counter ordering How sad and so impersonable We want people to talk to not machines
27760,4,Typical McDonalds but extremely long waits due to proximity to tourist attractions  Be prepared to wait 20 mins in the drive thru even for a mobile order
24552,4,I dont like self order machines
30598,4,Mickey Ds is always the same so it kind of depends on the restaurant site and this one was a little dirty but the food was good
21434,4,Longer wait time in drive thru But good service
28530,4,Good place for fast food 
31726,4,Staff is fairly friendly and the service is quick
28559,4,Good service got my order right the first time
30579,4,All I had was fries this one time and they were hot and fresh oh and also there sprite is to die for
31729,4,It is brand new  the staff is so nice
30576,4,It was a great McDonalds We used it as a meeting spot before We used it to change clothes after the storm It was just a great place to meet eat and greet
31731,4,Dont like it but its food I guess lol
27647,4,Ive been here many times and theyve never messed up my order which is a better track record than most McDs Ive frequented Above average for a McDs but they should work on keeping the fries fresher often old stale and gross Few things better than fresh McD fries and few things worse than old ones
21410,4,Wish my food would have been a lil hotter and a lil more fresh but hey thats fast food for ya
22426,4,Good spot for McDonalds
23677,4,I take advantage of the buy one get one breakfast sandwiches Definitely worth saving your receipts
24591,4,Long lines here since its in a tourist area but the service was friendly and the food was hot Just be prepared to wait in line for a while
30570,4,Very busy place  big place the place was clean 10 plus
22432,4,This is quasiAmerican BBQ  Its still good though  The restaurant is very clean and modern and the staff is very professional and friendly
23676,4,In the morning this McDs is so fast so friendly and always gets the order right They dont add something I didnt ask for The hash browns are always crisp and hot  When I say light ice they comply  Thanks morning crew

31564,4,Good This time there was no wait for just a large chocolate
27876,4,"This McDonalds usually ROCKS
They can get thru a line that goes all the way to the highway in under 20 min

Tonight  there was no line Also the inside was closed AND  THE ICE CREAM MACHINE WAS BROKENSHUT OFF SHOCKER

My son did something amazing at school and wanted a Sunday for a treat So thats why we went

Then they didnt put all the things we ordered in the bag and we drove off 2 u turns in traffic and waiting in line now to get what they forgot
So I asked the manager if they could just add a small bag of fries since we had to do 2 uturns to get this item they forgot to put in the bag She said No we cant do that
REALLY I have worked in the food industry for 28 years  I am well aware of what you can and can not do
You didnt WANT TO You didnt want to value me as a person a customer  or a future You didnt want to do your job properly in the 1st place You didnt want to apologize in any way shape or form

I dont mind that a mistake was made I do mind that they acted like it was my fault for ordering anything to begin with

There are 22 other fast food locations in the quarter mile radius"
28481,4,To the girl that said she liked my tat Wassup You could make this a 5
22354,4,Late night meal choice was ok Tried the new chicken sandwich was really good You could only do take out
21477,4,Understaffed but friendly 16min ticket time
21475,4,Definitely not as bad as all those low raters are saying If they feel that way why would they keep coming back
22355,4,Kind of a bummer that they still dont have dine in available But it helps that its right across from the beach so you can walk there and eat by the ocean

31603,4,This location has a very nice Zoo Theme kids love it
28497,4,Good food at great prices Fast and friendly service
22351,4,Place was crowded but we got a table to sit at without any problems The only downside was that the machines where you could self order at the kiosk were all down
28498,4,Can form a pretty long line at the DriveThru as its a popular location but always polite
27815,4,As a McDonalds goes it was great Fries where hot burger fresh and the pies where hot My only complaint is that the opinions where very limited
31605,4,Love to spend time here with my daughter  We felt like kids again
31623,4,Not bad for a McDonalds Zoo animal themed Very busy for size
27794,4,Its McDonalds You know what youre getting You know that every once in awhile and order is going to be messed up but if you walk in theyre going to fix it for you and probably throw in a free French fry Theres no reason to give these service workers a hard time theyre doing what they can Thanks guys Everyone once in awhile I want some chicken nuggies and and its always you guys and your sweet and sour love sauce Hot mustard is acceptable sometimes

22341,4,"New kiosk to order from instead of standing in a line to order is a fantastic idea
Accuracy of orders picked up is a whole different issue Constantly having to ensure all food ordered are in fact in the bag is quite annoying"

22342,4,Fast service and completion of order pleasant staffall female nice location next to the beach Some homeless people in there with their belongings on the tables at far back Mostly keeping to themselves

24596,4,It was a little pricey Just like eating in a real restaurant 50 for a family of 4 But Im sure it cheaper if you get normal meau things We got noodles and pizza It was plenty of food for the price
24346,4,My family and i had come to Orlando for the weekend only so since Sunday morning we were ti head back to Miami We wanted ti get ahead of the traffic so we decided that we would order breakfast and eat as we traveled and McDonalds was our spot The lines were long but it moved pretty fast and we were happy I dont get ti eat breakfast out very often so this was a treat for me ad the food was great

22171,4,I went here for my morning pina and I found it pretty delightful The creaminess was slightly thinner than I was hoping and there was a palatable butternut squash undertone that was confusing my palette Nevertheless not bad for franchise pina I ended up going to the Laylow a few blocks away and ordered 19 coladas who were quite accommodating as we rolled dice in the corner
24169,4,Tried ordering at the drive thru but the manager that was helping the drive thru operator apparently is unaware of the current bogo 1 promotion told me I had to order 2 to get the promotion  so had to go inside and order thru the totens to be able to place my order including the promotion Besides that all clean food was good and service inside was outstanding

31230,4,This is an American classic serving up hot and fresh fast food favorites I like this location because the people are always nice and the service is always fast This is really good if you have a short lunch break and need to make the most of your time
31232,4,Ive been going there for many years as they are close to where I live They are consistently decent They usually get it right its normally fairly freshit is McDonalds so They do make a darned good cup of coffee which is what brings me back usually I generally think of coffee when I think of Mickey Ds
21795,4,Nice spicy chicken sandwich
23914,4,Although doing construction  at drive thru wait time was not long
28155,4,Service was fast but quality of food was disappointing on both trips
23913,4,The food was just as expected The place was clean and friendly Ill be going back
21829,4,They had what we needed
22234,4,Convenient to the east end of Kalakaua Ave Long line in the morning for breakfast Staff friendly and they canwill deliver to your tablewhich is the only reason I gave it 4 stars Complaints homeless person racked out at one of the tables some tables smelled  my 4yrold granddaughter asked me if we could move Nonetheless that was just one area so if you gotta go to McDonalds while visiting this end of Waikiki its a good choice Pickys Tip there are self serve kiosks up near counter So if in long line check them outfor some reason people were not using them Saved at least 15 minutes and thats how you get table delivery
21826,4,Clean spacious friendly staff
28146,4,Nice food and nice play place
28405,4,Breakfast was good as usual  quick clean and courteous Manager came by and grabbed my tray to top it off
30860,4,Very nice place with screen electronic order and table serving option
21793,4,Fast ear
31247,4,This is a wonderful wildlife themed location right next to the Dallas Zoo and perfect for bringing children for lunch before heading off to the zoo The staff is always friendly here the management is good and the restaurant is much cleaner and well run than most McDonalds in the area Prices are typical of the food chain service is fast and the food is usually above average for fast food Cant go wrong here especially with the kids They will love it
22237,4,Pretty long wait but consistent good food
21763,4,"McDonalds is McDonalds
Its always good"
28091,4,"Read down place has changed a lot Getting to be excellent place to go

Not good new construction is nice But understaffed Even at 23am you can walk in and find over half of the tables covered with trays and garbage Also the floors heavily littered Yes you are supposed to buss your own table at a fast food restaurant but alot of foreigndomestic vacationers are just filthy They just drop food and wrappers everywhere When they are done eating they just get up and leave
Hostbusser is needed for the dining area for the sloppy pigs More register coverage for the guests When a crowd of people have to go through one register while the kitchen staff waits for orders is inefficient
I have had 23 errors in my 8 visits First one was when they put extra mustard on burger instead of adding mayo Second was they ran out of hot fudge and instead of telling me they used the coffee chocolate topping for my Sundays yes 2 of them
I caught the first error quickly and was easily fixed properly by management before I left The 2nd error wasnt caught till we where eating the Sundays at home I took one back as proof of the error to get a refund At first they only wanted to refund one but with several minutes of bickering they refunded both Yeah it was only 1 and some change but it was the principal
I walk to and from the restaurant since I have no car it is about one mile away from my home I always request 2 plastic bags for my food because the one paper bag they put my 68 burgers fails halfway home The 2nd one is for the 3 Sundays

Another epic failure ordered 2 mcdouble no mustard and onions 2 bacon mcdouble  and 2 mcdouble regular Received the 2 mcdouble womustard and onions no problem 2 bacon mcdouble had no bacon and no mustard fail 2 regular mcdouble had no mustard either fail 2 large fries ordered and received 2 medium sized fries and 2 of the smallest sized fries Ive ever seen guess they where kids sized fail The 20 peice fry came without incident Less than 12 of the whole order came correctly
716
Getting better and better the manager Monique she runs a tight ship Every time Im in and she is there every thing is smooth sailing A great thank you for your great service Monique
718
Wow place was packed Was able to wait just a short time and got my order Looked around and yep there she was Monique steadily coordinating the staff Must of been 30 people in line only 5 min wait Later I saw her again in the lobby assisting a guest with her drinks both with smiles on"
22246,4,I eat here often Its always fairly crowded with tourists but the service is usually pretty fast There are no public restrooms but the dining area is kept clean
23898,4,My son and his vanilla milkshakes Good service and short wait
30816,4,Its a McDonalds what more can I say It is though clean with some nice modern furniture Nice to get a quick bite
30814,4,"Located on International Dr close to several hotels
Quick service the food is the usual Clean washrooms"
28083,4,We were visiting Orlando and I needed coffee Service was fast Staffs were friendly The sausage biscuit taste like freezer The coffee was good
30825,4,Stopped in for a quick snack when driving across the the state Quick and friendly service
23896,4,Drive thru wasnt too busy received my food within 5 min
31298,4,Busy place but the people who served us were friendly and polite More expensive than other McDonalds I visit I am guessing this is because it is near the Dallas Zoo
30809,4,Nice Ambience Clean not so healthy Good for Occasional quick bite
24340,4,Ordered two plain fish sandwiches with no cheese or  tartar sauce due to a dairy allergy When I got to the pick up window  they had put slices of cheese in both sandwiches I returned them and had to sit and wait for the order to be corrected  Unfortunately this happens constantly no matter what McDonalds I go too Its clear the prep team simply isnt paying attention to the instructions on the orders
21740,4,Good food great coffee
28074,4,This particular McDonalds across from Old Town is a hit or miss and I went to try the new chicken strips as an entre with my 4 chicken sandwich meal  Before I left the lot from the drive through I checked everything The strips needed more cook time my opinion so I brought them inside and made the request Now its McDonalds you should expect some kickback or something but to my surprise I was really shocked and amazed that the order lady took it told the MOD and he says he can take care of it he just needed about 5mins I told him no problem and waited Now when I did receive it he made sure he gave it to me and when I got home to my surprise added an extra strip 4 of 5 stars because the chicken sandwich was very delicious and the service blew me away but the strips I just didnt like
31303,4,Very unique McDonalds They have all sorts of animal statues around that make random noises while you eat The play place is unique and the outside of the place has so many cool photo opportunities The food is typical McDonalds
22252,4,Great location
23893,4,Good service and drive thru line always moves fast
31219,4,It would be nice if the play place was open again but its not so that was disappointing Its clean employees are nice got my order right
31274,4,I love going to this McDonalds by the Dallas Zoo cause they have these animals that make noise and look like a jungle in there Today we were there around 7pm and the cashier and the manager were so nice to us and they even talked to my kids and made sure that we got everything we asked for The only thing I didnt like was that for the happy meals for my kids they got the same toy and it was a girl toy I have a girl and a boy so my son got a girl toy I know why McDonalds do this but its not the employees fault
30826,4,Big breakfast excellent allways very 
31249,4,Very nice fancy CLEAN restrooms thats a plus Very clean lobby area and nice play area for children just no hooks on the restroom doors to hang our coat jacket or purse Overall its a well managed McDonalds compared to others I seen  A1 rating I also love the Dallas Zoo theme Its a tourist attraction Thank you McDonalds for your professionalism in management and customer service Please put restroom door hooks up for our coat jacket diaper bag andor purse thanks
21786,4,Love that special sauce Lol
21785,4,Its the same as all the others with remote ordering
22239,4,Typical McDonald
21781,4,Very cordial staff Thank you
24318,4,The place immaculate place your order at the kiosk pick up a number and it was brought to your table The attendant was very helpful and friendly
21778,4,Just what you expect friendly staff
31273,4,I liked it cause its right by the zoo and my daughter loves to play but the staff there can be a bit abrasive after a zoo event like the Halloween trick or treat event they we understaffed and ran out of a flavor of soda and large drinks and I payed for a large but only got a medium they should have just made the fries large but the guy running the register seemed kinda new
28122,4,Breakfast was good and the meals were delivered to the window accurately
31260,4,McDonalds is McDonalds Consistent menu food quality What sepates this location from others is decor and friendly staff that do a great job with order taking getting it out quickly and keeping area clean Besides the large play structure this location is an extension of the zoo experience with  models of a giraffe nibbling leaves from a tree containing a huge snake a  touchable cheetah statue and chatterbox chimp Great place to go with kids
28119,4,I love McDonalds  Been in my life all my life  No bigger disappointment than waiting for my meal and getting lukewarm fries  This one gave me lukewarm fries after I waited 15 minutes for my meal  I hold McDonalds to a very high standard and for me the fries make the meal  No exception
31266,4,Im guessing that this location is a training hub or something It seems like its always some kind of trouble when it comes to order food show code on app for food pay and go Sheesh 
21771,4,Just like every other McDonalds
21767,4,Fast service short walk from Mandalay Bay
28112,4,The line was long but they moved us right along all employees were friendly and courteous the food was fresh and hot I will definitely go back to this McDonalds again
30829,4,The double chezburger was great Hot and fast service Clean and busy place
30834,4,Was warm inside Eggs were weird Great service though
31310,4,Its the perfect place to finish a long day at the Dallas Zoo This animal themed McDonalds has a very large play ground area and plenty of tables and seats to watch the kids while they play The food and service was adequate although the bathroom could have been a a little cleaner All in all its different enough and the kids liked it enough that we will likely come back after our next visit to the Dallas Zoo
21845,4,Looks great but old
30865,4,Nice and clean friendly food somewhat hot Dont like self order kiosk
31157,4,Its McDonalds The place is remodelled Gone are the Zoo themed lifesized animal replicas on thee inside

23947,4,Management has been getting better

21923,4,Fine
28207,4,Great place to have a cup of coffee If you are on the keto diet McDonalds has whipped butter Yes its real butter Along with half and half You could ask for whipped cream Believe me there coffee tastes much better with butter  and cream in it   They do not have Stevia  They can make you a keto breakfast Which is eggs bacon and sausage layered

27454,4,Classic fast food with addictive french fries Burgers are prepared and cooked the same across the US Consistency and quality are worth each visit
24659,4,Biggest McDonalds in America with an extended menu arcade and play area  It is a Must go  just not now lol play area is currently closed due to COVID and arcade area needs a little tlc a little wipe down on dust

21326,4,"Standard McDonalds food except I notice they give half the bacon that other McDonalds Ive been to with hotcakes Its a convenient walk from Mandalay Bay when youre just tired of spending a ton of money and waiting in line for a mediocre breakfast at the hotel

The ice coffee is very weak so stick to hot coffee if you need the caffeine boost

The bathrooms are locked so youll have to ask for a key"
27484,4,Awesome vanilla cones
21322,4,"It was McDonalds You know what youre going there for and it is always quick and acceptable

If you are expecting a linen table cloth and candles you are in the wrong place If you are expecting quality food at a good price and rapidly  you found McDonalds"
28603,4,Took the grandchildren there they loved it a little slow though
21321,4,Priced for thr Strip The Manager needs to not yell at the employees in front of the customers Wow Nice ladies who work there Have some respect from management Went around 1130 am on Friday
27474,4,They have big macs  but no all day breakfast  mobile app works well though make sure you activate the order when u arrive IM HERE or no one will know what youre talking about
28604,4,The breakfast was GREAT Their pancakes superb
22505,4,They had the items we ordered bc other times like ice cream machine wasnt working  staff always friendly even though some customers can be rude
23649,4,Good service Area is bot the best  but they are open late Quick service and food is done in time  ppl are pretty nice
28607,4,Good service  and food is ok
22492,4,Place was packed out Standing room only The service was very responsive in spite of the huge crowd we received our food quickly
21311,4,Food  service and price was great  gave 4 stars because you have to go to the register and get a pin code to get in the restroom I didnt have time to wait in line to get the code Other then that everyone was very mice and great service
31855,4,The manager Sara is rude and unprofessional
22495,4,They forgot some things but the cashiers were amazing for the issue
21307,4,First time in a McDonalds in Las Vegas had to travel to the far south end of the strip Its nice despite it being more remote Stopped in on my way to the famous Las Vegas sign its clean good service despite it being Thanksgiving morning Its a good place to come before you get to the hairy crazy part of the Las Vegas strip
27464,4,Clean play area for children minimal staff but working hard I asked for veggie sandwhich because I am a vegitarian i said lettuce tomatoes cheese onion stuff like that but my sandwhich came out with pickles and cheese 0 they took it back put a tomatoe and 1 peace of lettuce on it I wish McDonalds had a nice big veggie sandwich to fill me up
27467,4,First time in a long time that I have been to McDonalds and the staff actually treated me like they appreciated my being a customer I took off 1 star because they were stingy with the mayo on my hamburger
21286,4,Great service One rude employee seemly didnt want to perform her job duties
28619,4,McDs always great with menu value updates but has trouble getting orders right SO ALWAYS CHECK BEFORE LEAVING
21280,4,Was on vacation and location was very convenient Over all nice and clean and great customer serviceOrdered the spicy ckn sandwiches4 to be exact and NOTHING like back home Overcooked with a pinch of sauce Burnt and dry as the desert Definitely wouldve said something if I was dining in I visited 2 more times before I left Didnt complain about ckn sandwiches and ordered different food it was just OK Must say they are stingy with sauce
31894,4,Its good
21252,4,For 6am the staff was pleasant the service was fast  I even used the self ordering kioskl Where its at there is no lack of homeless  panhandling so if you need the restroom an employee will let you in and dont be surprised if it is below standards or seeing someone sleeping at a booth On a brighter note The line at the drivethru window moves swiftly and there is a bus stop along the sidewalk for the North bound Las Vegas Strip bus
27399,4,This location has a fun indoor playroom area The play equipment always seems to be clean and wellmaintained I take my twoyearold granddaughter there occasionally and she always has fun The only reason for the four out of five stars is because their projection screeninteractive play mat has not worked properly since we have been visiting there over the last year It has partially worked on a couple of occasions and my granddaughter remembers that she enjoyed it Every time were there she stomps on it to try to make it work She will grab my hand and pull me over to the mat and try and get me to make it work I
24674,4,the food was good but the pineapple smoothie did not taste like pineapple smoothie  taste like ice only
21249,4,A very nice place You can feel at ease and enjoy quality time with your family and friends
27393,4,The directions to get here were a bit off Service was great Food wasn
22512,4,This McDonalds gets packed so be ready to wait a bit but its relatively clean considering how busy it gets If youre here be sure to try the McTeri burger
27408,4,We love coming here Tried the Shamrock Mcflurry and it was delicious
27378,4,Enjoyed watching our two boys play in play area
31901,4,Good and fast service
27373,4,Good service but one the staff in the kitchen is way too loud and wouldn
22514,4,really goodI needed some nuggetshot fresh and crispyfrench friessameyummysuch a treat
22515,4,Long lines but moved very fast
27368,4,Dine in area is fairly clean  they even have a nice sized playplace for the kids in a separate area from the main dining area Staff is nice  quick
31907,4,Good for fast food
21239,4,Lovely staff and amazingly quick service for my big order Impressive quality and great nuggets with sizzling hot fries The place is big enough and very clean However I noticed the pop machine wasnt working properly and spills cock around which needed a look Good experience overall
27375,4,Usually order ahead in the app and do curbside pickup Process is easy and discounts are nice through the app No issues with service or food quality at this location
21329,4,This McDonalds location is okay The food is always tastes great I like how they have WiFi here So I was able to eat and get my work done The staff here are nice I like this environment and commend this place
27409,4,Their employees needs to learn customer service
28632,4,Kid loves the playground Food is McDonalds what else Clean place
28620,4,Very nice place Very large play area for the children and clean atmosphere
27435,4,Its a pretty nice McDonalds Not highest quality of food of course cuz its fast food but I like the fries and getting deals Ive tried the mobile order a few times too and its cool how they bring it to you and feels like theres less wait
30515,4,Well organized I came at a busy time on Saturday morning used the ordering kiosk with a coupon to go and left in 10 minutes
31884,4,Nice and clean
22507,4,Food was hot and came out fast despite the fact it was packed and there were a lot of orders
30511,4,I went to McDonalds and the service was friendly and brisk We got our food and were amazed that after all these years the food is still awful and our bag was missing a sandwich The missing sandwich was the highlight of our meal
31886,4,Great sweet tea
24671,4,Crowded long waiting list
30510,4,New Cashier kid was pretty lost and messed up our order completely But the manager on duty was awesome and handled everything to make it right
31887,4,My express place going to work
21265,4,As McDonalds goes it was that However the food genuinely looked like the picture It was clearly made to order Wish I couldve used the restrooms I guess they didnt know that you can block off every other sink urinal stall or whatever It was the last free standing McDonalds with parking southbound from Vegas Bottom of Vegas Blvd
30507,4,Since this place has been remodeled it looks fabulous andI love the food My favorite is the McDonalds Mc series They are truly orginial foods Sometimes you may get a person who is rude and messes up your order but that rarely happens
28629,4,Very good food Just lines are to long
23636,4,Went through the drive through nothing to complain about But you can tell that the people who work there do not want to be there Too many fast food places in this area are like that though Maybe if they got paid a livable wage theyd be happier Maybe they deserve to be treated like human beings too Yeah I think so
31890,4,Good for quick food
21261,4,"All around the inside is Fair but need to check air vents its dirty All Soda Machine need to be constantly  watched because  when its busy it gets nasty and dirty  floor looks clean but need more cleaning and the windows all around need to be cleaned and of course the frame

Very Impressive One As far as the overall look

Managers and Staff need to be reminded and or trained that a Franchise who really depends on Customers to have more happy people to come to visit and eat here

Customer Service is Very Poor Your Cashier Staff or Front Staff is not following their training And why is it I walk in and I was stared by your staff and like they dont like to be friendly and all showing  how great and wonderful to have a job that lets you interact with people This is one of the most questioned part of Hiring Are a People Person Are good or happy to be around People ETC

The Outside Area is good  Actually better than good

Food is very good  but prepared Sloppy on my tray and the way it was wrap and coffee I have to dump some because they fill it to the top I mean they can save a lot of coffee expense and time making sure ask the customer if they want it fill to the top or not

So you have good location  ok dining area  staff not satisfied not customer service oriented plus the Manager is he or she really watching the staff and or helping to correct any discrepancies or problems

This is THE MC DONALD WHO GENERATE  a lot of the revenue because of its best quality fast food deals and environment and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE"
28627,4,Staff was nice usually always see someone cleaning at times it can be overcrowded
27350,4,Good
22483,4,Wow first McDonalds in a long time that I have fast service Good job team
27491,4,Ate inside  food was fine and order was correct    Overall was a good visit    Just wish was a little cleaner of a restaurant
27549,4,The time I was there very busy I ordered the a new cheese cake so I had to wait I didnt  have  to wait to long A associate brought it to the car
31782,4,Fast service and good food for on the go
23662,4,The first day the McRib came out I went inside purchased two of them to go to find out when I got home there was hardly too little barbecue sauce on it So the next day I went to talk to the manager she was very polite and apologized and made it up I replacing the two MC ribs that were fantastic so thank you for making it right bump bump bump
28580,4,Was just like McDonalds really Large portions are huge fries oversalted and coke tasted weird
23660,4,"My home Mcmunch always there to solve my cheeseburger deficiency 4361792
IYKYK"
28585,4,They have a nice offer a break fast sampler for 5 dollars
28588,4,Newly remodeled Self ordering kiosks so 1 less person to screw up the order
22464,4,Fast lines Breakfast was a bit different with serving rice with eggs
31793,4,they forgot my coffee on my order 
22465,4,A big shout out for their wifi Fast and consistent  Able to get some work done while having a good coffee and a biscuit breakfast sandwich
21366,4,We stayed at the Tropicana and didnt want to pay 2195 each for breakfast so we went here  It was a 10 minute walk  its across from Mandalay Bay and encountered 2 homeless men along the way but it was worth the walk  Food and service were excellent and the prices the same as other McDonalds   The place is new and clean   The is also a Subway in the strip mall   Highy recommend if you can stand the heat durind the walk
27524,4,This is a McDonalds so the food is normal and good I liked the service here and would come again
27522,4,Not a big fan of McDonalds but I do love their fries and cheeseburgers
31799,4,Ice cream machine work 60 of the time
21364,4,Same menu as every McDonalds everywhere and the quality is just fine The big advantage of this location is that its just off the strip so it has more normal prices and its not as crowded
23663,4,Wanted a quick bite so I picked up their 2 for 6 dollars mix and match items from their menu
28577,4,Great hot food and cold drinks
31780,4,Very unique McDonalds Themed for the near by zoo

23655,4,For fast food this McDonalds is better then average I think it is probably due to the staff There is a young girl named Carissa on the Am shift who is excellent She sees us come in the door and has started our coffee  we always stop on the way to work She runs around the restaurant  topping off your coffee  We always know when she is working the restaurant is neat and clean Thanks Carissa for starting our day off with a smile

27116,4,Trying to be helpful
28750,4,Went through the drive through nothing to complain about But you can tell that the people who work there do not want to be there Too many fast food places in this area are like that though Maybe if they got paid a livable wage theyd be happier Maybe they deserve to be treated like human beings too Yeah I think so

9568,4,Convenient right price good staff
13810,4,The service was very slow compared to Ireland and our order was mixed up even though we ordered on the self service machines The soft drinks were flat but otherwise no complaints  American McDonalds burgers taste quite different to Irish Mcdonalds
13812,4,Nice big McDonalds on the International Drive The place was packed and too noisy The service was fast though and had decent food Will try again for sure
4309,4,Meals and counter service have improved Open 24 hours to a diverse crowd of locals tourists and visitors
13818,4,It was cool definitely check it out
13825,4,Place is great for kids Usual McDonalds food but cost a lot more Better to go to a different McDonalds location to eat and Epic just got play and fun
4287,4,Have to wait for a while before I
4285,4,Its McDonalds If youve been to one youve practically been to them all Service was nice enough around breakfast time food quality can be hit or miss do they even care about Google reviews
13833,4,Great location very cool place to visit especially if you have kids Very cool that they have pizza and pasta Even omelets and waffles too Play area is the coolest part With arcade too Only down side was that the restroom  were fuking gross Mens restroom over all tho it was great 
4280,4,crispy spicy chicken sandwichcrispy spicy chicken sandwichcrispy spicy chicken sandwich is all i have to say you must stop in and get it and mix it with a hamburger and you will have whats called a mcgangbang you will be glad that you did so and will never get anything else please stop and get a milkshake and fries with a stop in there
4273,4,Restaurant is a ghost town and I am thankful for it lots of non paying customers normally around Food is fresh and staff is very efficient
4268,4,"Taylor was absolutely amazing to me
This was great experience after having bad ones at other locations Very happy Will come again"
13841,4,If youre looking for an atypical Mcds the This is it Housed in the heart of International Drive this world record holding burger joint holds its own Two stories of seating a GIANT play area for kids and even a little video game section You dont just get burgers and nuggies here they have stone fire pizza pasta and cake Its an experience for sure Just a heads up youll be paying a slight premium for the whole event Not much but youll notice Id suggest ordering on the app and getting a discount
13842,4,We went here for my sons 11th birthday and he loved it Dress for warm weather because up stairs where the play place is It
13844,4,Came here to florida for work purposes and brought the kids Food was goodoverpriced but good and came out quick We came around 930am on a sunday I was happy to see they have the bagel sandwiches back as texas doesnt have them yet My boys played on the playground and the arcade Half the games didnt work but would take money off the card anyways so we just played the ones that did work so we could get prizes and leave Crowded and loud but fun
4262,4,Not bad manager is rude to customers n employees food was good kid at register was very nice
13809,4,biggest in the world  but still a mcds the golden arches doesnt really do anything impressive  i mean disappointment is kinda expected  Walked in with no expectations  I like that they have other food besides the regular burgers was impressed by the brick oven pizzas they were putting together we tried ordering breakfast ALL DAY but they were out of so many entrees like OUT not sure how you run the worlds biggest McDs and not have stuff on hand at 230 in the afternoon It wasnt super crowded Love the selfordering kiosk thats what you get for demanding 15hr for fast food wages Love even more that you can order from your app and just go pick it up at the counter Our fries were as expected from the golden arches  the top floor has seating and an arcade  the main floor has a lot of seating areas with plenty of window seating for it being the worlds biggest it really didnt seem THAT big  also they could have more of a variety of entrees  foods  dishes that is different from a regular neighborhood mcds  just a thought
13801,4,So many unusual items  Got the pepperoni and mushroom pizza and the ham and cheese french toast  CRAZY  Really enjoyed the experience and would highly recommend everything stop here  The chocolate cake was pretty good too
4319,4,Good ice vanilla sugar free coffee
13789,4,Its a huge McDonalds and has a nice choice of other foods that are Not your basic options
4375,4,Nice place food is good quick service price is ok
13752,4,Did you know McD in Orlando has a Philly cheesesteak Yea they really dont its a big mac minus the sauce on a hoggie roll But good job trying new things
4367,4,I dont eat here but its clean and theres machines that you can preorder at
13760,4,Very average McDonalds experience overall Was cool because of the whole largest McDonalds bit but it was extremely hectic inside with kids running and screaming everywhere Took a while to even get the opportunity to order then food took a while to get to us which is understandable since it was so busy Ice was out in 34 soda machines Not a very clean place either Pizza was alright Very dry flavorless crust pretty soggy and could have used more time in the oven the oven could be hotter If they put like 20 more effort into the flavor of the pizza it would be a lot better Onion slivers were also just onion chunks Not a big deal just a little misleading But what else you expect from a McDonalds Food is a little pricier than the McDonalds Im used to as well Would probably have a better experience making the effort to dine elsewhere
4366,4,Good service can use the kiosk to order with credit cards
4365,4,Not much I can say its a McDonalds Customer service was good
13766,4,Biggest McDonalds in the world has special menu items pizza and pastas dont sleep on the ravioli bolognese Being its the worlds biggest it was a madhouse inside some kiosks down completely some just the payment part not working Overall food was good inside was a zoo but you can only get the special items inside
4261,4,It was my first time visiting this location it was nice It was clean staff was helpful I would visit again if in the area
13773,4,Was told that we had to come here because it is the biggest McDonalds in the country  It is huge there is an elevator that takes you up to a kids playplace and full size arcade  They also off menu items that arent on a normal McDonalds menu like build your own pasta and pizza
4340,4,Decent enough McD Service fast fries hot and fresh no trouble finding a table
13778,4,"Because it is the largest McDonald it is a place where you go there so you can scratch off your bucket list
It is very crowded  very noisy  a lot of kids of course
They have pizza coffee and sweets beside the regular menu

I think the staff works hard and as fast as they can In my opinion  the management has to step in big time in order for this place to run flawsly

The self order machines two or three didnt work  so it added to the slow service
Upstairs is an arcade game room You need coins It is very stuffy and even more noisy  But as I said a place to visit ones in a love time so you know you did it"
4326,4,It was decent sent a mobile order in and it was ready before I got there
4325,4,They prepped 130 nuggets for me in 10 minutesact of god or act of satanwho cares Excellent setvice
13785,4,This McDonalds has a huge amazing inside playground and arcade 2nd floor Beautiful fish tanks for the kids to look at while you are ordering It does get a little loud when the kids scream Plenty of tables for everyone Order downstairs and take a number  they bring it to you Super nice when you have difficulty walking g like I do However drinks are downstairs Handicapped parking in front of the doors An elevator to the second floor and handicap tables with half booths upstairs My neices love this McDonalds
4324,4,Ha I ordered a small fries got a large loved it  lol
13788,4,Kids had a great time Hard to find play areas these days Great selection of arcade games Our cheeseburgers were cold however i saw more customers opt for the pizza and philly cheesesteak
4352,4,Its McDonalds what more can I say Other than it gets really busy there though checkout wasnt too long Lots of shopping nearby
4376,4,Not usually crowded which I like The staff could smile more though
4258,4,Better service than usual manager moved my order along He wanted my order number to ease the wait
13856,4,"Pizza is from a Fire oven  turned out good
Philly Cheesesteak was also very good
AC upstairs was struggling was pretty hot when we went
Kids sweatted up a storm from playing at the play place which was also warm
We did not have any issues finding seating have tables for big groups on the 2nd level 8 of us"
4189,4,Very friendly staff looks clean  service is great
13903,4,Yo first time here This joint got a play area Im talking arcade style on the second joint 
4187,4,They had a very limited space but to make an agile experience they have two big touch screen menus to place your order faster than going to directly to the cashier line They only have one unisex restroom so if you are in a hurry be prepared mentally to wait Anyway I think youll enjoy your meal if you take in consideration these things
4183,4,"Mcdonalds food  is Mcdonalds food notting to it
I dont like the manager
But the location is very cool and the music gives you a good feeling
Again I just dont like the manager"
4179,4,The Big Mac wasnt fresh but service was fast   I would like to suggest everyone to download their McDonalds app They offer great deals  rewards points to receive free food 
13915,4,This location is huge for a McDonalds It has play area and arcade games It also offers customize pizza and pasta menu in addition to the usual offering Prices are slightly more compared to other locations which is justifiable given the amenities it offers I saw some reviews complained about slow or bad service I didnt notice that on my visit  Overall I think it worths a visit if u happen to be in the area
4163,4,The place seems very understaffed for the amount of traffic thats comes through this store so the registers are usually empty so order at the kiosk The food might take a bit also but it
13918,4,Food is okay just like another McDonalds but they have pizza service is okay but always busy building is amazing for kids with the playground and arcades
4151,4,Pretty busy and kind of dingy in lighting McDonalds Service is not as fast as you might like however the food is quite fresh
13921,4,surprisingly fast for such a large busy location After time at Disney it is nice to have a more affordable meal
4145,4,Its a good place to go and get a quick snack and drink 
4144,4,Standard run of the mill McDonalds We only had a coffee and a hot chocolate But no problems
13924,4,It was good but very crowded They have extended menu from regular Macdonald which I recommend to try
13926,4,This places was crazy busy Took 45 minutes to get our food The play area was  a fun experience
13927,4,Worlds biggest McDonalds it is really cool you should see this when youre in Orlando 2 stories tall ginormous playground and arcade and they have special menu items I got the brick oven pizza that was cooked in an actual Brick Oven it was actually pretty good and cheap but the service is very slow it took them 30 minutes just to give me my food
13894,4,Neat experience but dirty restaurant We did come around 11pm and they were very busy Husband did love the pizza
13893,4,A really fun experience  So many food options  It was easy to find veganfriendly food  The quality of food was about cafeteria quality but it still beat having to eat something considered regular food at this place  They have a large indoor play area an arcade fish tank a sundae kindof station  The kids loved it
4203,4,NEW MANAGER NEW VIBE great experience  The homeless shelter vibe is gone the place is clean the service is good Thanks for adding the security guard and the great new management Well that didnt last long The new manager apparently didnt last  Its still better than it was before though
4216,4,Absolutely functional You can order fast and sure when I went I was sure that It would take lot of time but that didnt happen the food was cooked in just a few minutes and it
4241,4,Its not a bad McDonalds by any stretch of the imagination but there are better in Manhattan  Its fairly clean theres plenty of seating the food was made well  There are none of those fancy new ordering kiosks and the bathrooms are dirty
13860,4,I lived in fl all my life and this McDonalds location is the biggest I have been 2 It has an upstairs  downstairs for seating Upstairs also has a game room I didnt order anything because the prices seem higher than normal That was understandable because its located in a tourist area I just amazed of how it look inside Seems like a great place 2 sit  eat with the family
4240,4,"Great service and extremely quickly served
Very friendly kind and professional staff
Will most certainly visit again
And yes the food in McDonalds is always satisfying An American Classic"
13868,4,"This was indeed a large McDonalds
The entire upstairs is an arcade and playground maybe
It comes with the problems you might expect in the worlds largest McDonalds
Still its the WORLDS largest McDonalds
The upstairs bathroom was real small still
I have been and you havent
The Big Breakfast with Hotcakes was excellent"
13871,4,Great time Never though i would eat a stake and egg breakfast in McDonalds It was a bit overcrowded for my liking Other than that Food was hot food was cooked to order Would go back again
4233,4,Best for quick breakfast
4228,4,This is a 247 location which is great The receipt printer was broken for a while which was annoying because they would still read off the order numbers as a method of calling people Also the layout is a bit odd It narrows significantly in the middle of the store making it hard to get through to the doors and the counter at busier times
13855,4,I went here with a lot of expectations so Im a little disappointed  However its pretty great place still This place is like a mini Chucky cheese married a McDonalds and its give birth to this biggest McDonalds  Its 2 floors with limited parking  They do have wood fired pizza  I wish I tried its  The pizza looked good  The staffs were super friendly  One McDonalds employee went around asking how everyone was doing
4224,4,Very quick service surprisingly easy to operate their self service kiosk Order was ready really fast I usually dont go to McDonalds but I was in a tight time crunch For a McDonalds restaurant it was not very busy I would definitely go back to this location if I needed to go to McDonalds in New York City Highly recommend stopping in to this location if you are in the area
13876,4,"Apparently it is the biggest McDonalds on Earth It is a 2 story building that offers specialty cakes pasta and custom built pizzas Also it has a huge indoor playground for kids as well as the arcade room

The Food
We tried pizza and surprisingly it was pretty good having in mind it came from the fast food chain Touch screen menu had enough options of ingredients to customize pizza order based on personal taste Keep in mind that some toppings cost extra I would rate pizza 78 points out of 10

The Ambience
This McDonalds is clearly a touristy family place which is good Also the service was pretty quick given the location"
4221,4,You can sit and eat inside The quality of the food is always on point during Breakfast and lunch hours I have yet to visit during dinner hours
13879,4,This is the first McDonalds I have went to that creates pasta and pizza Believe it or not it taste good Im super surprised my dish come out delicious However everything come with a price It is a bit expensive than every other McDonalds since one plate of customize pasta or coal customized pizza can cost from 1220 depending on what you want It is easily for 3 people to spend at least 60100 at this place I dont recommend their philly 
4217,4,Pretty cool one
13888,4,Large very busy McDs with a larger menu Food was a bit slow and it was hard to find a table Pizza was surprisingly good
13889,4,This is the Worlds largest McDonalds by square footage They have  play place arcade and unique menu items like pastas salads Belgian waffles a bistro menu and dessert options you cant find at any other location Dont fear because they still have the  fries  chicken nuggets and 
13891,4,So it is my birthday today and I wanted to try something I have never tried in my 47 years A McDonalds pizza or as they call it a McPizza there are only 3 McDonalds that serve them The Pizza and pasta were truly awesome We did the ordering from the kiosk and proceeded to our seat Everything was great except they didnt bring my husbands latte So I asked the gentleman that brought the food to bring the drink We were nearly done by the time we received it and it was incorrect After eating we went to get the correct one and the manager had an attitude and basically filled a small cup up with milk and handed it to us Overall the food was great The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because of the issue with the drink We will be back but next time we will get water
13875,4,Be prepared to spend 1013 per person Clean bathrooms also Staff is friendly and helpful with the ordering Upstairs is wild and crazy
4122,4,They got fast hands to make a sandwich from 5 Seconds no wait in this day over crying good food hamburgers taste like McDonalds
13749,4,Being local we try to stay away from the busy tourist places but this McDonalds is so big we really dont mind We like the fact they bring your food to your table and the employees try their best to keep this place clean The customers tend to be rude and push people or not say excuse me in this establishment
4379,4,Always a pleasant place to stop for lunch and take a break
4564,4,Clean fast service
13642,4,Really cool McDonalds with different menu items then most Had a cheese pizza blue Fanta slushie and a mcrib combo Pizza was actually pretty good Store is big but hectic and not the cleanest Service was super fast easy self checkout and brought to your table Young fella delivering table orders was hilarious and a great employee
4559,4,Clean and fast service
13646,4,"McDonalds tourist trap Yeah but worth it  McPizza was like a really good gas stationbowling alley pizza
The alfredo pasta over salty but otherwise no worse than frozen stoffers or big box store brands
The Pesto basil was actally not bad   not Bronx NY italian by any means but yeah gross
Playplace for the kids the video games are not bad same money drain as any arcade"
4555,4,Im Lovin it and the McNuggets
4552,4,Its McDonalds why are you reading reviews
4543,4,Just like any McDonalds in the world
13652,4,Was greeted with a welcoming fish tank as decor and friendly atmosphere from the staff although it seems like most things in the menu were sold out Food quality unfortunately did lack the food does look visually appetizing but lacks in taste and quality Would recommend stopping by if you want to experience something new
4537,4,Fast Accurate and usually Friendly
13656,4,"Youre paying for what youre receiving This is a crowded McDonalds Keep that in mind lines are long and the food is the same as any other McDonalds except for the specials here pasta pizza and desserts People are trying their best so dont expect a 5star restaurant treatment If you have time and a limited budget this will fulfill your curiosity
Ps Always check for deals they always have discounts"
4534,4,Friendly and fast service
4533,4,Nice for a quick dining
13658,4,"I think its the largest in the world 3 stories MASSIVE kids playground the serve pasta dishes on actual plates a real pizza oven scoop able ice cream parlor elevators as well
I think its a test kitchen type of thing Throngs of people Also automatic trash compactors"
4530,4,Good food
4527,4,Was pretty nice McDonalds A
13640,4,The play place is still shut down due to COVID but the kids still had a good time For some odd reason my son LOVES going to McDonalds even though we only go maybe twiceyear and only on road trips We had to stop here and he was thrilled We did the 530 min arcade card don
13637,4,This McDonalds is the biggest in the world Theres 3 levels to this McDonald
4569,4,They need more cashiers
4571,4,Quick service
13607,4,Kids love mickey ds so we had to stop by You order from a kiosk and wait for your number to be called Thought it was weird they didnt have the hot n spicy but it was pretty cool just to be there They do have pizza and pasta but we opted to stick to the originals we know Game room is small but again its all about the experience  Dont expect much and you wont be disappointed
4619,4,Too fat
13610,4,The Play Place and mini arcade on the second floor definitely make this place The food is actually brought out to you which is nice and there are some novel items on the menu but its still just McDonalds with higher prices Is definitely worth stopping at if you have child that likes the Play Places
4616,4,Ok customer service
4606,4,Its OK place
13618,4,Massive size diverse menu and captivating ambiance Arcade games play area and free WiFi add to the fun Minor wait times during peaks Highly recommended for MCDs enthusiasts The mcpizza and other menu items I have never seen before The prices are higher and there are many many people here Cool to visit and see
4594,4,my go to cheap lunch
13663,4,This Mcdonalds is  two story with a playplace Therr is also an arcade on the 2nd floor We used the kisk to order the food and and sat on the 2nd floor someone delivers Seems to be steady all the time
4593,4,You know what youre getting
13624,4,Playplace was large and 6 year old had fun Nowhere for disabled 13 year old to sit while brother played Nowhere to put drinks while playing without occupying eating tables Not enough tables for guests Long lines at kiosk Kiosk menu needs easier ways to find special items Many people asking for help Over a half hour looking for parking had to park at another business and walk over Needs more space Staff was all helpful manager was friendly Italian section interesting to watch restaurant was clean Nice experience only needs more space
4585,4,Not too crowded
13626,4,Clean Was surprised to see pasta and pizza as our local McDs does not have these items The arcade is upstairs you can take an elevator or the stairs It is really nice
4581,4,Clean restroom short wait
4576,4,Fresh food and clean
4574,4,Open 247 clean
13632,4,"Since Im known as Jimmy McRib I had to take the opportunity of visiting the worlds largest McDonalds even though it meant and extra hour and fifteen minute drive each way  Anyways this place is huge and legendary among fast food junkies like myself for the fact that they serve pizza and pasta  I would have been more impressed if they had the McRib too but it was not to be even at the worlds largest McDonalds

This was an incredibly busy place even at 930pm  There are tons of local hotels and tourists were everywhere with most of them speaking a language besides English  The restaurant wasnt the cleanest but that had to be due to the fact that they are open 247 and always busy  To my surprise the bathrooms were very clean and nice

Anyways what is unique at this McDonalds
 Hand dipped hard ice cream
 Multiple stories with an arcade and playland upstairs
 A pizza and pasta section
 A big fish tank in the lobby

It was difficult to get into the parking lot due to construction and traffic but there was plenty of parking  The one side of the building has a giant neon Ronald McDonald which was cool  I wanted to try the pizza or pasta but unfortunately I had eaten a nice dinner about an hour earlier and only had room for a hamburger which I ordered through the app  It was pretty hectic inside with tons of kiosks for ordering which was helpful since they had different language selections to match the language of those ordering  Some of my family got hand scooped ice cream but it was a nightmare as nobody was working that section and we had to wait ten minutes after waiting in the busy line at the counter to ask for somebody to help us  But they eventually got their hard ice cream and it was good

It was definitely neat to see this McDonalds but it was a bit too busy for me and the workers said that this was light traffic as compared to how busy it gets during the day"
13621,4,Arcade and play place on second floor was awesome This McDonalds offers pizza pasta and philly cheese steaks just to name a few Ordered from the regular menu however and fries were meh Warm but soggy There was a employee walking by asking if everything was ok which lead me to realize I didnt get juice for my happy meals which they retrieved
13748,4,"A fun place to go to maybe once or twice Went during the weekend The ordering kiosk lines were slow because people dont know how to use ordering kiosks McDonalds was out of pasta but they had pizza I was bummed because I wanted to try the pasta I ended up ordering a regular meal you can get at any McDonalds

Seating was easy to find and the tables were clean Employees were helpful The arcade upstairs seemed pretty cool and definitely unique We didnt play any games or play in the play place I enjoyed seeing Mac Tonight playing the piano Next time Ill get some dessert"
13664,4,Biggest McDonalds in the US Has an arcade and huge play place upstairs You can buy pizza pasta cakes etc here The kids loved it The staff was friendly Our order was right Even has an aquarium If youre hungry and want to see it its worth stopping
4512,4,Quick bitefast service
4418,4,Fairly clean and friendly staff music is too loud
4411,4,Yep thats a mcdonalds
4410,4,I has been a long time since I had McD I was good
4409,4,Good for late night bites near the train while around the NYU area
13714,4,This McDonalds has a pizza and pasta area made to order and is very good but like any McDonalds its hard to find the staff that are willing to work in such a busy and crazy place You cannot order with a real person inside You have to order from a kiosk and they dont always get your order right or forget something There is a drive through that is kind of like a race track and wraps around the building with 2 or 3 lanes and if your order is wrong oh well so be it Just take it or leave it There is a huge play place for kids and a second floor with an elevator
4400,4,The service was good the bathrooms are very dirty
4398,4,One of the nicer McDs Friendly staff and clean place to eat
13724,4,"Came on a Sunday afternoon on March break and I hated every minute of the experience

My family however had a pretty good time so I didnt bother to explain to them the downsides of mas"
4395,4,Your average McDonalds Short wait ok food fast service You get what you expect from McDonalds
13734,4,"Very big place i had to order from a kiosk but Im used to it and fine with it

I ordered three things came out to about 7 very decent i ate inside and in about 5 minutes a worker came to my table with my order

The customer service was very nice and upstairs they have a play place for the kids they also serve pizza pastas and cake here so it surprised me but overall great experience I will say because of the play place there is naturally a lot of parents bringing their kids so it can be very loud"
13736,4,Largest Mcdonald at the word they said very good beside regular manu they have pasta pizza and steak sandwichs on subs also big arcade on the secound floor went for dinner place was really busy thats the reason i didnt take pictures from the inside
4387,4,Convenient with the kiosk to customize my order and pay wirelessly
4382,4,Service was quick food on the other hand was k
13741,4,Been here a couple of times kids love it finally tried the pasta it was surprisingly good
13744,4,"So i dont usually give fast food more than 3 stars but this place was comically huge
Giant arcade and large play area
There is even attempt to make like omelette and stuff  I even saw brick stoves like you would see pizza cooked in Did I mention a fish tank

It did take a while to get our food and it was typical McDonald"
4419,4,Fresh hot food all of the times that Ive been there

13678,4,Fun to try McPizza and McPasta Food was better than expected Of course the ice cream machine was down The place is huge
4480,4,Well they messed up my order 2
4513,4,Even had built in wireless charging
4479,4,They got out all the drug addict from the stite
4474,4,Pretty typical NY McDonalds from my experience
4473,4,Very large lots of space to sit
13686,4,"This McDonalds is really nice Super big and offers other foods other then McDonalds lol It also has a second floor with more seating and a arcade section for fun They offer a tap menu option and table service So once your done ordering thru the self tap options you grab a number and have a seat

We ordered our regular McDonalds food with the addition of a strawberry and banana waffle Which was bomb

I did feel like the store was a bit dirty But it was probably cause it had a rush After we left it calmed down and the employees were cleaning

It is on the more expensive side We ordered two Mcdoubles which we had a coupon and applied it large fries a small drink and the waffle The total was 19 bucks It would have been 23 Lol"
4450,4,I like to order here whenever I want to add more layer of flab
4446,4,Billions and billions served here I like the self kiosks to order food
4445,4,Its alright At night it can be peaceful
4441,4,Had gone at 2am staff could be better
4478,4,Good food clean quick service
4626,4,Good for a McDonalds
4119,4,Probably the cleanest McDonald in the city  Its partly due to the posted security at the front door to prevent transient homelessness to take over  Also the competent day and night managers who motivated the food preparation team to perform optimally  This place should be the exemplary MacDonald store that all the other macDonald stores in the city should learn from
13932,4,The kids had a blast Very hectic and tons of folks are there You order at a kiosk and then they bring your food to you Our food arrived in an orderly time Although the fries were cold and we had to send them back The kids enjoyed the play area and game area I recommend you let your kids wear socks or bring some Otherwise they run around the nasty floor barefooted when they are on the playground They also have an icecream and dessert area
14268,4,Ordered the homestyle chicken sandwich fries and a strawberry banana shake It was hot and fresh and good for McDonalds
14270,4,"Love McDonalds

13985,4,We have always visited this branch when we are in Orlando As always food prices in this particular location is very expensive You can not get the morning deal of 239 compared to other location in South FL It is 379 for chicken biscuit and if you want to add a hasbrown it becomes  679 and since you like to add a drink you have to add 060 for a sweet tea Small size hot coffee is 199 Still a wonderful experience since they had the place renovated We experienced our first kiosk ordering here when it was first introduced
13991,4,If youre ever visiting Orlando why not go to the biggest McDonalds in the world It is definitely really fun The pastas and pizzas were surprising
13994,4,"This is obviously the coolest mcdonalds Ive been to An arcade little bakery pizza pasta and a cheesesteak Plus all the mcdonalds food you know of Im not giving it 5 stars because after waiting over 20 minutes and seeing others get their food and not have gotten my order yet I had to go up to the counter and ask for it But the cashier was nice gave me some extra nuggets for the wait and all was forgiven

I recomend checking this mcdonalds out at least once in your life Its definetly not like the one you are used to Plus open 247"
13995,4,One of the best maccys Ive seen We dont get them the same scale here in the UK  However during our visit on the middle floor there was female  drug addict camped out in the disabled restroom Who went into the ladies restroom and blocked a member of our party from leaving and asked her for money Fortuntely another member of the public went in and out party member returned   Other than that Really liked the place

4107,4,Good 
13939,4,We finally made it to the Biggest McDonalds It was a Thursday so it was busy but not packed Line moves quickly and they bring your food to you The play area was fun with lots of places to climb but our let down was the arcade The selection was ok and some were out of order Not to mention you dont really rack up too many tickets Over all it was fun food was fresh and its McDonalds so totally kid friendly
13942,4,It was a fun experience but our food was cold and our fries were not salty Id go again because I would like to try the pizza and pasta
4103,4,Good 
14010,4,"Nice organization overall clean enough The food took a while to come and my order needed a lot more salt than it had

13946,4,"This McDonalds is very impressive Its clean modern it has a brick pizza oven and fresh pasta options and a pretty decent arcade on the second level And they bring your food to you

Now I ordered a maple dijon bacon bistro burger and it arrived without bacon and Dijon sauce They brought it to me on the second floor and left before I noticed the error I was trying to figure out how I would grab all of my stuff and my kid who was excited about the play area go back downstairs get my order fixed and avoid a toddler meltdown when I noticed an employee cleaning up I asked him if he could get my order fixed even though I knew it wasnt his fault or problem and he did it happily He even gave my son a free cookie for the inconvenience AND waited for me to check my burger to make sure everything was right The customer service there was excellent The burger was still lackluster "
14168,4,Just too much in a little bitty area need bigger lines and some type of space I get in side a convince store but its still alright
4034,4,Good 
14018,4,Same mc McDonalds new experience They offer foods not on the menu at other McDonalds such as fruity pancakes and pizza The best part however is being able to order breakfast items all day It also features a second story with playplace and odd singing moon character that plays piano Parking however is hard to find even at the best of times
3997,4,Good 
3996,4,Good 
14094,4,Good food Pretty fast considering lunch rush I would give 5 stars had the manager not been to rude to myself other customers and employees not to mention his inability to pay attention to orders Perhaps he forgot that drinks are not in the lobby with the current health risks even though he had no problem shoving the lids and straws at me
3993,4,Good 
14111,4,Carmel Frappe should have it own line
3992,4,Good 
3987,4,Good 
14125,4,I always get mobile curbside pick up and usually they take less than 10 minutes for the order even if theres a long line in the drive thru
14129,4,They had a pretty long line for the drivethrough when I was there but they got through everyone pretty quickly
14133,4,Slowest McDonalds around But the games and modern layout make it easy to pass the time Particularly like the touch screen head to head games Play them with my daughter and we have a blast  Food delivered to the table for those eating in the restaurant Bathrooms are clean and there is easy access on and off the 35 for those traveling through and needing to grab a quick bite to eat
3982,4,Good

3977,4,Good 
3973,4,Good 
14153,4,Little slow getting order out but it was nice hot and fresh
14076,4,This location traditionally has fresher tasting food than other locations however they forget sauce for the nuggets pretty frequently
4002,4,Good 
14074,4,Food was good  price point for fast food is too high For two people 23  For quality and size of fast food meal I should have gone to cracker barrel
14073,4,They have started to give a full slice of cheese when you order one on FiletOFish sandwiches and that was a real problem before in which they used to give half of a slice extra This is a fast location and food is consistently fresh so now this location has the highest rating Ive given a fast food chain yet to date Kind of never thought Id give McDs a 4 star but I did
4032,4,Good

14031,4,Weve been here multiple times and always thru the drive thru Today we actually ate inside for lunch Today the food was pretty good Previously it was ok to good occasional messed up orders Regardless  we will continue to come back
14014,4,I visited this McDonalds only for the fame it has What makes it special is the new menu items pizza and spaghetti Also the arcade and the top floor is very nice My food didnt take long and the restaurant was very busy specially on Thanksgiving holiday 810
14036,4,Good McDonalds usually connect to a Travelwise gas station but due to covid its no longer connected Additionally there is no dining in You can only get food through the drivethru My drivethru order is always correct I usually have a special order of no pickles and its always correct
4018,4,Good 
14044,4,"I went through the drivethrough at this Mc Donalds and had no issue with ordering However it did take unusually longer to go through the Drive Thru

To that end the food was hot and fresh However they did overstuff the bags with my order As when I got one of the bags ripped and my food fell on the floor

Lastly if you go to this McDonalds be sure to double check if the bag is overfilled and ask for an additional bag if you need it Besides that everything else was fine"
14053,4,One of the slower McDonalds but attached to the gas station for convenienc
4010,4,Good 
4009,4,Good 
14059,4,Its McDonalds not a Michelin Star restaurant Service wasnt the best then again it was 11pm on a Saturday Fries were lukewarm McFlurry was watery and the cashier needed an attitude adjustment But if youre in need of a late night snack after a night out look no further
14068,4,Store stays pretty clean and food is made fresh
4020,4,Good 
3840,4,Good 
13602,4,I went two times during my visit at Orlando the first one I took a pizza it was s great experience have pizza at a McDonalds franchise the cons is that took about 50min to my pizza get done Second time a ordered a Deluxe Crispy Chicken and it was great fast service nothing to complain

4910,4,Good 
4908,4,Good 
4907,4,Good 
12978,4,Fast and friendly Usual McDonalds quality
12982,4,I dont eat at McDonalds but I do UberEats deliveries I love this McDonalds because it has a parking structure in an area that typically doesnt have one This makes it very convenient for me and people who choose to eat there
12987,4,It is just minutes away from the pier many homeless people inside and you should take good care of your belongings It is clean but employees barely smile and cold due to holiday working hours I guess  Had the double burger cheese and oats meal which I do not complain It is thanks giving holiday
4925,4,Good 
12928,4,When I come here the food is always hot
12927,4,The shakes are great Busy but never a wait

4958,4,Good 
4957,4,Good 
12871,4,It was okay but crowded It was nice for a good Saturday morning
12990,4,The Santa Monica location is on par with most McDonalds out there The food was satisfactory and the speed of service was reasonable My only problems with the experience were the restaurant was incredibly busy and the smell of pot was pretty strong from someone smoking it out on the patio They had the munchies I guess
12874,4,A little overrated but good
12880,4,It only took 5 minutes Not bad to be honest
4948,4,Good 
12888,4, Mm The Coffee Is Good And Food Local Very Cleaning
4947,4,Good 
4946,4,Good 
4945,4,Good 
4940,4,A McDonalds
12877,4,I got the 2 chicken sandwiches for 3 very good
12851,4,There was a long line at the drive through
12992,4,Its McDonalds 
4902,4,Good 
13079,4,They always have a lot of staff in hand specially on the week ends and at peak hours You will always see a lot of tourist due to the perfect location near the shopping and the pier This also means that there will be homeless there as well I like to live and let live so I dont mind sharing space with my fellow man With that said there is security at hand at all times Even when this place looks crowded the service is fast and like most McDonalds with a smile You get something to eat at a great price in a perfect location
13082,4,They accidentally gave my friends and I a whole order that we cancelled and they also gave us the actual orders we bought All in all they were pretty fast workers They have to be because that place is always packed because of the Santa Monica Pier I understand that its not always going to be clean there because frankly theres not much room to clean there most of the time If I could give 42 stars I would
13083,4,We ate breakfast here every morning while staying at a hotel around the corner The food was always made correct and fresh however the large amount of homeless people hanging out make things a little more difficult  No condiments are self serve  the security guard has to let you into the bathroom sometimes hard to find a table
13084,4,I just had a large fry it was okay the kids had hamburger happy meals the burgers were cold and tasted funny they ate the fries and of course really liked the toy inside 7 out of 10 today mediocre
13088,4,It was crowded Unfortunately they dont do refills here
13093,4,The service is fast but since the pandemic it seems that the mask is the most important thing security is polite and the Cusomer service associates are kinda formal but still politeyou can eat on the patio but not for long
13094,4,Its McDonalds cheap sustenance to keep on going We had a couple burgers and fries and I cant complain they were alright when the price is taken into account It can be quite busy at times so keep this in mind when going at peak times The restaurant itself was pretty clean what you come to expect from a McDonalds
4876,4,Always on time
13104,4,We only eat halal food The fillet o fish is a good choice for us but the price is high Though it
4874,4,Good 
4873,4,Clean
13110,4,Its a McDonalds it didnt disappoint I got another one supersize And thats what I wanted Fade Out on the floor back back back to get a bag over there balcony Exactly what I wanted no surprises
13112,4,12 midnight this place is packed and they bring it to your table
4872,4,Good 
4870,4,Good 
13070,4,No different than any other McDonalds except that its in Santa Monica very close to the pier and beach Its surprisingly well kept and clean and very fast Lots of tourists and visitors and the location is updated with the order kiosk systems so can get moving pretty fast Seating can be an issue on very crowded days Over all good experience and not too bad
13066,4,Convenient location and although there are some challenges the area faces homeless and everything that goes with that the restaurant does a good job keeping things clean service helpful and food good as always We had an order with a lot of custom requests for kids no this extra that and each burger was put together exactly as ordered
13063,4,Good McD centrally located and quick service
13062,4,Fine its always busy place
4901,4,Good 
12994,4,Its McDonaldsby the pier  McDonalds In the wee hours only time I go it can be colorful with the occasional altercationconflict but they have security  Never had a issue there  Order my food from the kiosk wait pu eat while I walk home and later wish that I didnt order 3 to 4 sandwiches
12998,4,Its a McDs fast food cause you dont have a lot of time when youre going somewhere Convenient place to grad a quick breakfast in the morning with all other shops still closed
13000,4,"It has been a mighty long time since I need ed to concern myself with dining in at McDonalds
Since Covid19 the option to dine in was removed Remarkable"
13007,4,Its not clean and there are no offers but still ok Bathroom is usually clean
13008,4,Lots of homeless people inside
4896,4,Good 
12993,4,Look the staff here is great despite the unwanted obvious nuisance Food is prepped fast and staff are professional Restroom are actually kept clean again despite certain unfortunate citizens I always take out from here and go to the beach Or park my car at the very top of the lot and eat there
4889,4,Well
13020,4,This McDonalds is conveniently close to Santa Monica Pier about 1 block away I love buying food from here and eating it by the shoreline with friends  Do note that workers can sometimes be very stingy or serious due to the large amount of people that come in daily this McDonalds in particular gets very packed So please be kind to them they are trying their best to get your food served 3
4887,4,Good 
13030,4,Its a Nice McDonalds due to location you can grab a small amount of food and go to the pier also people talk about beggers being near it but I didnt see any all I saw was a man overdosing on drugs
13044,4,"The only reason I am giving this location for stars instead of 5 is because overall I dont eat McDonalds or fast food However the one day that I did go to Santa Monica I just had a sudden craving for something fatty and sugary

I went inside and dislocation surprisingly very clean The staff there were also very hospitable friendly and alert I ordered me some french fries and a sweet iced tea and then I proceeded to the outdoor Courtyard to eat

Out there was just as clean as it was on the inside I havent had McDonalds since 2012 so I was really surprised at how fresh the french fries and the sweet iced tea taste it

Everything was okay okay with me"
13046,4,Always has an abundance of homeless population hanging out inside and outside Remove that you get 5 stars Felt dirty although they were constantly cleaning the restaurant Food is your typical McDonalds no change there They offer a bathroom but its a busy location Overall Id return with caution 
13055,4,There have been issues with some of the patrons getting out of hand with the staff but it seems that the issue has improved My family generally order through food delivery apps from this location to avoid unruly patrons They always get our order right and the delivery is seamless
13058,4,"Very nice very clean
Saw a guy come in who looked homeless and 2 security guards immediately swarmed in and ushered him out It was kind of impressive yet I felt so sorry for the guy and thought security should have been more sensitive when doing the job because the man clearly wasnt all there

Also the mens rest room was very clean however Id prefer paper towels on hand in addition the the blowers I had to touch the press down facet button and I had to touch the soup dispenser I like to use paper towels to touch these things especially the door when leaving"
13016,4,To be honest I usually frequent this local Santa Monica Micky Ds for its coffee I have to wake up pretty early so a nice jolt of caffeine helps me start the day at 5am With that being said I will also say that because of Santa Monicas influx of homelessness over the years this particular location gets alot of homeless patrons Most are nice and I buy some of the regulars a thing or two from time to time however its the aggressive homeless patrons that make the place feel troublesome The staff tries to placate situations but you can tell they are getting frustrated more and more everyday So if you cant handle talk be patient and react positively to people who are just trying to get through the day the dont go here I dont need you screaming and being annoyed at every little thing Bye
13120,4,They were friendly but they never gave me a tray because they never asked for here or to go The service was fast I had my food ready before I could fill up my drink
12848,4,They are So So but still Slow service
4972,4,Good

5030,4,Good 
12532,4,Was okay Place is clean and the staff were nice There was a crazy man in there making the place uncomfortable to be in I think he threatened one of the staff members I just got my two McChickens and then left before the cops came
12545,4,Busy and fast paced restaurant They do have play area for children
12546,4,"It was an ok expi got to meet new peopleand enjoy the company im with

5020,4,Good 
12575,4,Great place to eat
12580,4,Slow service because there is few people working there at 8 in the morning Janitor was nice to let us into the restrooms that require a keycode It was mostly empty in the dining area the line and the parking lot There was however a very long drivethru line
12491,4,Good service and very clean
12490,4,What to say its a Mcdo very recent
12487,4,consistent with what is expected of a Mc Donald
5048,4,Good

12469,4,Good place to eat after waiting at customs Own
12591,4,Great experience when I asked for more condiments twice other times some people get a bothered face x9 breath in breath out is my advice on that x
12474,4,Renovated Decorated with ambiance Table service A McDo with class
12477,4,Nice clean place
12478,4,The restaurant needs a facelift but it is still acceptable
12480,4,The first after the lines He is fine
12482,4,Very well located close to customs
12483,4,There are a lot of people  moving fast
12484,4,By the way I loved asking on the electronic blackboard
12485,4,The service is fast and the people are nice
12475,4,Nothing surprising the same as any other McDonalds but the bathrooms are a bit insufficient and therefore somewhat dirty
12845,4,It was clean and efficient Wish they had plugins for travelers
12598,4,Daughter wanted the Travis Scott burger She says its a hit or miss with her friends I ordered the newly freeze drink which gave me an adult brain freeze and it wasnt as sweet like the Icee back in the day I wouldnt order it again
12606,4,Wait time is too long and ordered french fries n it was cold
12756,4,The cashier was extremely patient when I allowed my son to order his own meal

12622,4,The place was great the person at the drive thru was so nice
12625,4,Although the two drive thru lines were pretty long when I got there  the service was very fast and accurate
12630,4,This is the only McDonalds that is close to my house but honestly I dont really like it For some reason they are always slow The drivethru is always packed
12641,4,Clean and modern inside
5010,4,Good 
5009,4,Good 
12602,4,Long drive through but always worth that unique McDonalds taste  The Filet O Fish with the humongous glob of tartar sauce that slides out NO matter how hard you try all over your shirt while youre driving  One of my favorites   As a favorite  I feel I shouldnt have towait for for it
12689,4,Its clean but a transit hub for the transit people  I took the bus there myself hahaha but Id like to imagine Im not ugly

13389,4,We love it
13522,4,Service wasnt all the friendly
4670,4,It was  ok
13579,4,"World largest McDonalds Food is the same they have pizza and pasta too The seating and ordering process was quick and easy but actually getting the food on time together was a challenge

Our burgers came in fairly fast 10 minutes or so but pizza took 30 minutes from the time when we ordered it I had to come down and ask for my order for them to give me the pizza

Honestly this worth a single visit especially the playground if you have kids If you looking for a quick bite I would go to the other locations with less people and quicker service"
13582,4,"This place is huge Large play place and fun arcade

Pizza at McDonalds Yup we tried it Overall it was delicious and had great flavor although the crust was a little thin for my liking

Overall fairly clean floors were a little sticky Bathrooms were clean"
4634,4,Im lovin it
13585,4,This location is nice and they deliver the food to your table Only 4 stars though because the food was cold when it arrived Probably would have given it 3 stars but I got 2 extra nuggets in my happy meal
4633,4,Great food
13589,4,"Worlds biggest McDonalds They serve Pizza and Pasta here I tried them both
To be honest I didnt know what to expect from the pasta but I guess i"
13591,4,Very cool place got food on menu you will not see at any other McDonalds  The pasta was cool but not the best Service was really good  Had a good time
13592,4,Overall a good experience at this McDonalds the largest in Florida if not the country a very big place I actually did not go upstairs to the arcade area just ate and ran But additional options here pizza and pasta I had both and both equally good   A little longer wait for those items so expect the additional cook
4631,4,It was ok
13594,4,Well I guess I checked something off my bucket list I didnt even know I had The WORLDS biggest McDonalds How cool Pasta on dishware  at McDonalds Yes please The place was a madhouse but worth it for the experience It was our first night visiting Orlando so we didnt let our kiddo run around the H U G E play area I know kinda mean But the amount of children in it and not knowing how often it was cleaned had me a little nervous Definitely worth the visit even for just a cheeseburger And KUDOS to all employees this place is NUTS AND a drivethru Bless yall
13595,4,This was a great experience I was staying at Orlando for a week and this was one of the places I wanted to go to The pizza was really good Mac tonight was also there which was mind blowing My only complain was the pizza was pretty greasy but other then that I would recommend this for people staying at Orlando
4630,4,Good
13597,4,"The food was quality but service took a while

I liked the food a lot I had heard of the location having pizza and pasta so I got both I also got a large fries a burger and drinks Me and my party enjoyed the food and honestly the pizza was in some ways better than other pizza places

Only con
Id recommend going through the drive through and not getting the special items only because the wait when you order pizza or pasta is increasing fast Not sure if this is a regular issue but seems like when I have gone its like this"
13598,4,"Not entirely sure what I expected when going to the worlds largest McDonalds  I mean its just a fast food place right Wrong

The place is huge  brick ovens for thin and crispy pizzas hand crafted pasta and speciality meal stations the everyday McDonalds kitchen then followed by a staircase to an arcade playhouse and more sit down area

The pizza was only 10 after toppings It was a small personal pie  thin and crispy b"
13599,4,Great place for the kids playground  and playroom are great I recommend  you the 30 min for just 5 play card while waiting for your food it can take longer that other McDonald very busy place
4637,4,Good service
4639,4,Good service
13575,4,This McDonalds is one of the nicest and coolest McDonalds Ive ever been to It is a two story McDonalds with a play place and an arcade They offer non traditional menu options such as build your own pasta ravioli pizza cake cheese cake etc it truly is a one of a kind McDonald
13572,4,The staffs were very friendly and our food was good The facility was clean They were very busy and our food was was good However our food was not delivered until about 30 minutes after we placed our order We wanted to try McDonalds pasta I

13195,4,Was a McDonalds You know what you get The store itself was clean the service was prompt and the people were nice The automated ordering machines were a pain to use though and we gave up as it was unresponsive
13198,4,Kind of  confusing as people were just standing everywhere and one of the workers looked lost herself Once it cleared out some t hmm ings settled the food was accurate and warm 
13202,4,This is my go to McDonalds now with automated cashiers ordering is quick and easy nice and clean courteous employees its just getting better
13210,4,No bad location easy to find service is kinda slow at times though
13211,4,The food was great Service was quick They forgot napkins and ketchup for my to go order
4834,4,Good like every McDonalds
13222,4,Its McDonalds fast and cheap and admitted one of my guilty pleasures Sometime I just want a cheap hamburger even if I could grill up a gourmet at home
13223,4,It was too busy There going put the door I suggest going to the one of the many local eateries they are all much better than here
13226,4,What you expect from McDonalds  cheap unhealthy fare Went here to grab a late night bite Got my order for a mango banana smoothie wrong but replaced promptly
13227,4,The place was busy but the food came out fast and was acceptable for a McDonalds Overall not too bad
13228,4,I like the way you order your food Its all automated which is great The food came out quickly
13229,4,I mean it s a McDonald so you know what you get At the same time the prices around the place make you wanna come here

13134,4,The food was fast and good for McDonalds The inside seating area was kinda small and there were a lot of homeless people hanging out in front of the building The entrance smelled like urine
13135,4,"They literally almost got the entire order wrong would not come back ever My family got two deluxe s round egg 1small decaf coffee 2 med coffees with sugar and cream We ended up with packets of ketchup no bread for the muffins in the deluxesno hashbrowns and the wrong amount of cream

Ok sorry I actually came back the other day and the food was amazing this time Also there is another McDonalds in my area thats pretty lame This place has a better service overallsort of long review sorry"
13140,4,The recently advertised 100 real meat patties for their Quarter Pounder burger more or less was what you expectsame great taste same great value though it did not fail it however didnt feel any different from their other burger options on their selected menu  Would I get it again  Yeah why not  Makes for a mouth watering meal on the go quick to be served and ready in minutes with that first warm juicy bite followed by a second third and maybe fourth  Who knows really  Just Get It and Try One Out Today or When the Munchies hit Mount Everest peaks
13142,4,Its mc donalds what can i say
13145,4,The interior of store has recently been upgraded and has made it a lot more pleasant to be in Due to its proximity to the Pier there are still plenty of weirdos and homeless people hanging out in and around the store
13147,4,Lines can be long but service is friendly Sometimes it takes longer for the food to come out but the employees compensate by doing extra for the wait The employees do practice good customer service
13148,4,Its an interesting location for a McDonalds and this property must be super expensive Aside from that its a good enough place and I give it 4 stars based on the expectations that come from a McDonalds to begin with If youre on the Pier and you want a big Mac or some mcnuggets this is your spot
13239,4,Great food great costumer service very very fast with order turn around less than 3 minutes way less bums there
13151,4,They get you in and out fast I love this McDonalds adjacent to the beach  and the Metro Expo Line

3013,4,Although this particular McDonalds is located in the heart of Manhattan the service was very friendly just not very expeditious The food was consistent with McDonalds Fair so I guess it was okay overall I mean its McDonalds you going to like it or you dont and Im sure most people thats reading this have at least visited one in the lifetime if not more and theyre different depending on who you go to and what day but the food to be consistent if the food sucks everything about the experience sucks okay have a great day until my next one
3012,4,I Rarely frequent McDonalds as a brand but your beautifully remodeled location diagonal from Penn Station is the ONLY place you can get ice coffee and a breakfast sandwich at 530 in the morning The staff that was on the first time I went where pleaser and efficient The second time I wentI had to use the kioskwhich frustrated me  I rather interact with humans A young lady from the back came out to help me place my orderand I was an appreciative and satisfied customer that morning

2966,4,Good 
16402,4,This place has clean restroom The parking is free but is mostly full and requires some wait to park The dining area is not so big but clean The cashier was friendly and welcoming I like that breakfast was served all day
16399,4,"A little small for my taste It is one of the older McDonalds so it doesnt have outlets
The staff is great though There is one dude that works in the morning that is always so nice and it seems like he never has a bad day None of the staff as far as I have seen discriminate against homeless people Their humanity gets them the extra star"

16400,4,Beware of the parking it is very crowded and the drive through is inconveniently located  very closely to row of cars backing up and when gets crowded if you are backing up you may have to wait or  even worse get hit by a car backing up I actually saw this  Not a big fan of McDonalds food but the fries are classic and a tea no sugar is refreshing  My order is always small fries and large tea no sugar  Service is always great
2894,4,Good 
16225,4,Good 
16313,4,Had to order at the kiosk Good was fast and freshly made great for a quick meal on the go The interior of the place was very sterile No menus above the counter This location was just remodeled too not liking it at all
2846,4,They dont sell salads
2838,4,Ah OK
16345,4,A bit of a long line in the drive thru but the workers where moving the lines along They friendly at the windows
2834,4,Good 
16348,4,Hot fries and standard fare Can get very very busy in weekend nights at the drive through
16353,4,I want to return to this McDonalds some day when the pandemic ends The lobby looks cozy to dine in
2831,4,Nice A typical McDonalds
16356,4,24 hrs Isnt that enough Hot coffee Comfort food
2826,4,I liked
2820,4,Good 
2814,4,Good service attitude fast food delivery less queuing time
16379,4,It was clean It was not too crowded The items I ordered were up fast Its a place to go when you dont have a lot of dough and not a lot of time I try to eat healthy but sometimes you just need something fast
16384,4,Decent McDonalds newly rebuilt quick drive through  Sometimes foods been under heatlamp a bit long though
16392,4,Little bit of a wait but thats pretty much everything in LA chicken came out hot and they remembered the sauces The location didnt look too shabby but if they had a larger parking lot they could probably not contribute to the traffic on the street  Its McDonalds not a chicfila  you get what you pay for
16309,4,Its a newly renovated McDonalds has a very skinny drive thru so be cautious Its advertised as 24 hours but isnt always open 24 Have gotten food here several times since reopening Every time food has been hot and tasted fresh Customer service was surprisingly good Will up date in the future Trying to eat healthieryou should as well Fat food hould never be a daily thing Warning 
2849,4,Good service
2850,4,It is quiet and comfortable
16305,4,"In contrast to the many radical reviews this location was slick modern new  clean Small downstairs because the kitchen is upstairs At 400 pm there were about 3 to 4 times more cars lined up to get to the drivethru than there were people inside My food was fine nothing too positive or negative
This IS a McDonalds not your family BBQ"

2865,4,Good 
16287,4,I stated at a near by hotel This was the only thing around open late Only the drive thru was open The drive thru took 30 min When it was my turn to order the cashier skip my lane and helped 3 car from the other lane first
2861,4,Good 
16291,4,Theres nothing special about a big Mac Im not sure about this location but Ive definitely paid 18 for a big mac meal Better at better prices elsewhere
16294,4,The fries were hot but barely had salt on it I couldnt taste any flavor
16295,4,The girl taking our order was so incredibly nice She was helpful and cheerful and really got our day off to a great start The food was great and and it was done quickly
2856,4,Good 
16267,4,Good 
14418,4,Its McDonaldswhat can I say The staff is very friendly
15523,4,It was great I had a birthday party there for a sibling The staff was really nice they gave us some extra happy meals because they messed up our cake we are the great time we had cookies and had a bunch of fun Id recommend coming here it was nice
15522,4,They have a great deal on drinks and since I dont eat meat the main reason I ever drive through is to get a drink and sometimes an ice cream cone This time the ice cream machine was broken It seems to happen with some frequency I guess they serve lots of shakes and ice cream
14807,4,Dont have to wait for a long time the walk up line was fast and my order was right the first time
3629,4,It was very quiet and clean Good place to have breakfast
14814,4,Can
3624,4,Good very quiet place to have breakfast near Penn Station
14817,4,Friendly customer service through drive thru service was great Friendly pleasant staff offering fast service as well
3618,4,Always McDonalds They are well organized here
14826,4,Most have no idea the historic significance of this McDonalds  Back in the 60s ALL McDonalds restaurants were driveinsmeaning no indoor seating  You ate in your car or standing outside  Oak Park had an ordinance that stated no drivein restaurants but Ray Kroc founder of McDonalds wanted a McDonalds in his home town  So in order to get approval to be built THIS very McDonalds  agreed to install stand up hitop tables inside so technically you could eat inside  It was to my knowledge the first McDonalds ever where you could sit inside and eat  As I recall it opened inaround 1966 or so  It was a VERY big deal around the area
3614,4,Definitely better than what we are used to in Italy
3610,4,For selfhelp travel choosing fast food is the most convenient way to solve meals When you are in a foreign country you think it is unpalatable but it is actually quite delicious
14837,4,One of the best McDonalds near Chicago Fresh Food
3606,4,Exactly the same as all MacDonalds They had a cheap menu of 1 2 and 3 dol I didnt like them because they gave me heartburn the 2 times I ate
3604,4,A little cleaning in the client room
14848,4,McDonalds is McDonalds theyre famous because every restaurant tastes the same good quality fresh  hot drivethru experience
14849,4,Courteous service and good food  It was not a long wait in drivethru
3602,4,We were only here for drinks 1 for a large drink was a welcome price in expensive New York
14802,4,They can handle a custom order but the wait time is usally longer than it should be at this location
14801,4,Ive loved this place since I was a child I miss the play place They need to make them everywhere as a requirement I am glad they brought the happy meal boxes back 
14799,4,The place is clean they mostly get your order right Serve us fast But it can be really crowded
3634,4,They treated me well and delivered what I requested the computers did not have clear options to place the order
14713,4,Shoe store was nice and clean all the shoes are in place customer service was terrific the problem that I have is that it does not go up to size 12 and dress shoes for women
14725,4,Long lines but thats McDonalds for you when they are selling crack I mean two all beef patties with special sauce on a sesame seed bun The problems lies when you have a big order at the drive through You must hold the line to make sure you got everything you ordered because you dont want to have to go inside or go through the drive through again Quite a dilemma
14726,4,Ordered my food Just your typical McDonalds  The special orders were all correct Slight wait and the manager gave me two free holiday pie desserts for the hassle Excellent customer recovery and service
3646,4,Even though there are many homeless people who enter the service is good
3641,4,Good place to eat an appetizing meal outside of medical recommendations
3639,4,New orders are made digital in stores and there are fish combos here in New York
14771,4,Completely serviceable Not the best but not the worst location by far Could use with a few sectors hands keeping the tables clean But food is hot and fast
14851,4,Food was hot and tasty No long wait at all
14772,4,McDonald team work fast and efficient very few McDonalds have short line they get the job done Thank you Mary P
14777,4,Im only giving them 4 starts because the corporation sucks But Ive always had great experience with the employees
14780,4,Its McDonaldsliterally no more and not one iota less We all need a reliably bland calorierich meal from time to time           Ronald Mac  I salute you
3637,4,Beautiful place the attention was very good
14784,4,Food was good  Check your fries prior to leaving  Mine were cold
14785,4,Was busy but service was nice Touch menu needs update couldnt order my Frappuccino with extra caramel 
3636,4,It is mc but the space is very small In that city at rush hour you cant find where to sit
14794,4,This is my spot on the regular  Tonight they shorted me three orders of fries and sometimes the sweet tea is too sweet
3638,4,The attention is excellent wifi etc Like in your country Economic
14709,4,They can be very slow when you go inside to order but the they focus more on the drive thru then the people inside But overall its okay and maybe it depends on the day that you come
14856,4,Very very slow drive thru
14857,4,I love visiting this location because i never had a problem with customer service
3551,4,Good 
14945,4,Nice to cook fresh fries

14882,4,Good hot food served quickly kinda pricey
3585,4,This is a rather well decorated and pleasant McDonalds In addition to being fabulously located in the middle of the gigantic skyscrapers of Broadway this place is not excessively crowded which makes it even more pleasant And finally a fundamental and important detail these days there is Wifi So I recommend this place 
3584,4,The best thing about it is its location but the quality of its food its appearance and taste and service I give it a 3
3597,4,A traditional MC Do its fast and its good You can take a break and enjoy the WiFi

15368,4,"UPDATE 2021 This is a solid restaurant My food has always been made to McDonalds standards They have very busy times which is in part due to their location on the highway in a restaurant area but also because they are a solid restaurant Their curbside service gives you an estimate of your wait which is appreciated and your food will be delivered by a friendly employee an improvement from my previous experience My only complaint is that its obvious they make your curbside drink far earlier than your delivery because they come to you partially melted see the slush below

2019
They identified my "
3298,4,Quick service Regular for Macdonalds food
15424,4,"We wanted to dinein Nope

Drive in line was huge and took a long time

First order of fries was cold even with the crazy long line Didnt make any sense to me

They fixed the fry issue IMMEDIATELY and with kindness

Heres the deal the staff there HAD TO BE OVERWHELMED

They better be making 25 an hour at least"

9373,4,"From a quick visit about 4 months ago

Dining room was small seemed clean my order was togo so didnt spend much time inside

Loved the digital menuselforder kiosks ordered at the kiosk and it still gave the option to pay cash at the register though not sure if that options still available andor if the dining rooms even open right now

Staff was friendly enough and very helpful packed my togo order like absolute pros

The area where the fountain drinks straws etc are wasnt super tidy a bit of a spill on the countertop if memory serves however seemed clean otherwise

Because it was such a quick trip didnt get to see the condition of the bathrooms a good indicator of an establishments working and overall conditions in my experience Maybe another time

Overall a good experience

Something to consider theres no drivethrough nor a parking lot and finding a parking space seems to be a nightmarehitormiss in that area Circled the surrounding blocks a few times before someone parked almost right in front of the store just happened to be leaving not sure how often that happens though Score

The previous parking spot Id found was about 2 blocks away doable but kept searching in order to be closer to the other establishment my group and I were visiting prior to McDs"
6845,4,Average for a McDonalds Nothing special about it Was a bit dirty ehrn I was there
6842,4,Who doesnt like the classic fries
9388,4,Stopped by for breakfast a few times while in town  Self order kiosks were great but didnt have directions I ordered without issue but watched a few people walk out after not being able to figure it out and having
6841,4,It was ok as any other McDonalds Ive seen in Brooklyn
6833,4,Very fast service
9401,4,Food was great but 15 dollars for breakfast for one person Wow

9369,4,Clean plenty of places to sit and enjoy your meal
9368,4,Its McDonalds what is there to say  I love the relatively reasonable prices not sure why a double cheeseburger is on the 1 menu but the single hamburger is almost twice the price or why a small fries is 249 but they allowed me to pay what I usually pay for lunch at Panera  and not only feed myself a hamburger but get the homeless and disabled person asking for money outside the front door a meal that he asked for a double cheeseburger and a slushie when I didnt have any cash
9365,4,Washington DC downtown five blocks from the White House so do the math I had the munchies I needed to eat McDonalds is the place

9321,4,Late night run to McDonalds Great service
7007,4,Can not beat mcdonalds for their quick service and food  Though their best menu item is still the coffee
6999,4,They did not give us straws we had to go back through the DriveThru and wait in a big line of cars has 2 lanes for ordering and was actually pretty busy They were a the on the slow site but we just figured it was all the people coming back to get their straws other than that it was just your regular McDonalds experience very grateful it was open though since covid you dont find to many 24 hrs locations that still actually stay open all night as hours state That in itself is a whole different issue and honestly very difficult to figure out without driving down an unlit window on a drivethru with a sign stating were open 24 Hours I gave it a 4 because food was warm and fresh and drinks were on point except luck of a straw
6988,4,That day I brought the kids having activities in South Bay Santa Clara After the event I tried to bring the kids to mcdi went two and they both closed at 6pm At least the south city mcd dining room opens till 10pm
6987,4,"I would have given 5 stars but the lady MNGR that took my order got one item wrong  I did not notice until I was long gone Also the COVID headache is pretty much behind us but for some odd reason this location still has a limitedrestricted dining room even to the point of closing it down completely at 300pm everyday I can understand being cautious  prepared but to use the pandemic as a way to justify limitingrestricting areas of an establishment  that we as patrons normally use on any normalregular day is unprofessional inconvenient  just a way for them to make it easier to keep clean  one less thing to be done when it comes to closing down for the night
However though this ranting  raving I am doing in this post I still get good customer service there when I do go for a quick  easy meal  Their drive thru is  conveniently open 24 hrours"
9170,4,They were very slow at the drive up Their food was ok
9174,4,Hot food was hot Cold food cold Tasted fresh good service
6968,4,"New store technology and modern layout Hope their food and service are at same level after the remodeling

They forgot to replace the soda machine Ohohh"
9185,4,Now with selfservice kiosks so you can be sure to get a correct order
6956,4,I like the fact it has longer hours then most of them If only some of the employees that work drive thru were alittle more friendly Instead of being short fused and somewhat rude
6954,4,"Popular restaurant for people
Location is convenient  parking is easy
I use drive through most of the time
Prices are a few cents than other locations in this area in some items prices are varied with restaurant locations"
9203,4,Stop here almost every morning before work Bacon egg and cheese biscuit is delicious
6953,4,I never dine in but if I do eat here it is through the drive thru They always have great customer service which is really nice The food sometimes is not so great Either ingredients are missing probably do to food outage and sometimes my food is cold which is super undesirable This place isnt bad it could definitely improve
9208,4,Clean nice people Chicken strips were overcooked and rubbery even when I got a second order
6952,4,Love McDonalds Been eating them since the Super Size days Finally they have fresh beef burgers Would you eat it this pink
6945,4,Kinda dirty floors but ok

7025,4,Good fast food They are open 24 hours a day which is great if you are working a night shift graveyard shift or have to go in early in the morning Their new menu is actually quite good I do wish the McRib was back in season but oh well you cant have it all Try the Minutemaid Slushies They are outstanding
9148,4,Their very fast my food was great

8382,4,Like all McDonalds
7223,4,I get good service the employees are friendly this is the way it should always be
7220,4,Breakfast is always good at Mc dees the coffee wow dont need a redbull

8912,4,Always good and this location is open for drive through 247 We ordered a 2 cheese burger meal and a fish sand meal It was very good
7206,4,Burgers were good but the fries were cold and they almost forgot one of our sandwiches
8913,4,This particular McDonalds had a hobo chilling in there He asked for a sandwich and I got him a sausage McMuffin Then this punk decides thats not enough and steals my buddys order How messed up is that Like I get youre hungry but so was my friend
7199,4,McRib came out really well crafted No complaints service was average

8777,4,Orders are always accurate and well made  I havent usually had to wait long at the drive thru  They are not currently offering dinein service
8794,4,Loved my watermelon slush at 10 PMthank you 24 hour McDonalds
8796,4,Ok for fast food  Parking lot and drive thru traffic makes the lot dangerous Poorly designed Usually always crowded  The worst is when they ask you to pull up to 2 window to wait for your food and then they serve 5 cars behind you while you sit there and wait
8802,4,Never had a problem here except my last order we forgot our drinks in drive through and got someone elses order which only fed my daughter but Im sure it was a simple mistake to make no fus over besides i got cereal for dinner haha
8808,4,I visited McDonalds today and got a big Mac No complaints The food was good and I got what I expected The servers were courteous and I got my food fairly quick They got me in and out All in all a great visit
7258,4,Well its McDonalds food was hot and but as usual you cant tell what youre saying because theyre all foreign
8821,4,This location is always very busy They are Fairly quick at serving people but the lines are very long especially in the drive through Staff never seems very friendly maybe bc they see so many ppl
8926,4,They had those cool self order things They werent super responsive though and it was kind of annoying Everything else was good or at least normal for McDonalds
7254,4,Good option to just drive in My kid really like Happy Meal Value for money
7252,4,Good drive thru Has napkins accessible Corporate branch
8839,4,This store was ok the employees could have been a lit nicer and at least act like they was some what thankful they had a job and the food showed how the employees where acting witch was ok but now good

9060,4,Long lines Took long time to get service
9066,4,they
7134,4,service pretty good for McDonalds I find myself going out of the way for their drive thru coz their order accuracy is on point
7132,4,Its a McDonalds They are all pretty similar But the bathrooms are clean and the staff is friendly I find it interesting that they removed the charging stations But once again McDonalds not Starbucks
7130,4,this place has the best shamrock shakes if you go during March the shamrock shakes are amazing its really affordable just kidding thats why its actually pretty expensive cause its so good but you wont regret purchasing a shamrock shake
7127,4,"I am just wondering why so many people writing reviews for a McDonald Are they all the same everywhere And who has not taste a McDonald before

So do not expect it to be as good as a decent restaurant but it will do when you are hungry"
9078,4,I was impressed with the self help menu machines My order took only one minute
7124,4,Ive gone to this location a few times and my fries and limo every dang time Nuggets were fresh but fries were a waste of money
9019,4,The drivethrough workers were extremely  helpful and verified my order at both windows  I was impressed with that
9012,4,Food is usually pretty fresh at this location Make sure to check your order when you use drive thru
7144,4,The best thing about this place is that it is open 24x7 But then they are slow at times also for the drive through so I recommend to have enough time in hand
9006,4,Super quick and correct even with modifications
7184,4,Always download the app and get the deals there The best
8951,4,The customer service is a lot better then the McDonalds off of 3300s

7177,4,The filet o fish was fresh Hot with a crispy rust soft on the inside
7173,4,Drive thru was great and the person that took the order is nice and friendly
7187,4,Kiosh not available for use  Otherwise your usual experience
7170,4,Sometimes some employee doesnt pay attention and been standing there but no one is  coming  to helpsometimes it shows attitude too
8971,4,Great service and clean establishment Fountain soda machine didnt work properly during my visit and got just syrup
7167,4,This McDonalds is almost always busy  While its not the quickest the staff here are always friendly and there are excellent deals waiting in the McDonalds app
7166,4,Whats the say about McDonalds wherever you go by McDonalds to default favorite True Value Meal service is always good and the food quality is always good its not for me the price is right
8991,4,Customer service was in okay I wish I spoke a little Spanish it would have been better if you know what Im saying
7157,4,Would have appreciated more of that awesome sauce on my 20piece nuggets but great experience overall
7153,4,This place has that usual McDonalds quality Which isn
7149,4,Fish sandwich was cold and French vanilla latte tasted horrible when I went at about 1am
7168,4,Awhile back I made a bad review but since then major improvements to the restaurant and the service have been made Solid McDonalds
7474,4,Its mcdees what the can you add
8757,4,I would love the exact location McDonalds i dined at This one employee only seemed to be against having me eat there The woman cashier literally didnt want to order with the 2 for one menu sandwich deal i just recieved on on my phone She wouldnt offer me a pen to write my code on the receipt so i used a penny to write the code so she tells me its invalid but i wrote the exact code and it looked as though i wrote in oencile She immediately try calling security so i asked the other employees for a manager The manager was very understanding and even after helped with all and left to the back the woman tells me how this is my last order and i have 14 minutes left to eat It was ammusing so i played the idiot customer roll I definitely appreciate the managers understanding for i was also a little short on exact cash so you can already guess how the woman treated me about that On the plus side I enjoyed my meal 
8724,4,The line was pretty long but they moved us along fairly quickly Food was warm and my order was correct Not much else to say about a fast food joint
7414,4,Nice service
8445,4,The food is good but the portions are very small for the price The attention is good the place clean and organized the bathroom clean and modern I love McDonalds
8447,4,On several occasions I have gone I bought and then I did not get what I asked for or requested and I have to exchange it for something else They should be more aware of their inventory
7413,4,Well maintained corporate owned
8450,4,It is a place to take the children to have them play They often get the orders wrong But overall its not that bad
7412,4,Cheap food Make sure you get a straw
8455,4,The mask against the virus did not let me speak English well with the girl from the driver though up
7409,4,Good food Good service
7403,4,Decent area and good service
8473,4,"The prices are better in Utah than Idaho or Minnesota Also the McDonalds app has great deals If you do the survey on the recite than you get a buy one get one free discount
Since I have frequented McDonalds for a long time I must admit that I have mixed sentiments regarding the eatery On the one side the meal is typically pretty decent and I like the quick and convenient service However there are some problems that Ive come to realize over time that make me feel like the experience isnt as positive as it once was

The rising costs of the products on the menu are one of my main worries Every time I visit McDonalds it seems like the costs have increased once again This makes it challenging to continue frequenting them as much as I once did especially with the availability of more economical fast food alternatives

Another problem is that McDonalds used to give frequent and significant discounts and promotions but lately they seem to be less frequent and generous This is disappointing because Ive always valued the ability to occasionally save a few dollars on my lunch

Having said that there are still a few aspects of McDonalds that I genuinely value The majority of the cuisine is delicious and good and the quickness of service is still unmatched The restaurant is always spotless and wellkept making it a perfect choice if you need a fast dinner on the run Overall I would say that McDonalds is still a good option for fast food but because of the rising costs and less promotions it has lost its place as my top pick However a typical McDonalds burger and fries are a great choice if youre searching for a quick and delectable dinner"
7400,4,For a lunch on the go  not too shabby of a place
7399,4,Not too bad for McDonalds
7398,4,Under construction No drive thru
8488,4,"It was very cheap compared to what Im used to in California 20 can easily buy two full combo meals likely even more

8528,4,Nobody spoke English well enough to get my order correct The food sucked as did the employees who were dirty and unkempt almost as bad as the restaurant was NEVER AGAIN
8530,4,Its McDonalds you know the food and taste there it never changes
7314,4,Clean and not too busy McDonalds Maybe the competition is keeping them in check
8640,4,"The 1 cheeseburgers and chicken sandwiches I order from every McDonalds were noticeably better here The extra onions were actually noticeable at this location but what really caught my attention was the beef patty It was still hot when I got and juicy too so I know it was fresher than most other McDonalds The chicken patty was still hot too and I could taste the spice more than usual as well

This would have been a 55 but the drive through speakers wasn"
8646,4,I mean its McDonalds you
8666,4,Pretty good experience considering I didnt buy anything this time  Not too spectacular to get around the peeps hangin around outside for no reason but it IS downtown and the only McDonalds for a pretty big radius  Inside was pretty good with the new selforder station things  Theyve recently done some good renovations  Not too shabby McDs not too shabby
7305,4,I love the breakfast
8669,4,Tad bit slow in drive through  But other than that usual MC Donalds experience and consistent taste Value for money breakfast
7302,4,Good mcds Fast service consistent food
8674,4,Newly remodeled very clean for now Service was pretty decent I would say slightly better than average as far as McDonalds is concerned I love using the app to place mobile orders much easier that way especially during the lunch rush Food was well its McDonalds Pretty average food too
7300,4,"Your topical neighborhood Fast Food Place
The outdoors sitting is a nice hang out place"
8687,4,I spend a lot of money at this location and I havent really ever had a bad experience the only downfall with this restaurant is it states that it is 24 hours yet it is closed during hours of the night and as I just stopped to get my breakfast this morning after 600 am it was closed again sometimes they are even closed in the middle of the day so it is not always open as stated but it has always treated me well when it comes to customer service and food quality
8692,4,Always professional and quick very convenient on the way to the highway Do not park here if youre just going to the liquor store i have been booted before Still come here though cause good service

7356,4,Stopped for some fast food
7354,4,The McDs on Augustine Dr is much better
8568,4,They are good at making McDonalds food
8579,4,Literally the best mcdonalds to go to in the early early am but watch out for the overcooked or stale fries Hardly ever been there and systems updating or down so its my go to spot when alot of places are closed
8590,4,Due to the app I had a Bic Mac with no purchase necessary I wasnt looked down upon and was treated like everyone else I did but a soda but still They did not know that I was going to do that
7337,4,Super clean and fast fast food restaurant

11705,4,Very good service
11709,4,JUST LIKE OTHER MCDONALDS
11722,4,drive thru good
11742,4,Nice and clean
11743,4,Was fine this time
5518,4,Ooo
11750,4,like the chicken mcgriddles
5466,4,Just like every other McDonalds
11752,4,Eh Its McDonalds
11754,4,Fast and ok
5513,4,Its was ok
11764,4,Cool
11766,4,Quick as usual
5506,4,Its McDonalds  What do you want
11773,4,Fine
5505,4,It was ok
11753,4,Fast and clean
5526,4,Good
11836,4,Quick breakfast place
5463,4,Pretty good fast food
5427,4,Just a mac donald Drive thru was pretty fast when I went there late
5422,4,Very friendly employees wait time in drivethru is substantial on most days
11906,4,Very clean and has a kiosk that you can order Drive through is available as well
5415,4,Fast and friendly place
11915,4,Typical McDonalds fast service
11929,4,"The food is good Orders get filled properly There were 2 PAST experiences when my order was messed and once I waited 2 hours for my order to be done properly
I"
11933,4,The service was great surprisingly Our food was hot and they actually had our order completely correct Which is a big plus for this McDonalds I do recommend McDonalds if you go at the right times
5401,4,I love the staff but the little Mac lack luster the buns was dry and the patty was burnt
5400,4,Not the best customer services but its McDonalds the food was good
5398,4,Staff is friendly and helpful Parking makes you scratch your head wondering What were they thinking
5392,4,The staff was nice the restaurant is just a little small so be aware
11946,4,"Service is slow even even when the place is empty I wouldnt dare go when the place is actually busy Its a bit expected since its so close to the border
The interior seems pretty clean and the customer service is decent Ive only been on days when its not busy so my experiences have been decent"
11956,4,I usually go there every morning but my order usually gets messed up at least once a week with that being said they do replace my meal for free on the following visit
11960,4,"Stuff is super polite and nice and helpful 4 stars because if you pay at a kiosk grab a receipt and a table number find a place proudly install the number on top of it and wait you are sort of in a limbo your order is not shown on any display you have no clue when and how you will be served
We waited for a good 20 min and then I just asked a very nice and polite servant if I did everything correctly and when we will be served He said all is ok and they just have too many orders at this time but he said I will help
Suggestion to the higher management
All orders numbers have to be on one of the displays otherwise there are no feedback to the paid clients and with a less passionate clients you may have issues
What is for sure is that this situation decreases efficiency of the floor workers since the current state of kiosk order processing creates a situation in which ppl will be asking questions that can easily be fixed by software upgrade

5430,4,Fast accurate service Food was fresh
11894,4,Stopped in for a quick visit at this newly built location Nice bright dining room with fresh flowers on the tables The usual self ordering screens or a helpful staff behind the counter waiting to take your order If you are in need of food on the go this location has you covered Two drive through lanes and mobile order curbside spots so as to get you back on the road faster As McDonalds go this is a great improvement

11338,4,Getting better with service  Nice people
11346,4,The staff has to constantly deal with the homeless community that is always loitering around this place The McDonalds restaurant is clean and the food is up to par but the environment could be better
11543,4,Have been going to a McDonalds for decades And all over the USA and Europe  This is my local one
11348,4,Four stars only because its open 24 hours not just the drive thru and is one of the few late night bathroom options for Lyft and Uber drivers  Popular with the homeless crowd for the same reason though and its still a McDonalds eat at your own risk
5645,4,Good 
5643,4,Good 
11366,4,Good food good attitudes of the employees only downside is the main lobby floor was very sticky almost to the point of me walking out of my sandles
11367,4,Inflation is really hitting americans
11368,4,It was smooth Fries were fresh Shake was on point This location is a good one Location by my house is trash  Lol
11380,4,Great for a late night snack However there needs to be more workers at night as it seems there are long wait times for food during the late night hours
11406,4,The staff has always be friendly helpful and knowledgeable about the stores products  8590 of the time the service is quick
11350,4,Newly remodeled outside of store Looks great Fast drive through Sometimes there are too many homeless hanging around in or outside the parking lot
5530,4,Decent place

11263,4,This McDonalds was and normally is always very fast and my orders always correct The only thing is the past few times Ive been my chicken sandwich was not good at all and the French fries were not fresh but then pumpkin and holiday pies were the best The staff is always nice tho You cant dine in or done on their patio You cant use their restrooms either They do wear face masks and require you to wear one when going inside the establishment Theyre 24hours in their drive thru not exactly sure about going inside to  because the last time I went inside to order I was there around 9pm and they were still open for togo orders Breakfast hours are Monday thru Sunday starting at 4am Monday t
11972,4,Easy and clean  place to stop once you come back into the US  from the Canadian border  The coffee is good and restroom is clean Decour is a bit dated but the food comes out fast and taste  the way it should

12256,4,Right at the US Canada border fast service
5179,4,Good 
12079,4,Food was fresh and the staff was very polite Only had to wait a bit
5313,4,The food was good and fresh but the order was missing the fries I had ordered with the combo I ordered but didnt get the receipt and when I tried telling them the order was missing an item they told me I needed a receipt I get that but the fact that they didnt give me one and I gave them the order number and everything even showed them the order I received but they still wouldnt give me the item that was missing
12082,4,Very nice folks for me my breakfast in record time Obviously McDonalds cannot be compared to a steakhouse or similar
12083,4,Better than McDonald
5300,4,"Quick accurate drive through Maybe too quick when not sure what is being ordered I asked about new 6 deal She rattled off what comes with deal and placed order and gave total before I could digest what she said  Slow down
Fries were perfect I love the fries"
5285,4,Glad I walked in The drivethru line was ginormous TWO lines Ordering inside was pretty easy  a couple order kiosks or a plexibarriered pair of cash registers Time spent waiting was a lot less than if waiting in the drive thru laness Clean tables and floor  actually being mopped while I was there
5279,4,Ive been here before and given them 1 star due to slow processing of order been here again and it change  so giving them 4 star lets come back and check again next time
12089,4,Best McDonald they even have flowers on the table I felt like Princess Kate when she has breakfast at the Birmingham palace
5274,4,Well no body tells you you have to order in the machines cause supposedly they take orders and the register but not body comes to get your order I wait  and wait  and wait for 8 mint aproximily and no one get my order and did and the machine but the company had to understand no all the people can order like people use glasses and forget them  old people dont know the technology or you dont bring your card to pay  I know is easier but at least have to be one person to take your order on these cases  Well is my respectfully opinion
12098,4,Although slow service at least it is newly renovated and has selfserve machines
12103,4,Good place to eat if u want something fast and your in a hurry
12105,4,It was cool until this old white guy walks up and gets in front of me in line as if i wasnt standing there
5267,4,Driving can be a bit awkward here with a sightly confusing entranceexit and with very limited parking that can get clogged when there are cars entering or leaving  That said theyve consistently done a good job filling my orders and never given me any reason to complain in that regard
5265,4,Drive thru friendly and the request on how u want your food they complykristy very friendly real customer service
5264,4,"Fast and reliable McDonalds the McFlurry machine is always working which is a nice bonus

The IPU boys can lick my butt"
5317,4,Mobile ordering has made buying easier and coupled with their unbeatable deals makes for great fast food As others have said parking is scarce and cramped and the interior is VERY cramped I recommend drive through all the way
12074,4,Same as any other McDonalds
12071,4,The McDonalds next to the boarder was awesome The food was nice and the place itself if decked you with great machines
12066,4,New building New Kids working same old MickeyDs foodThey still have the same great coffee and thats why I go there
11996,4,Drivethru can be very slow Your better off to go in order on the kiosk then leave with your food if you dont want to dine in The food is comparable to other McDonalds franchises Ive been to
12000,4,Same as every other McDonalds
12002,4,Its one of the most techi mcdonalds out there  However it does occasionally take more than a few minutes to get your food in the drive through on a busy day  Youre better off to go in an order from the kiosk and sit at the tables  They all have flowers on them
12003,4,It was backed up after baseball and bcuz a bunch of electrical workers came in off of 87 But after just a few minutes wait the drive thru started working very rapidly
5371,4,Food was good and the place was very clean Just need more room in dinning area
12015,4,This place doesnt serve McLobster roll anymore  We used to go there twice a summer for their lobster roll  I gave a 4 stars became of the interior quality
12024,4,Fast service very clean great stop at the border
5261,4,Got two FiletOFish sandwiches  Both were good as expected  I ordered through the McDonalds app and opted to pickup my sandwiches at the drive thru  I told the employee at the speaker that I had an app order to pickup and gave her the code  She instructed me to go to the first window  There I was given the receipt thanked and told to go to the next window  At the 2nd window I was told to go to a 3rd window to pickup the order  The 3rd window is kind of funny since it seems like an afterthought  Since it is at the corner of the building close to a sign it is difficult to get close enough to be handed the order without scraping the side of your car Then to leave you have to turn your wheels hard right  The employees were very friendly
5363,4,Just your average Macdonalds the service was good and the place was clean
5355,4,After leaving the Balboa shopping center I grabbed a Big Mac a few times They have the 2 lane thing going on Thats a plus
12036,4,Well decorated typical micky ds
5348,4,I dont know why but I love their cheeseburgers something about the flavor of the meat that I really like I got 2 Mcdoubles and 6 chicken Mcnuggets for 5 bucks its a good snack for a cheap price
5345,4,Definitely a super busy drivethrough between the hours of 7 and 830 my order was taken accurately food was hot and it seemed like it was fresh no issues
12053,4,This McDonalds location could be cleaner They need to may attention to the SelfServe station a tad more Otherwise typical McDonalds experience
5339,4,Love the pricing and unique item offerings
5330,4,This McDonalds has probably been remodeled two or three times The interior is TINY Like REALLY TINY If youre here hunting happy meal toys they charge you 2 for the toy some places will charge only 1 You can use the McDonalds app here but beware the tricky mobile app order and pay Mobile is a pain to use theyre not always able to know where your order is and it takes way longer to order on your phone or at a kiosk than it does in person Drivethrough doesnt get too bad because theres tons of food options nearby
12033,4,Its no longer a cheap meal ours usually for two people cost around 20 bucks but the coffee is good and we know that the food is always to a certain standard which is very important when were traveling on the highway and we dont know the restaurants
5174,4,Good 
12118,4,Very fastpaced drivethru and fresh food
5260,4,The service was excellent even at all hours very hard worker and very clean for the amount of traffic flow My experiences here have been memorable Keep up the amazing work McDonalds
5198,4,Good 
12216,4,Good
5194,4,Good 
12223,4,McDonalds is the only one in town that consistently makes it up when they mess up LOL
12225,4,Good food at reasonable prices
5190,4,Good 
12230,4,The service was ok it wasnt bad
5187,4,Good

12238,4,Brand new McDonalds latest technology and super clean
5182,4,Good 
12241,4,Leg stretch potty break and desert stop
5180,4,Good 
12245,4,Good but a bit slow
12203,4,Very Busy but the staff was efficient and friendly
12202,4,Right off the interstate free wifi and a drive thru too usual Mcd fare
5210,4,Good 
5220,4,Good 
12123,4,Got breakfast here  they have truck parking
5253,4,The staff is not good Rude Didnt even heaitate to take my order I was trying the screen when The manager came and took another persons order and then i gone to him and had the order taken He was helpful and in 2 mn my order was ready Had some beggars on premises asking for money Was not busy Had lots of free seats
5248,4,Good 
5244,4,Good 
12138,4,ok for a McDo service was good but you guys need to have vinegar
12146,4,Very clean restaurant with nice customer service
12153,4,All Im gonna say is check your order before you leave the restaurant
12120,4,Clean always crowded Staff is nice   serve you with courtesy
12156,4,They hussled and seemed to work hard
5236,4,Good

5226,4,Good 
12185,4,Food is a hater Miss but usually is good
12189,4,Fast service
12163,4,Conveniently located near the border Clean Fresh food and fast service
11262,4,Love the sausage egg and cheese McGriddle 
11260,4,The drivethru line at this location is had been and will always be broken Dont ask me why because i do not know Maybe it is because the 3rd window is rarely used Idk but go inside if you have a small order as its faster to go to a register Check your order when they are super busy as they give you a diet or another order on occasion Otherwise my favorite place to get a large coke for 1
5667,4,Good 
6082,4,This location always has a crowd so I gave 4 stars however they are extremely fast in service So if youre running late into the office this is the place to stop
6080,4,Its a McDonalds you get what you expect from here every time As a place for very fast cheap and consistent food its good
10234,4,They was nice but no more 100 food on the menu I was not very happy about this with me living on a goverment check so I dont have to much money when I was told that they stoped the dollar menu so with me not having to much money I got some thing to eat no I wouldnt go back to no McDonalds because of no more dollar menu I will be going to like Burger King they have a dollar menu or Jack In The Box the meal are a lot cheaper than McDonalds I think they lost their minds not having the dollar menu no more other than that they was very nice because Im in a power wheelchair
10235,4,Ive never actually gone inside this location but I use the drive thru fairly regularly Its a pretty busy spot but even before they put in the duallane ordering system the service was always quick
10242,4,Had the mcdonalds egg sausage cheese meal along with my girlfriend for a quick breakfast before heading home from LA to San jose it hit the spot since i was in a hurry
10243,4,They order for you on the touch screen if theyre busy The only McDonalds I tried where their hash brown didnt come out hot and fresh Very disappointed and will not order breakfast at this location
10247,4,They cool no handle picking up from they me
10249,4,Stopped for a quick meal in between bus stops  They provided quick service and thankfully no errors on the food order  Appreciated that the diner was relatively clean
6073,4,Food was fast fresh and hot Place was clean with rapid service
10250,4,I tried curbside delivery using the McDonalds app and it worked The only problem is that there are only 2 delivery spots and regular eatin customers park in them That defeats the purpose Inside the place was clean and there are 2 selfservice ordering kiosks
10253,4,Great service The only reason it is 4 and not 5 ia because of the homeless people who are never satisfied If you give them a dollar they ask for another one If no money is available then they ask for cigs If no cigs are available they ask for food last Im getting tired of it
6072,4,Just happy to find a place to get something quick to eat
6070,4,on a messy knockoff block
6066,4,Fast service and ok food but no where to sit due to bums laying in the booths upstairs Maybe get some employees to check up there occasionally
6061,4,One of the cashiers were nice because there was no line ordering food was like chatting
6083,4,For a mcdonalds in an extremely busy area  I think the staff were doing a great job keeping everything moving  The area was clean enough and I am particular about that the kiosks were in working order besides one but it didnt hold up the orders at all  Food deals were clearly marked  the ordering system wasnt correct as you usually grab a tent and go to a table but one of the staff saw us wondering about it and told us to just put a number in so they were clearly attentive to what was going on around them  Food came out quickly  Same cost for food as any other mcdonalds anywhere  Great quick  cheap food for a late evening
10224,4,"Fast customer service
Manager is friendly They treat homeless with equal respect Thumbs up for that Fries were not as good as I expected Thats why I give 4 points"
10214,4,Everything went quickly done was well
6093,4,Dirty table but there are empty seats to eat in The atmosphere is not bad for McDonalds Their app doesnt have good deals anymore
10139,4,The food was fresh it was surprisingly clean very friendly
10140,4,"Usually are pretty good Except my last visit I had ordered a box of cookies They messed up and gave me a bag which had 3 cookies in it

I emailed them and they still haven"
6117,4,Why a 1
10148,4,Good customer service fast service and very patient
10150,4,The difference in taste of the meat from the Big Mac to the quarter pounder was astronomical Like it didnt even come from the same type of animal So will not be doing the Big Mac again They were fast and they were friendly but still McDonalds
10168,4,Its not your typical McDonalds Theyre over price on their menu plus they do not accept coupon or does any special like regular McDonalds I think they feel the need to make their money from the Disneyland patron and its ridiculous toward the regular customers but its all boil down to make money Sometimes they can be rude toward the black customer but what to expect from seeing who goes into this franchise Most of the customer that goes into this store are traveller which is mostly Caucasian
10176,4,If you are visiting this particular McDonalds youll notice that you are very nearly in the middle of the strange nomans or womans land encompassing skid row and the new upwardly trendy lofts and shops that seek to define Download Los Angeles This McDonalds manages to straddle this uncomfortable melange quite nicely The inside of the restaurant was bright and clean The counters looked new and the menu sign actually was orderly laid out with sensible photos next to the main items I dont eat fast food often and the overhead menus always confuse me with super this and extra large that I know that I am not getting the best price  ever But this menu seemed far simpler we ordered and our food was served quickly with my special request done just right We ate in and the table was clean as was the floor Its true we were approached twice by people asking for money but they were not intrusive and I had the feeling the manager and staff were well aware of who was in the restaurant and I didnt feel uncomfortable at all The staff was so attentive that for the first time I actually filled out the online survey just to compliment them Thats quite a compliment in itself coming from me
10285,4,"Holy wow The lattes here are super delicious

Spanish latte  creamy but not milky latte with a hint of cinnamon that isnt overpowering

Lavender matcha latte  strong matcha flavor that compliments the lavender Its not milky at all I really like floral matcha"
10177,4,Its a nice place I have not dined in But even when the line looks long during the morning I can honestly say that they provide a faster service to get you out ASAP
6107,4,This location has a young crowd on the weekend  They play good music while you drink frappe and have a big mac

10203,4,Ver small dinning area most orders to go many people who are traveling by greyhound go for last meal before leaving town
10206,4,It was great other than the soda options werent the best not much to choose from should definitely have root beer as an option I think they should get the new touch screen soda dispenser there that had plenty of soda options to choose from would be very nice
10184,4,The food at this location is usually hot and fresh Services usually quick Today however my breakfast sandwich had a lot of egg shells in it That doesnt usually happen but you still have to be careful nonetheless

10299,4,Service is good and it was finally remodeled Its right near the grayhound bus station With the area on its way to transformation as well as the arts district right there none of these artsy restaurants can replace Mc Donalds ever  
6057,4,Not cleanest
6053,4,I went late at night and they were out of a few things Nothing I was trying to order thoughquick and efficient Be wary that NYC doesnt have deals on the McDonalds app like other cities do
10303,4,Love the morning staff they always make me feel good when I pull up for my morning coffee and est great job team

6248,4,Istopped in at this location at 3 am on Sun morning it was super busy and understaffed Surprisingly however  the overwhelmed staff was super nice Even through the place was crowed it didnt take long to get a customized order The bathroom was understandably a mess

9959,4,Good 
6240,4,Fast service but while I was there on vacation staying accross the street the service was a bit harsh
6237,4,Food was good Time to serve was fast enough and though as a first timer I never knew how to make orders via the machine Lol am just a new arrival from Africa we are use to human Services not computers Lol It was a good time overall
6229,4,McDs is a good place to eat fairly cheaply The wait time for your food DOES vary from restaurant to restaurant though Sometimes great  sometimes terrible The food quality seems to be the same from restaurant to restaurant I love their sweet tea regular cheeseburger and their fantastic fries I would recommend it to people looking for a decent meal at a reasonable price
9935,4,Good 
9933,4,Good 
6254,4,Id expect a McDonalds near Penn Station to be pretty terrible but theyve actually kept this location reasonably nice It

9882,4,Good
9883,4,Good 
6343,4,The foods pretty good But you have to pay to use the restroom But the foods awsome and the ice cream machine works
6331,4,Often busy because of the high flow of traffic in the area but as far as a McDonalds goes it is not bad Service is quick prices are good food is consistent for the most part
9890,4,Good 
6319,4,Quick clean efficient social distanced order delivery pick up system excellent job and the food was fresh
9966,4,Good 
9901,4,One more McDonalds
6309,4,Unfortunately the covid19 pandemic has rendered eating within mcdonalds not possible it a rather elegant one Clean composed every bit the lady and her  staff are professional  Fast food done right  Money  low from all the shopping and touring take swin
9908,4,Good 
6288,4,If you are passing through and need a place to eat or you dont have time to put dinner on the table usually this is youre next option But before going anywhere else to eat come here first If you are looking for people who still care about there job in this day in age and are dedicated to making there service the best it can possibly be this is where you should go
6282,4,Its a big space its a bit allover the place when it comes to management and foot traffic some go to this mcds with the intention of hanging out The service is a hit and miss and at times the place can be a bit dirty but the prices r decent for the area
9914,4,Good 
6277,4,I read the reviews and they were unkind but it was conveniently located Also 100 coffee  They have security to keep out the undesirables Weird to see 2 security guards at McDonalds but I guess it is working The place was clean and being able to order at a kiosk made the wait time short even during the breakfast rush
9918,4,Good 
9902,4,Good 
10129,4,Good fast and great workers But sketchy people around due to the greyhound and local bums But they do have top flight security around so all around ok
6228,4,I didnt have a mask cause it suddenly broke while on line and the cashier offered me a mask I thought that was so awesome i was so happy causw they made me feel welcomed and not embrassed The staff was pleasant and quick serving
6219,4,Crazy busy and usually encompassed with 8th Ave nutters but the security keeps everyone in check  theyve always gotten my order right and regardless how busy they always manage to get orders out pretty darn quick ghettoefficiency
10021,4,Good 
6169,4,Your typical McDonalds Which is generally why people visit McDonalds all around the world Consistency Could be a little cleaner But nothing that would turn one off Reasonable experience Reasonable service With expected pricing
10025,4,Good 
6167,4,Staff is nice and they are fast to get the food out I only go in the morning for breakfast on the way to work Only issues are the norm in many places they dont clean the kiosks often and they are no wipes to do it yourself and have to be careful of people crowded by the doors
10026,4,Good 
10027,4,Good 
6165,4,"PROS This McDonalds is located right next to Madison Square garden making it an easy stop right before or after the game They are also very clean and the staff seemed to be nice The food came fast compared to other fast food places in the city

CONS The touchscreens that you order your food on had a tough time scanning the vaccine card and the place was small inside compared to other fast food places

OVERALL Great place near the garden but isnt my goto when I hit that area of the city"
10068,4,"A cool little get away spot in the city when you need that FREE WIFI and also 1 coffee  I love it  The staff are not too welcoming but they are in the center of traffic with people shopping and across the street from Madison Square GardenBut I still like the location  Check it out

Eat Play Shop
Live Life Unscripted"
10070,4,The McDonalds took a while to get our service as it was a bit slow however once we recieved it the food was tasty The decor and surroundings provided a pretty good atmosphere I would recommend a stop by for sure get some classic maccas in ya
6151,4,We went in the evening on our way back to the hotel from a trip to the Liberty Island We were really hungry so we ordered lots of stuff The food and drinks were good The place has lots of seating space and you can order on the selfhelp kiosks It seemed like the restrooms were not open as there was a gate towards its entrance but we didnt care because our hotel was nearby
10083,4,Nice location at an upper floor inside Macys Good for tired famished shoppers Take the window seats and get a good view of New York below
6144,4,"I am a big fan of McDonalds I have tried it in more than 21 countries so how can I skip when I am in New York USA
Same taste different country"
6135,4,"Very up to date McDonalds Great customer service and fast service
This is the first fast food service spot that I got my food in less than 7 mins  Usually Im waiting 20 minutes"
10117,4,Typical McDonalds food service is ok not the worse to be in dtla atmosphere varies since the security takes care of business
6129,4,I wanted 2 barbecue sauce packets and they forgot to give me it
10020,4,Good 
6174,4,It is great thant you can actually eat inside the place no like many other restaurants in the area at the moment because of the omicron variant The bad thing its that the personal in these particular McDonalds is slow youre going to have to wait for your food at least 5 to 10 minutes It is the price you have to pay if you want to eat inside haha
10014,4,Good 
10012,4,Good 
9973,4,Good 
6216,4,I enjoy this mc Donalds however you cant use the bathroom without first showing the receipt 
9980,4,Good 
6209,4,Very clean decent bathroom   Lots of lost soles during the week hanging out  But they are kept low and behaved Bathroom is kept clean and decent and they have a wall of ordering terminals to is I do suggest using an app and having it ready rather then the touch screen They have a long delay and its a bit to order
6204,4,Its a decent McDonalds  The issue is its location  its  a high tourist area and hub for New Yorkers to do a lot of shopping or transferring bustrains That also comes with people who are on drugs homeless and so on But its not that bad
6203,4,Thank you guys for your job and the effort to keep the place at the nice level even sometimes becomes messy but you always were friedly and ready to prepare my food order  not the healthiest option tho  but you always saved me from starving
6201,4,Great service Clean Unfortunately they have seedy people that love hanging out on the side walk This is not Mc Donalds fault However I feel safe and satisfied with the pace of service
9969,4,Good 
9987,4,Good 
6200,4,Have to say they finally up the game recently  put security in the establishment to prevent certain unwanted people taking up seats early in the mng sleeping  leaving a mess That no longer currently exists as i have seen the change myself Dont hesitate to enter the establishment for breakfast 
6199,4,Very friendly staff The cashier right away greeted us and asked what we would like to order She was also very helpful explain the offers that were available Service was fast quick and extremely efficient Waiting time was less than 5 minutes Good fast food spot for a quick bite to eat They also offer order yourself service and of course on the app too Food was good The only reason I couldnt give this McDonalds a 5 stars was because many tables and chairs to eat in were a bit dirty Also the restrooms were dirty it could have been better other than that eatoutside and dont forget if you like my review please give it a thumbs up
9996,4,Good 
6185,4,Pretty clean place crowded of course but that can be overseen when you find a table Service is pretty speedy got my food pretty quickly Security by the bathroom though need your receipt just to use it Gets annoying hearing maam wait sir your receipt You need a receipt Tip dont throw away your receipt until you leave and dont sit next to the bathroom if you dont wanna hear that everytime a person tries to enter the bathroom
10006,4,Good 
6177,4,Not too busy everything was clean and service was good wait time wasn long even though their was a decent amount of customers And food was fresh as could be for fast food Also not one employee was rude Good visit and would recommend this one over some others in area

9988,4,Good 
5991,4,"I understand that its just fast food but I eat fast food frequently   Just lack the budget to indulge in sushi and other fine fare lol
Im also not a sushi person I love as six mc Donalds for their cheap juicy burger fast orders and cheap shakes or if Im feeling like I want something lighter ony stomach and its late a grilled chicken salad side asald or parfait is great Excellent for my son who asks for the yogurt in his kids meal The mozzarella sticks is also a perfect edition Their coffee exceeds bk and I loved this location wen visiting last month Quick easy and clean with upstairs seating The workers for friendly and helped me when they forgot a drink"

10751,4,The store was very busy and full of customers I didnt like the way they greet the customers and the way they talked to each individuals It was busy and that cant be an excuse for bad service Food was great as usual but service gotta improve by mile The cleanliness was an issue also as there were napkins pretty much all over the place I guess it was not cleaned since evening May be business is the priority which is not what Mc does I believe

5928,4," Happy  Thanksgiving 2019 

This McDonalds located at 262 Canal Street in Chinatown New York City have been here for ages

All McDonalds are created equal in terms of cleanliness so it is no surprise that it is very clean neat tidy and spotlessly clean

It is a huge McDonalds because it has 3 stories but on the second and third floor there is a limited number of chairs  Poor design left it with about 40 to 50 seats on the 2 top floors

The staff is very professional friendly and polite with a smile and there are staff who are bilingual English and Chinese English and Spanish

Enjoy  Mickey Ds  and

A Happy Thanksgiving"
5923,4,Is nice place they kipper clean up all the time good service
5921,4,No compliant  friendly customer service  and food was given in a timely  fashion
10546,4,Its Was in are budget yummy shakes are good
5914,4,Very friendly morning staff
5913,4,Good service but a lot of strange people entering the store People asking for money in aggressive way and the people in line ordering food looked concerned
5912,4,Its McDonalds You kinda know what to expect One thing you should be prepared for if youre not a native of Manhattan its very pricy I guess paying for the NY rent causes the prices to be higher than what we have in Texas The service was fast and organized despite being very busy just dont expect to get your usual meal for your usual price Happy travels
5899,4,Great family friendly entertaining teenage students too But The toilets are too horribly maintained Smelly No mirrors used Tissue were heaped openly Very non hygienic May be the management is too busy  short staffed  
5896,4,Stopped in just for an ice coffee Their ice coffee is solid overall  an awesome bargain 1 via app
10507,4,I went there at 500 in the morning when it was clean Only a few homeless were sleeping
5945,4,It was absolutely amazing I went around closing time and it was no waiting time to be seated and my server Ty  was amazing I had a great time and the drinks do it for me every time Hands own one of my favorite places to eat and drink
5948,4,"This review is on their bathroom and small fries for obvious reasons
So glad this place is 24hours I needed to use their bathroom so badly at 10pm I ordered a small fries and ran upstairsthere was toilet paper which is a huuuge plus but their mirrorI think someone stole it or something There is just hand soap on the wall and where the mirror should be were just screw holes LOL WELP"
10492,4,A little dirty but workers were nice and respectful
10416,4,Food took awhile to come out Also very few tables available due lots of people having coffee at a 4 person table
10435,4,Good and fast service with plenty of space inside Only disadvantage  in the afternoon can be a little too warm inside
10438,4,Packed like crazy around brunch time But excellent service and nice people
5977,4,"Great coffee on a weekday

Coffee on a Saturdays not so much"
10457,4,Like every other McDonalds I have been to this one as well kept is usually trash free and I do not mind coming here all anytime
10459,4,Decent inside but parking is sparse and took awhile for a spot to open up
10461,4,Caramel iced macchiato are really good but coffee not to strong
5895,4,Too crowded but they were managing it wellbathrooms were too dirty 
5970,4,"Have a couple kiosks in the front  easy and nice to use Lots of customizable things to the order Make sure you scroll to the bottom and check out the deals and promotions Order was prepared pretty quickly and correct No big complaints about as good an experience that McDonalds can be

Pro tip on the kiosk when you are checking out and it asks for your location code Just click cancel Its an error in the system"

5823,4,"After exploring Chinatown in lower Manhattan I decided to walk to the only McDonalds in the immediate area on the south side of Canal Street It didnt look like much from the outside but once I entered I walked up to the counter to order one coffee which took a few minutes since the place was somewhat busy and there was a customer in line in front of me

I got my order and walked upstairs to the first level and sat at a comfortable booth Within a few minutes a manager came to my table to ask if everything was OK and I told him Yes but I was having trouble to connect to the free WiFi He immediately helped me with this and although the connection was slow I was pleased that the problem was solved

Then the manager chatted with me and asked if I would mind doing a survey and I filled out the online survey Then he said I was entitled to a free burger so I had a Big Mac

I think this is a very well managed place and will definitely return when I am back in Manhattan in the Chinatown area"

Only went there twice The food is never fresh  Chicken sandwich was shriveled and dry like it had been sitting for hours after being over cooked to begin with There was a small drop of mayo on it and the bun was stale First time I figured was a one off but the second time I ordered 20 nuggets and fries and a milkshake  They didnt give a receipt then told me to go park to wait for the food to be ready  There were no spots open that I could access and the cashier just said do whatever and walked away  I waited for the car in front of me to move so I could pull around the building and get into a spot but asked first about my shake  She said theyll bring it  Waited a few min honestly not long but then they forgot my milkshake and asked me very curtly well do you have a receipt  clearly not  Eventually they brought out the shake but fries were old and cold and the shake was melted"

1833,4,"Our visit was on Friday 5122023 There is a marked improvement in the service and cleanliness at this location on Ft Hamilton Parkway Katherine the Manager and her staff Chris promptly offered help and solutions to my familys needs The use of a dedicated staff member to continuously clean the dining area was a big plus I only feel that the beverage station should be closer to the dining area to facilitate the transfer of drinks from station to table particularly for the disabled
Another concern was the price of the food Though there were dollar options available the price of the more popular sizes and items was very high A medianincome family of four would be wary of dining more than once a month if that often
The name of the counter person that helped us during our visit was Chris He is a credit to the McDonalds company"

1874,4,Easy to pick up my mobile orders They have soda machines so you dont have to worry about specifying no ice in drinks They include napkins straw and lids Straws have either been paper or plastic They do not include ketchup packets so you have to ask counterstaff 1 drinks is a perk that no other fast food restaurant has The dining room has plentiful tables and chairs too ranging from booths to high stools to couchlike chairs Easy to get there by Q25 or Q34 Not very close to any subway stations

1893,4,Best mcdonalds in the area but for some reason they charge a few cents more Not a big deal but just something I noticed The staff makes fries fresh forreal lol upon request Nuggs are Hit or miss But burgers are pretty good Not a fan of the chicken products from here but the other mcodnalds on 86th and 20 has good chicken

18887,4,Good 
17279,4,To be clear the rating of 4 stars is perhaps generous I debated between 3 and 4 stars but I ate at this McDonalds pretty late so Ill assume the staff was just tired and ready to go home The place was fairly clean and service wasnt terrible but it wasnt stellar either They originally forgot the cookies my friend ordered and when they did get them for him the didnt have all 3 chocolate chip so they gave him 2 of those and 1 sugar cookie I understand that but rather than just telling him Hey we got you 2 of those and 1 of these they should have asked Since we only have 2 chocolate chip can we give you those and 1 sugar cookie Thats just polite Also the ketchup was out even though they clearly werent busy All this being said they took the order quickly apart from that were friendly enough and got the food out fast without any mistakes apart from that If Im in the area I might stop by but the McDonalds in Marlton is much better

Update Oct 2019 Last three times Ive been my Quarter Pounder bun has been stale and the never frozen patty was overdone and served way too fast to be cookedtoorder  Disappointed that their quality is going downhill  The neverfrozen 14 pound patties are worlds better than the frozen ones when theyre cooked properly"

18618,4,Fast service
879,4,"This is our hometown MCdonalds and between the wife grandchildren and I we are here twice a week  Like review I did on the Hamlin MCDonalds I call this the older style and its been ainted over the years and they removed the small playyard it had  People now are a afraid of ballpits and it was outside so it didnt get used over 6 months of the year

There is ample seating but Ive seen more with more seating but weve never been without finding a seat  Everything is pretty clean and in good order Walkin orders are accurate and fast  Drive in is fast and about 8 times out of 10 they will have it exact  Some times they get it wrong but like we say nobodys perfect

Since its right on Rt209 its easy to get in and out of unless your traveling South on 209 then sometimes its hard to pull out because theres KFC and Subway and an Ice Cream shop across the street so its a busy little area in Brodheadsville  Overall its a nice facility"
884,4,"Wind Gap PA location was surprisingly better during COVID 19 because with the interior closed the drive up was fast and serving fresh food
The streamlined way allows  serving just the drive up and so the kitchen staff cooks food for just one area Probably saves on staff hours
Just crave those FRIES once in awhile"

1974,4,"TLDR You can get the BTS meal here  two sauces and special bag included

Never thought Id be writing a review for a McDonalds yet here we are Was disappointed to hear that the purple packaging isnt available in the US Corporate missed opportunity Hesitant because the paper bag adorned with the BTS logo was not guaranteed to be available at all locations Fears were quelled as I saw other guests sitting outside and the elusive BTS paper bag going for 70 on eBay was elusive no longer Utilized the selfservice machines to order  quick and easy Medium and large sizes available opted for medium which was more than enough food in hindsight Liked the Cajun sauce more than the Sweet Chili sauce but just a personal preference Total of the medium BTS meal was 839  074 tax  913 Food was nothing special just happy to support the boys

As always please be kind to food service workers

18182,4,Good service but one the staff in the kitchen is way too loud and wouldn
59,4,OPEN 24HRS all the darn time  If there are 24 hours in every day and then 7 days in a week then that means this place is open eleventeen million hours a year  I dont even know how they find people to work here I mean how do they shower or brush their teeth or change clothes if they are always there I think I may have an idea they are robots  Or clones like this example thats Dolly the sheep shes pretty hot NGL

16727,4,Always fast friendly service 
81,4,I would have given 5 stars the evening manager is the nicest person I have seen and is definitely in charge of training her crew with constantly new help in spite of this everytime I have to return an order she goes back to the kitchen and patiently disassembles the sandwich and explains the proper way to make the sandwich in a spirit of education and with a cherry disposition You can tell the children she works with respect her and look up to her and yes they might get things confused occasionally but I will continue to go there 4 out of 5 stars

1257,4,It was good
18208,4,This location has a fun indoor playroom area The play equipment always seems to be clean and wellmaintained I take my twoyearold granddaughter there occasionally and she always has fun The only reason for the four out of five stars is because their projection screeninteractive play mat has not worked properly since we have been visiting there over the last year It has partially worked on a couple of occasions and my granddaughter remembers that she enjoyed it Every time were there she stomps on it to try to make it work She will grab my hand and pull me over to the mat and try and get me to make it work I

17,4,The line wS extremely big and was moving very slowly plus they were out of apple pies and strawberry cream pies but they gave me substitute cinnabun the staff was very apologetic for being slow  they were out of pies but it was middle of the night and they were extremely understaffed

796,5,Excellent 
5340,5,"I happen to love Tommys but it definitely is not everyones cup of tea Their chili burger is their traditional specialty It has meat chili tomato onions and pickle The chili seems greasy but I love it

Tommys is an acquired taste Ive been going to the original tommys since 1968 in Los Angeles at Beverly and rampart That shack is open twentyfour hours a day and you basically eat outside putting your food on a ledge and standing to eat it

This Tommys is a more traditional restaurant where are you give your order inside pick it up and sit down in comfort

I love that the fries are large because they hold the heat much longer than small fries

I used to order extra chili with my hamburger and it made things very messy What I learned at this visit was to have the chili put on the side so I could add it as I wanted

there are many different types and flavors to chili This was brought home to me one time when I was at the original Tommys and picked up my burger and drink right after a couple They ended up eating nearby and I heard the mail of the couple exclaim Thats not good chili

I was wondering what part of the Southwest he was from because of his critique I just about choked on my drink when I heard him say If you want good chili you need to come to New York

Im sure that there are good places to get chili in New York but that guy was probably one of the people that considers everything west of the Hudson River to be a dining desert"

Pros any location Im at from Shenzhen China to Hawaii to Orlando I can count on McDonalds when I land They keep the same consistent taste world wide as a business owner this is admirable This location was efficient and fast

Cons we all know its not the healthiest food but that had nothing to do with the location
So I only ate it once on my 5 day stay
McDonalds should explore healthier options for the current market  But still a great experience

2922,5,Excellent 
31643,5,This was one of my best visit the service was super  good
2995,5,Employees were friendly and courteous Quick service and food was fresh
3064,5,I like that there were 3 levels to this McDonalds  They also have a security guard that you have to show your receipt to to get upstairs  That should keep alot of people out that are just hanging out using seats and not eating The food was typical of most McDonalds
31116,5,Excellent 
31117,5,"This location is near the city Zoo It is beautifully themed with majestic animals We enjoyed that they made the interior a learning environment The service was good too which was very refreshing

This location features a play area as well Our orders were correct That is miraculous considering the multiple errors we normally see when placing fast food orders We felt welcomed "
3063,5,Shamrock shakes are the best Why cant they serve them all year The vanilla soft serve cones are great too and a really good price The yummiest thing is to dip your French fries in your shake Ive been coming to McDonalds since I was a kid and its still as good and Im still as excited to go there as always Thank you for staying the same
3060,5,With this MacDonalds you get your food faster from actually ordering at the register with a person vs using the kiosk
3054,5,"Say what you want about McDonalds but this location has it figured out I really hate that I forgot to take pictures for you guys but go here They have order kiosks and you can have your food brought to you by one of the staff
Something that doesnt happen often with McDonalds but this location really was clean There was a modern aesthetic to it along with the pastries never seen at anothr McDonalds
The food did take a while but considering the wait volume 2030 people I can understand
Overall this is a great place for cheap food to go and to stay If youre not specific about the way you like your food order at the kiosk get a table marker and go on upstairs and find yourself a table"
2431,5,Good food great service
31121,5,Since it reopened I go for breakfast about once a week Literally have never had a better hashbrown at any McDonalds anywhere in the country  its so perfectly crispy every time My order has always been correct The staff is super friendly and the wait is never long
3053,5,It wasnt busy I was attended to quick Food was good
3052,5,Got here in the wee hours and found this place very  clean quiet and the staff was courteous I ordered breakfast and asked for it to be fresh and hot Glad it was made to order palatable and hot  I loved being there on W 34th St Manhattan
3050,5,Wanted a nice quiet breakfast there was a giant inflatable rat right out the window 1010
3043,5,I would definitely recommend the McDonalds Application because you get your coffee 
31126,5,We had a small birthday party for my 4 year old at the play place and they were more than accomadating The area was clean and a worker came and helped us clean up after the fact without prompting Super nice of them
31667,5,You get exactly what you expect Had a McDoublewas perfect
3041,5,The restaurant was very clean and the ordering experience matched my expectations My order was ready in minutes and was exactly how I ordered it
2426,5,247 great service
3038,5,I did my order through the phone probably waited like 5 or 10 minutes mostly my fault for making the order as I was walking in so I understand the wait Everything was there which I greatly appreciate
31672,5,Probably the best McDonalds in dallas but beware of the line when coming here
3070,5,Known food at good price Clean areas Not crowded
31678,5,Great location friendly staff fast service
3092,5,amazing heavenly like it always is i ate on the third floor with my family and it was very tasty loved it a lot
31100,5,Excellent 
3088,5,I dont know if Im like from the 20th century but this McDonalds is super hightech This McDonald consists of three floors The main floor is what you walk on to its the second floor Most of the seating is on the third floor I didnt go up to it just because I had an ankle problem and unfortunately the elevator was out The basement and area you cant get to it is where the girl is it so fancy contrapment takes your food from the grill to the second floor where you order I just thought that was cool while I was waiting around for my food They have about six selfserving machines that are in front of the restaurant But if you want to speak to a human you can just walk past that to the two registers they have
31676,5,The servers were exceptionally friendly and helpful
3078,5,As far as a McDonalds goes it gets 5 stars for being clean and having quick service as well as surprisingly adequate seating I have not given this location a rating based upon my opinion of McDonalds in general
31104,5,Excellent 
2419,5,absolutely delightful amazing lifechanging
2424,5,I like McDonalds is very nice
31106,5,Excellent

31113,5,Excellent 
2994,5,Busy so busy its hard to know when your foods ready if tour not standing up there the whole time But is across from Pen Station given the area and associated expectations of large crowds of people  service was good
31665,5,Probably the coolest McDonalds in the world Really cool to eat and be surrounded by animals and the sounds of the forest
31663,5,Always busy but it moves fast good food
31153,5,The man that takes the order is great he been there for 1012 years Hes great
31652,5,Good place to bring your kids
31154,5,I went inside with my kids and being that its next to the zoo the inside decor is made to look like were at the zoo My kids loved sitting at the table while we waited for our food  The employees were friendly and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time The restrooms were clean as well  I recommend it 
3006,5,Its fast food what can I say
3005,5,Hot fresh food definitely recommend 34th 7ave McDonalds 
3004,5,people who take the time to review mcdonalds and give negative reviews need to get a life
31651,5,Great Mcgriddle hot coffee and a crispy hashbrown
2451,5,Love getting my iced coffee here
31648,5,Just love they ice tea It just right
31158,5,Its a McDonalds with a Zoo twist If you are reading this review you likely already know how the food tastes and what is on the menu The key difference here is the great animal decorations on the outside More importantly though is how efficient this location is Every time Ive been through Ive seen a drive through 10 cars deep and watched them churn through everyones orders in a matter of minutes If only every drive through was this efficient
31159,5,I am changing my review from 1 star to 5 stars after my recent two visits Mar 2023 This McDonalds has gone through a major overhaul Newly remodeled inside and out including employees  Employees are very polite and welcoming even asked how my day was going and talked about the weather 
3003,5,Great service and very clean Staff is working hard Enjoyed the visit
3000,5,It was good There was a mistake on my order it was fixed no problem The machines were having some problems and this made the lines a little long But it was fine
2999,5,This McDonalds is pretty okay but at night junkies tend to wander around this area Obviously not the restaurants fault though its worth noting I always do app orders and havent had any issues in the past year or however long The wait seems normal to me I definitely prefer this location to the larger one on 8th Ave
2455,5,Speedy service whenever I visit
2446,5,This place is great for kids to play when the weather is  not great
31132,5,Loved this placekids area was greatit was nice and cold insidegreat after a hot day at the zooand food was ready fast even with our big order
3011,5,"Staff is very quick efficient and friendly here never had an incorrect order before

Side note  Im not sure of his name but thank you thank you thank you so much to the security guard that works here for returning my phone to me after it was just stolen along with everything else in my bag Went that extra bit that is much more rarely seen these days and getting that phone back meant so much more than he couldve ever known so once again  THANK YOUUUUUU "
3014,5,Did you know McDonalds has a special relationship with Coke and they have the freshest crispest tastiest Coke you can buy anywhere  Try it and youll see what I go just for Coke sometimes All soda sizes are 100 right now
2441,5,Service is quick  fries are fresh
31134,5,Hey yo got that buy one get one for a buck My 10 piece nuggets almost gone Bru  Taking this Big Mac for a buck home Bru hahahahaha Psichopathicpeppamintpimpin
2443,5,They have stepped up their efforts in iced coffee
3032,5,Not bad 
31136,5,Fantastic theme which is inspired by Dallas zoo and compliments the same   Spacious and also have a great kids play area  Crew are good must visit when visiting the near by zoo   Kids will love it  A refreshing unique look than other mc Donald

3021,5,Impressed with the service during breakfast time When they brought the food to my table I didnt have to ask for anything Napkins jelly butter ketchup hot cake syrup silverware granola for the yogurt everything was on point and fresh Excellent
31655,5,The new Snickerdoodle McFlurry is great Regular McDonalds fare
3019,5,Busy but still giving outstanding service
31145,5,I think Ive always loved McDonalds and I really like what they have with the vanilla milkshake and I get to Becky McDonalds and sometimes in order of tater tots real good place real good food
3018,5,Its just like them all but better they have a large turnover so everything was fresh hot and tasty very quick and very clean upstairs was pleasantly surprised

30299,5,So I never thought I would be reviewing a McDonalds  because well its McDonalds  However I was in town for a conference and grabbed a quick lunch in between sessions  The food was typical McDs but every staff member was just so friendly and helpful  Granted I dont eat at inside McDs often but I have never been so delighted and cared for ar one  Greeted as I walked in ordered from kiosks food delivered to me staff member checked on how my food was and wished well by members as I left  McDs needs to bottle up the service from this location and send to all  Cheers
1857,5,Is this close to a school Lots of noisy teenagers hanging around here Other than that it has an interesting seating arrangement Just come at a slower time if you plan to enjoy your mealsnack dining in I do notice the regular pricing is higher than nearby McDonalds There is lots of curbside pickup parking drive thru often busy Ask for ketchup and sauce they never give it by default

32231,5,For the first time I see such a McDonalds made either under Madagascar or just like the Jungle The lion growls the elephant trumpets periodically the boa constrictor hisses the children like it But there is no selforder screen Civilization apparently has not yet reached this forest with animals

4611,5,Great service 
29947,5,Had a pleasant trip here with my 5 year old On vacation from Indiana and compared to any McDonalds there this is like a fine dining restaurant lol clean food was fresh tomatoes where not mushy which brings me to believe they actually dont freeze theres like back at home Had two managers walking around the restaurant actually working instead of being in the backroom doing paperwork five stars definitely will be returning before we go back home
32208,5,Excellent 
29950,5,"My family and I stopped in here for a quick breakfast on our way home from a mini vacation

I ordered the oatmeal and a hash brown

An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table I noticed I didnt have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed

I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasnt on the tray either
I let her know and she apologized then comes back with not one but 2 hash browns which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now She comped a free hashbrown
She was such a pleasant person to deal with  Her customer service and customer care abilities are 2010

I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isnt her usual location and she is a General Manager

She took care of evryone around us with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face which is a rare occasion

I hope she gets the recognition she deserves and a promotion or raise She turned a typically frustrating situation and made it a pleasant one Its funny to think that I we left happy even though our order was messed up"

29857,5,We visited this while on a vacation to Orlando with our team What an experience Theres a lot of different food options including PIZZA The place is amazing If you are ever in or near the Orlando area it is absolutely worth the time to stop in and see this place Unbelievable
29858,5,Great Mcdonalds Really love the clean store the big mac is delicious and so are the breakfast items and chicken nuggets The convention is right here so there are a lot of tourists but they have a self serve kiosk that helps to speed up taking orders Highly recommend this store if youre in the area The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive the road is pretty interesting at times In conclusion I rate this McDonalds 55 and I hope to be back soon to take out more food to do mukbangs
32262,5,Restaurant was clean Ordering at a kiosk was pretty impersonal but the cashier was nice I didnt like my breakfast choice  it looked like an english muffin with sausage But the muffin was very soft and tasted like syrup Yuck My sweet tea was weak at best However everyone else with me enjoyed their meal Bathroom was clean too

30023,5,Updated review 2022 This really is a great McDonalds Maybe if you dont appreciate it you havent been around The grounds are clean I saw the manager Chris picking up trash around the store They wear nice uniforms and there was an employee cleaning tables as soon as they were vacant A very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders TO THE TABLE yall It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby I think service is pretty fast 2019 Review I went here three times during my stay in the area and the food was always hot place clean and staff prompt and courteous Got a fabulous greeting Memorial Day morning

22155,5,"A Culinary Ode to McDonalds The Epitome of Delicious and Affordable Dining

Never cease to amaze us with your consistently appetizing offerings and your unwavering commitment to providing mouthwatering meals at unbeatable prices A true beacon of fastfood excellence McDonalds has reigned supreme for generations and its legendary menu items have captured the hearts and taste buds of millions around the world

One of the crowning jewels of McDonalds their nuggets are nothing short of extraordinary With a golden crispy exterior and tender juicy interior these delectable nuggets are the epitome of culinary perfection They are seasoned to perfection giving each bite a harmonious blend of savory and flavorful goodness Its no wonder that these little bites of heaven have become a staple in fast food history

And let us not forget the pice de rsistance that is the Quarter Pounderlds dedication to providing affordable highquality dining experiences for all Each bite of the Quarter Pounder boasts a succulent juicy patty cooked to perfection smothered in a tantalizing blend of cheese and crispy bacon The mouthwatering aroma alone is enough to send my senses into overdrive

Paired with a generous serving of their worldfamous fries and a refreshing beverage the Quarter Pounder with Cheese  Bacon meal is a steal at just 899 Its no exaggeration to say that McDonalds is making a significant charitable contribution to society by providing these scrumptious meals at such affordable prices They are not just satisfying our hunger but also nourishing our souls with the joy and comfort that only their delicious food can bring

So to McDonalds we raise our glasses and our nuggets in praise and admiration Thank you for your unwavering dedication to quality affordabilitynd the countless memories youve helped create around shared meals and moments of pure palatepleasing bliss"

22346,5,"Had an interview with the manager Barbra the experience was phenomenal from the moment I walked in the atmosphere of the room was very light and forgiving With tourist busily and undecidedly wandering about and workers happily and busily taking orders and cleaning common areas I learned a lot about McDonalds as a company They have so many opportunities for their employees I was truly blown away
By how amazing it could potentially be for me to work under a fast food restaurant that gets so much backlash from media and my own friends Five stars for me "
16221,5,Excellent

16368,5,2 lanes moves super fast
22261,5,Situated right in front of the Kuhio beach at a street corner with inside and outside tables it is a good place to order your morning breakfast at a quality you know and a price you like from McDonald

22263,5,Cheap and cheerful and with a good view In expensive places like this Im grateful for McDonalds keeping it simple
16366,5,Good coffee excellent food nice people

16359,5,"Paid a visit to see the unique architecture Inside was small but very clean They accepted my coupon and my order was brought to my table quickly No complaints with my food but it seemed like someone was having trouble with an Uber Eats order

My cashier was scolded by the manger for being too cold or rude to some coworkers he kept repeating treat everyone like an equal"
22267,5,Usually fast service and accurate on my orders Very busy and long line from 7am10am On the mountain side of The streetstrip on Waikiki Beach so it
16354,5,First time back since it was remodeled The girl in the drive thru was great Very friendly and personable
22270,5,A visitor from Australia and McDonalds worker it was amazing service was quick the restaurant was clean the food quality was great I will 100 be coming back before I go home
22271,5,Had breakfast here twice while staying close by Very busy location but got through pretty quickly considering the volume of people Order was correct hot and fresh  Nothing to complain about here
22273,5,My Husband had to eat at the McDonalds in Honolulu he was happy to see they had one and the price was right and the service was great
16351,5,Clean premises Professional service Delicious food When its less busy theyll come up to your table to check on your experience
16380,5,"First time to this location came at night between 10pm and midnight and was pleasantly surprised how fresh everything was and made to order the fries were fantastic and my GF loved the Oreo McFlurry

Will be back when I get my next craving"
16347,5,I had a BigMacAttack glad the sandwich was nearby this hour
16385,5,I only eat McDonalds once or twice a year and after 22 years in the neighborhood this location is  in my experience  the best of the chain within a mile of the length of Ventura Blvd  Fries have always been fresh  Service has always been efficient  Dont let long lines scare you
22248,5,"The food was hot and just as I ordered it
Remember they are busy I used the app to order me and my wifes breakfast It took about 20 minutes Remember to thank the workers for working They could probably make more money with unemployment benefi"
16457,5,This McDonalds ice cream machine has never once been broken anytime Ive ordered ice cream and thats literally the most I could ask of any fast food establishment

22217,5,The food was delicious I tried the spam egg and rice meal it was so good The service was great
22220,5,Killer an affordable place to get your grub on you need to get the local brkfest

16420,5,Great friendly efficient service for a quick bite in the car The fast food was served piping hot and the sauce to meat ratio was on targetFrench fries were seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of crunch
16419,5,I am so happy and glad that they finally reopen And a new remodel is amazing really nice
16418,5,Its a McDonalds like any other
16411,5,Although it took longer than I expected to dine on there was actually service and concern from the attentive  staff And I really like the burgers I get a qtr pounder with cheese and dont eat the  bottom bun  To cut carbs If you do it quickly the cheese doesnt melt so it very easy to go openfaced
16408,5,As always McDonalds prices are good for your pocketbook Bought it for my three little friends and they were very full And my wallet was very happy Very friendly employees as well
22238,5,Busy but good the staff was getting the orders out quickly Had a small issue but they fixed it without even asking
16398,5,Carlos the young man running the front was so friendly and all smiles even though he was getting overran and I myself was a bit of a problem for him as I had 5 kids who ordered 10 minutes apart from each other and changed their order twice He still managed to take it all in stride and got us our food in a reasonable amount of time and with a smile on his face
22243,5,Its hit or miss at this location some time the staff is friendly and sometimes they arent so friendly but I can understand it is a high traffic area because of tourist but we are all human We get burnt out The app is great by the way
22244,5,The million dollar sunset views from the patio are phenomenal
16393,5,Nice clean location Customer service was super friendly and professional Nice seating available Outside seating also available This location has 24 hr drive through Overall great experience Keep up the good work
16391,5,This is one of the best McDonalds Place is clean and it gets quite a bit of traffic Parking is tight but the drive thru24 hrs is short The staff is mostly young professionals and they represent themselves well Great fast food
16386,5,This McDonalds is fast and very easy to get in and out of
16346,5,My friend and I ate here together and we both deem this to be the best McDonalds that we have ever been to Twice the manager came around to us to make sure that everything was going well Thats a first for me at a McDonalds
22278,5,"Nice and clean
You can see Pacific Ocean and banyan tree over the window
Its awesome  experience
They serve white rice on Big breakfast
I never expected
New kiosk for fast order
Overall wonderful place
Oh I forgot
They has pineapple pie instead of apple pie
Its so good too"
16343,5,I was on drive thru so it was all good
22312,5,Very busy and chaotic but the staff were efficient and kind The place was tidy and well kept Food was great as usual
16279,5,Awesome Sevice Fresh Breakfast Sandwiches Thank You
16276,5,I always stop in to McDonalds to get a nice ice coffee with 2 pumps of sugar free vanilla You cant go 
22315,5,Nice View  SurfbBreak Across the Street Friendly Service  but No Restrooms
16275,5,Very clean and nice staff A bonus One of the people helping me with my order was from Michigan too GO GREEN And the manager was very helpful The security guard had hit wits about him
16269,5,Excellent 
22318,5,Service is fast restaurant is clean despite the amount of visitors
22319,5,Surprisingly efficient McDonalds We ordered from the kiosk and opted for the table service We ordered a whole breakfast and someone came by after 5 minutes despite the long line Note theres no washroom here so beware The workers here were constantly cleaning the tables which was great Definitely one of the best McDonalds Ive ever been to

16283,5,As always great costumer service and excellent food quality After paying close attention to the conveyor belt I see the food is made above the restaurant I think thats pretty awesome Great costumer service as always The ladies working behind the counter are definitely doing a great job
22309,5,Very affordable and much yum 
22307,5,This McDonalds location can get pretty busy Some of the meal and specific item prices are higher than other locations but thats to be expected Service is good and fast Good spot to grab an ice cream cone on a hot day
22306,5,New chicken sandwiches are tasty and priced reasonably  Only recommendation is some kind of sauce or mayo be added to this sandwich  Kind of bland and dry  The spicy chicken sandwich is too hot and also should have mayo added
16340,5,This McDonalds is one of the best The food is always prepared well I hate waiting in line but I never have to worry about that here Yes there are lines but the staff is fast and proficient and I always ask for my meals to be made fresh although it isnt always necessary Because of their popularity it always fresh and hot A good place to stop or pickup a good and hot fast meal
22282,5,This time of the night was actually a lot better as far as service wise  how long it took us to get our food It wasnt busy at all the touch screen kiosk thing really does help out a lot to be honest because the lines inside of any McDonalds can get real hectic  cause long lines  end up with a bunch of irritated customers
16337,5,"The counter girl was very friendly and helpful I want to use my app and the girl helped me out I did have to wait almost 10 minutes to get someone to take my order
Thank you"
16330,5,Best customer service weve ever had at a McDonalds and close to if not the best service weve had at any restaurant period Clean well managed and unexpectedly a very nice experience with our family of 5 little kids Thanks for exceptional service
16327,5,The rest room was clean I was craving French fries plus chicken nuggets and I got them they were nice and crisp
22286,5,I went to McDonalds at 12 AM and ordered my food online When I got there I waited about 13 minutes I believe So I walked up to the cashier and asked about my food and noticed my number still didnt come up I was shocked to find out that their computer  was down and my order was not there so they made my order right away even though there was a line of people at least 10 long I go there quite often and they remember me  I felt so blessed and thankful that they treated me so well even
22287,5,We used the touchscreen order board and circumvented the line Our food was brought to us fairly quickly I really enjoyed my scrambled eggs rice and Portuguese sausage Coffee was great as usual   My wife really liked her order that included Spam   We sat outside and watched the people walk by and gazed over at Waikiki beach Highly recommended
16325,5,Great food and service Cleanest most organized McDonalds I have ever been in
22289,5,I usually avoid McDonalds like the plague but Id be lying if I said I didnt make an acceptation with this one I only ever got coffee but it was not bad Im typically quite picky but for a dollar I got a few during my stay I enjoyed the interesting people that would come in throughout the day and also the less fortunate in the late hours Good conversations and the staff where pretty chill about the homeless most nights They are people too We only got kicked out one night but there was many of us just sleeping to be fair I appreciated the genuine staff 3
16464,5,Super clean Amazing customer service and the vibes here are really great This location is in my top 3 favorite McDonald restaurants
16319,5,Nice place very friendly Needs to be a little more quicker Its very small despite the tall building it was not busy either so the service shouldnt have taken so long
22293,5,Most beautiful McDonald in the world
22294,5,So good so fast but no bathroom
22296,5,this was great but however the workers did not approve of my orange hair and constantley called me ranga  sophie allem
16306,5,This is one of the best McDonalds I have been to They were closed for several months due to construction The great food and service has made up for the time when they were not operational The food is always hot and the Buns so far have been fresh and soft The best thing about McDonalds are the FRIES  Their fries are always fresh hot and delicious The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures I dont mind waiting in the sometimes long drivethru line for fresh food Thank you for having pride in the food you serve
16303,5,Food is always fresh My son loves when we head over after school for a little lunch
16300,5,The guys in the drive thru were so nice  Love the deals too BOGO
16299,5,What a awesome staff that works here ALWAYS smiles and willing to take your order and get it right Ketsia is just a sweetheart and very attentive to anything that is needed customer service is out of this worldConrad is wonderful and he has a pleasure to talk to always
16298,5,Im glad to see this location is finally open again Everything in the drive thru was fast smooth and consistent with what I expect from a McDonald
16293,5,This is one of the busiest McDonalds Ive seen On the rare occasions when I come here for a coffee and hashbrown in the morning this place is always packed full of hungry antsy customers The staff are incredibly patient and hardworking McDonalds customers myself included are probably the most annoying customers in the restaurant industry but
16317,5,I can always close my eyes and count on the flavor being the same decade after decade
16728,5,Like the promo and the attention here in Burbank San Fernando blvd

23006,5,"I needed a quick meal will on break at the Gaylord Palm business convention

Pros any location Im at from Shenzhen China to Hawaii to Orlando I can count on McDonalds when I land They keep the same consistent taste world wide as a business owner this is admirable This location was efficient and fast

Cons we all know its not the healthiest food but that had nothing to do with the location
So I only ate it once on my 5 day stay
McDonalds should explore healthier options for the current market  But still a great experience

22763,5,Spicy nuggets were bomb af
15494,5,I went through the drive through Friday Dec 23 2016 at about 720 am There was a young black female working the window where you pay and I have to say she set the tone for my day What a sweetheart she was all smiles and just a joy for my first stranger encounter of the day With the way things have been going in this country the last several months she was a bright spot in an otherwise dreary daily grind and I will not soon forget how she lifted my spirits all over a sausage burrito and a cup of coffee She set the bar good job
15473,5,"The lobby just opened up after having been remodeled for the past few months and its so clean Everything is looking and smelling great The staff have gotten more accurate and faster Highly recommend
Edit I forgot to mention they have those kiosks to order yourself which severely reduces waiting time An employee was even willing to show me how to use the darn thing I refused of course
Edit 2 5292019 Being the lover of caramel that I am it should come as no surprise that Im in love with the newtoAmerica stroopwafel McFlurry Highly recommend giving that a try"
15472,5,Its hot and good and lots of Big Mac sauce 
22805,5,Its nice to still have some locations open 24 hours And despite mobile parkpickup or the dining room being closed The way in which the team here was able to expedite the dining room was amazing

15364,5,This is the best McDonalds I have been to in a long time   I have 1 across the street from my apartment and I wish I could swap them out  Service at THIS McDonalds is excellent and everyone that I interacted with was friendly and helpful  The food actually looked like the advertising and tasted good  I was so impressed that I asked for the manager so I could thank him and compliment his crew  I truly believe that managers affect everything about their restaurant  for  good or bad Happy respected employees who feel properly valued always reflect that in their interactions with customers and you could see that this manager was a leader of a team and not just the boss Great McDonalds experience
22825,5,Excellent and fast service The food was good
22797,5,More than 30 min of wait 2 buses should have arrived and both routes are late I dont get it if  paying with our taxes for this service plus a fare of 2  the ride where is the investment of the company on providing a good services more buses more bus drivers better service better budget I called and the Lady on the phone left me waiting on hold Ill seek for an investigation in this situation hopefully Public resources are being well managed RIGHT 
15538,5,The last person just said this place is outdated and mentioned that there are iPads on the tabe For some reason that doesnt make sense to me I just went there and ordered some food The manager who took my order joked around with me making me laugh Thats always a plus After I payed I decided that I wanted an ice cream cone The manager dude that took my order just gave me the ice cream cone on the house The food I ordered was delicious too Thanks yall Ill be back for sure now

Hot a caramel frappuccino and a strawberry milkshake both came beautifully presented
Cant say a bad thing about this store keep up the good work guys 5 "
21236,5,Who thinks of reviewing a fast food place  Well if you receive outstanding service from a teenager working hard then the establishment and all the employees deserve a 5star rating Not only did the employee flawlessly do his job He took the time to observe my car while in the drive thru to tell me my tire was going flat We all know that could have been disastrous had I kept going Great job

17238,5,Here you get hot food and friendly faces We go there every first Saturday of the month And always have a good time
17236,5,This location was a pleasant experience and in the overnight shift no less This is in my recent experience with the fast food industry as a whole excluding chick FIL a a rare occurrence and I feel that I have to give some praise here
17234,5,"Let me just say I dont think Ive ever gone out of my way to leave a review for a fast food chain Especially not the biggest in the world Its so easy to think of these places as just another installment in a gigantic corporation but I think its important to remember that these places are made up of the individuals who work there

For that reason after coming here for a couple of years I have to say that they do a phenomenal job I only ever go through the drivethru but after being so used to no smiles miserable demeanors and a lack of basic customer service skills thank you have a nice day I need to shout out how friendly and consistent everyone at the drivethru line is here

The women who take your payment are always nice and even the woman who hands out the food usually a job where you will get absolutely zero smiles is always so nice and genuine

If somebody owns a business and is looking for a good customer service and people who will treat customers as expected then give people a shot based on everyday encounters like these"

26384,5,Great place to eat by the beach without the ridiculous prices  Beware that many homeless people ask you for change but never wanna change the sense of direction his life is unnerving to give people money as they bother while consuming meat patties between buns of bread with seeds Moral of this review is to never help homeless while eating
26385,5,Gets very very busy  but they are normally fairly rapid about getting everyone through By far the cheapest food place in that area so ideal if youre just visiting Its still McDonalds though so dont expect anything different from every other franchise

26390,5,This place is a major tourist hub as it is located within a few blocks from the Santa Monica Pier Inside is nice They will also bring food to you that you wont see in any other store or this may be new to me since I have been to Mcdonalds only a few times in my entire life
9662,5,Clean Fast service

Open your mind and empty your heart of fears so that you can know and experience God to the fullest Lord You are my peace my assurance and the love that I hold on toReach higher than you think possible for all that you want and you find that often you attain even more Lord I rely on Your promises made to each of us and especially on Your love
Be patient with others but mostly be patient with yourself Lord help me to keep a smile on my face and to realize my goodness and refuse to dwell on my imperfectionsDesiring more and more without appreciating what you have right now will never allow you to be truly happy Be grateful for the gifts you are receiving right this very minute Thats happinessGod gives abundantly to those who pass His gifts on to others Lord let Your blessings flow in to me and then out from me I will neither be selfish nor let my gifts stagnate
Use Jesus as your example on how to live Lord You will guide and advise us and then You will leave it to us to decide our own future Give us wisdom in our choicesDear Lord thank you for being such a loving God and caring about our pain You dont want to see us suffer You know the suffering that we face and I ask that you would please redeem it and bring it to an end In the midst Lord I believe that you are sufficient I ask that your strength will be made perfect in our weakness In Jesuss name amen"

25700,5,Good people good place to stop and get a bite to eat that this McDonalds
25701,5,Best McDonalds there is  The atmosphere is life size zoo animals and sounds reflective of the Dallas zoo next door
10752,5,Shocking that in the center of a tourist attraction where every restaurants is 4x the price with 20 tax and added gratuity this mcdonalds was priced just like the ones at home  Dollar menu and all  No its not the best food but you gotta give em props for not triple pricing and ripping off tourists  Its weird they had triple cheeseburger
10750,5,Best place to get a cheap breakfast in Miami
10738,5,Pretty funny  only in miami you get guava paste and cheese pieat McDonalds im use to get apple pies at McDonalds in the midwest
25710,5,Long lines but wait was short Employees were fast and friendly Clean bathroom
10721,5,Hahahahahhaah Mcdonalds is always good idea 
10720,5,Gotta Love how you pay for your food and the employees act like they are doing you a favor when you ask for your own coffee to be handed to you several times like if Im asking for something free SMH And dont ask for condiments like salt or jelly they really get annoyed nasty attitudes and all Sad how one rotten employee spoils it for the rest of the environment
25714,5,A very unique McDonalds since it is next to the Dallas Zoo it has a Zoo theme inside Nice from the norm to take the children
10719,5,They actually had a working McFlurry machines and the food was good
25717,5,Still the best McDonalds to take the kids to playold but clean and everyone is very nice
10707,5,I went twice when visiting and had no problems I really enjoyed t being right next to the shopping strip I highly recommend for those who come really early
10706,5,Nice Mcdonalads busy but I got food very very fast I reccomand if you want a quick bite
25720,5,Very friendly customer service n fresh hot food
25721,5,Nuggets were hot and fresh
25722,5,Same as always Drive thru was a tad long but still got thru in a timely fashion

10773,5,This location is always goodbecause its in the heart of tourist location the food is always fresh and hot Its now a hang out spot all the tourist and locals and decor is nice They have soo much seating and its really spacious Ive been ordering the same thing for years The quarter pounder with Mac sauce
10939,5,The best meal for the best price that I had in Miami
25694,5,Order was spot on and woman at drive thru window was awesome for it being Jan 1 at 330 am
10800,5,I really do not even like McDonalds but despite extremely crowded here I experienced was the best service Ive received in South Beach The only attentive person I met at that region was this McDonalds attendant The sandwich and the rest of the experience was exactly the same as here BR
10931,5,Crystal was the manager the night i was in she was very attentive she listened to me and right away solved my issue and gave me such a nice dining experience that night thank you so mush crystal and your wonderful staff

10922,5,Open 24 hours and serves all day breakfast
10908,5,Amazing place thank for your services
25674,5,The manager named Amber was awesome So was the crew
10907,5,Despite it being rush hour in Miami Beach the place didnt seem dirty nor the restrooms The is no parking near the McDonalds so youd have to find a way to park yourself Customer Interaction was minimal which was goodfor me because this McDonalds had a purchasing mechanism for people to buy whatever they want there and receive a receipt to show the cashier and youre basically done all thats left is waiting for your food Quick Tip You are able to pay with cash if you prepurchase but the money will go to the cashier not the mechanism The mechanism does accept any kind of CreditDebit card
25677,5,Hard to describe
10899,5,Food amazing Prepared quick and fresh Everything was sooo good Burger fresh fries fresh and hotReminded me of McDonalds food from the 90s
10872,5,The wait in the lines was a turn off but its understandable because of its location theres a high demand because people seek fast food something fast to eat Just like any Mcdonalds location the meal will fill you but you may want to take it to go if you die for those peaceful eats
10865,5,Clean rest rooms I
10862,5,Great place  great prices
10849,5,Fast and efficient staff
10838,5,Known as the homeless McDonalds There kinda slow and really English dosnt work well here But generally all you would expect from McDonalds Service is slow
10829,5,I normally do not eat fast food but I stayed out late and placed an order at 430am The service was fast and friendly The food came out correct hot and fresh Overall great experience
10827,5,Good drive through service And the telltale fish filet sandwich was cooked perfectly  I would ask people leaving the drive through to NOT come back out onto the 16th street because it causes havoc at that light  Please follow the signs around to the left  Its not that far out of you wont have to be rude and prevent people from turning right on red
10817,5,I am a big admirer of Bear Freaks doing man vs wild in Discovery channel From his program I have learnt about Everglades Maybe I would think I would never visit this place But it just happened without giving a thought to it So obviously I loved it I believe nobody would disagree who visited this place already
10811,5,Well the Chicken Burger  Beef Burgers  Fries were the best weve had The Milkshakes are the most delicious ones weve ever had with all that cream on the top Yummy
10806,5,"I like the braveness  curiosity of Mac to try the automated standing servers  
I do not care if the idea worked or not but he took the risk That is what business is all about
Okay guy nice location next to the touristic places of Lincoln Rd  Washington Ave  I gave it 5 stars because they deserve it  if u compare this location to others  to other fast food places Super clean regardless of the homeless community in SoBe"

11400,5,This McDonalds is really great they are always friendly and helpful never have had a problem and people comments on the homeless here but it has never been a problem and they usually stay outside but homeless is a problem everywhere and they are human just like everyone whos putting them down

25529,5,McDonalds is great It is a sure thing You know you what to expect Today I was surprised A new burger caught my eye It is a Spain inspired burger I was hesitant about buy in it This was new and well it could be great or ruin my lunch BUT I took a chance aaand Oh my goodness It was sooooooooo yummy I mean it was so yummy that I hardly touched my delicious fries Well my normal favorite is the quarter pounder with cheese  today it was that Spain inspired burger I guess it was the cheese or the saucenormally I dont like sauces on my burger but I dont know if it was the combination of bacon the different cheeses or what but it was soooo good Yum I will have to come back to this McDonalds I dont think they sell this burger in just any McDonalds I think it has to be in one of the safari themed ones Anyway it was really good It made my day I was happy the rest of my meetings and sessions Normally it would be boring but hey my tummy was cheerful and so was I
25531,5,I frequently visit this McDonalds and Im never disappointed which I know isnt saying alot but these days normal as advertised service is a hard to come by thing
25533,5,Had great service last night fast and friendly with fresh food
11365,5,Much better now that they remodeled it It used to have that feeling of homeless feeder but not anymore It
11364,5,Allways I had good experiences it is my favorite place to be all the time great people many cultures good food they cook very well and clean

26499,5,The World largest McDonalds is a must to visit if you have kids Besides the typical menu items you can order pasta and pizza customized to order The dessert menu is not a large selection but pretty tasty Only downside is the wait for the food  about 30 minutes for us so the food was room temperature when we received it Of course the kids can and will spend hours exploring the play area and arcade a few of the games were out of order and not many prizes to choose from The place was packed when we visited Overall a good experience
26503,5,Wow Every McDonalds should be like this place in my opinion They have arcade games and a playground all in the second floor Kids love it here we easy spend about 2 hours playing and eating and playing again All food orders are made using the kiosks on the first floor and you take a number and find yourself a table Your order will be brought to yo

26627,5,This is one of the busiest McDonalds Ive seen On the rare occasions when I come here for a coffee and hashbrown in the morning this place is always packed full of hungry antsy customers The staff are incredibly patient and hardworking McDonalds customers myself included are probably the most annoying customers in the restaurant industry but
26631,5,This is one of the best McDonalds I have been to They were closed for several months due to construction The great food and service has made up for the time when they were not operational The food is always hot and the Buns so far have been fresh and soft The best thing about McDonalds are the FRIES  Their fries are always fresh hot and delicious The best part is they stand straight up in the box just as they do on the commercials and pictures I dont mind waiting in the sometimes long drivethru line for fresh food Thank you for having pride in the food you serve

9351,5,I placed my order on a screen in the store It was very efficient The staff are very friendly and helpful However you find a lot of people hanging around the place because of a liaison office of one of the Latin American countries The environment is somewhat sombre Other than that we had a good meal

8571,5,The food was good the price was reasonable and the people at the drivethru were very kind We got through in a reasonable amount of time We did not use their playground this time but from past experience I can say that my little one really does like it quite a bit To the point I can barely get him away
8560,5,Loved everything from the service to the food Between the promotions and coupons I save money The loyalty points build up then I can get a free item Today O had a large mocha frappe Yum
8617,5,In that whole area that is the best McDonalds they have extremely and friendly employees there very personable The drivethru is very fast they are very friendly they repeat orders back to you asked if you would like your receipt ask how your day has been The parking lot is very clean considering that that area has a lot of problems with litter Their sodas are always refreshing and cold they dont ever taste watery they put together their hamburgers meet me so the Patty or the sauces are not dripping or the patties falling out of the bun I very much recommend this McDonalds than any other McDonalds in the area
8558,5,This place sucks they worrie about drive through and leave the lobby wit people wait for their food for more then 30 mins my kids were hungry gave us the wrong happy 3 times I will never go back to this one I am givin it 5 stars jus so people will be able to see the review

8700,5,I like the way they do the egg McMuffin with sausage here I think its just the muffins arent toasted so much so theyre a little softer everything else seems fresh and tasty This one happens to have a bunch of oneway streets around it but soon as you know that you can figure out how to get in and out Fast service in the DriveThru no complaints
8699,5,Got me a good breakfast for the whole famz for a good price Haha and I have the app so I made enuff points to get me a free big mac haha

26916,5,This McDonalds is kicking ass and taking names Puts the others to shame Love this location
26918,5,Didnt expect such great drivethru so early in the morning

26922,5,I had forgotten to order my cheeseburgers without onions but the lovely man behind the counter had them remade just for me at no charge
8656,5,What can I say its McDonalds but at least when Ive gotten food here is been got and as freshtasting as one could ever hope for with fastfood I hate cold fries but Ive never gotten any from this store Ive also never been treated poorly here so I have no complaints at all
8655,5,They have implemented the selforder kiosk machines and the newer soda dispensers with the touchscreen Restaurant was clean and everything was in order Didnt have much interaction with employees there but they seemed nice Overall great experience Especially for a McDonalds restaurant which isnt generally somewhere you go for a good customer experience I was pleased with my quick visit
26925,5,Greatmy granddaughter loves your oreo cookies icecream
8639,5,where do I start in the past and present they help me with coin free food coupon or no coupon like buger king the youth and all ages help and work together they even accept older coupons I went to many taco bells lets see I think the corporation are with  KFC there have been nice to me mostly when Im so tired and just want one or two items like McDonalds they wait even when there in a hurry I so need that when everyone wants to push through life and I know each day is a blessing Im so sorry if I combined other types of Corp with Mc Donalds its hard to remember all who what I dont know how many charters this is I just wanted to say Im glad people have work all over the world and people buy food and give to others also I hope they increase the fast food as well as resterants workers income very soon they feed us when were tired and food is to expensive it helps the farmers with there crops around the world sad to say so many states get hit with disasters and there goes fast food and fun eateries thats all everyone take care and lets keep loving our neighbors world wide agape sister rogers
26930,5,They are always crowded n drive through as well but the service makes up for it
8633,5,Pretty solid McDs  This one honors the liberty card which gives a free matching sandwich with 
8625,5,McDonalds as most people already know is one of the most popular burger places At this location service was pretty good and everything but the thing was that when we got a happy meal the box was the Eternals theme but the toy was from Encanto I really dont know if they want to make a superhero magic mix 
8551,5,Had a company party here and they were very friendly about accommodating 30 of us TBH none of us were expecting much from the food and we were all quite surprised at how good it was Well do this place again and also add it to our lunch rotation
8550,5,Food was good and came quickly  Staff friendly
26962,5,The McDonalds at Riverside was confusing because there was no River and this McDonalds was not at its side
8482,5,Excellent customer service The gentleman at the drive thru was friendly helpful and courteous
26996,5,Its cheap but filling and really tasty
26997,5,Business is booming excellent food and fast service
8480,5,What is a good stop at McDonalds I dont go often but when I do usually grabbing a 2C combo Reminds me the old Californi
8469,5,I came right at closing time and the manager took my order then when I got to the first window I was told sorry we are closed I told him someone repeated my order and went to ask at the same time the manager came to the first window after telling his coworker the situation the manager hurry and got payment then hurried back to round up my order while everyone else was getting ready to leave he then got my order to me fast and fresh I couldnt have been more pleased with the service and the good attitude If the workforce had more employees like this  manager the world would be a lot better place to work in
8464,5,"I was doordashing at the time I would never eat at McDonalds because Im Vegan Just want to make that clear
This experience was not the best demonstration of a streamlined or very efficient process in expediting fast food

The order I was waiting on took a whooping 15 minutes and was given to someone else without an apology That being said I would have rated them with 1 star but I decided to walk in and watch the process
The customer service was what I would expect given the employees having to deal with the distractions from the crowd of people inquiring about their order

 Customers can look up at the monitors above the counter to see the process of their order

The average gluttonous starving American that eats at McDonalds behaves as though their needs are of paramount importance Its one of the best examples you can witness of bloated selfentitlement
McDonalds employees you are doing a good job and on behalf of the Jerry Springer audience members that eat at your restaurant Please forgive them"
8460,5,fast here
8459,5,Very good as always Oh and in the one you visit you can eat inside the premises

8449,5,The food was ready very quickly the place was super neat The quality of the food especially the fries is excellent
8493,5,Tonight 021723 I was in this McDonalds things were calm and fine Then all of the sudden some guy started yelling at the staff about customer service Demanding customer service number to complain Fine thats his right But as the lady at the register tried to help him he kept yelling at her They said that he was an officer in the Army To me that is disgraceful and highly insulting that anyone would use rank and the military to treat people like that I dont believe he is any sort of military let alone an officer  And I did tell him that if he is a retired military officer he is a disgrace of a former officer To which he wanted to go out and fight me Furthering my belief he is no officer I was an E4 Specialist and know that he or any other member of any military force is trained to use rank or status as an excuse to belittle anyone And if you do you disgrace the uniform the military and your country by treating anyone with disrespect  Ill stand up to anyone who triess that type of behavior  The staff at McDonalds was doing a fantastic job my food is delicious  Thank you

8763,5,They have cleaned it up There is a security guard who works for McDonalds to keep the riff raff out  Its clean nice and calm  I definetly recommend going here  There is no locks on the bathroom even  I was impressed and will go back when Im downtown again
8752,5,The franchise is good  Years ago when I ate there regularly  the owner would be there often  she worked onthe line and if you didnt know her you would never know  Went back recently  I dont know if she still works in the store  but it was as good as I remembered
26888,5,We got mcdonalds then we drove to San Diego and than I proposed to my wife at tuna park
8746,5,Employees this time are little less stressed Also the new look of the store compared with the old 200 years old one makes everything else easier even dealing with those always non conformist customers
8743,5,This McDonalds was the perfect way to end our night at the Quarters bar Their staff was friendly and fast and they had the new pokemon happy meals even though we came at 130 in the morning We even got the rare holographic pikachu pokemon card as a toy in the happy meal
8728,5,"really this is a 45 star review this McDonalds is located downtown salt lake city and everyone who lives here knows that parking downtown is almost impossible sometimes Now mind you this parking lot is massive for McDonalds way bigger than what the store needs so people try to take advantage of McDonalds by parking here and going elsewhere

For those idiots that are crying about their car getting booted they were obviously trying to take advantage  even if they were McDonalds customers Theres signs posted all over that are plain as day stating 30 minute parking only otherwise subject to getting booted or towed  the sign also blatantly says DO NOT LEAVE THESE PREMISES WITHOUT YOUR VEHICLE so for everyone else crying try reading the freaking sign You know those metal signs cost money and they werent custom made for entertainment or cosmetic purposes use your brains

on another note I visited here my first time just now food was as expected for McDonalds but its not like a good cook could make that any better staff was fast friendly and effective And my order was accurate 5 a star for closing the lobby at night but once again I dont blame them Theres a lot of crazies out there especially in the midnight and early morning hours"
26892,5,I dont really eat food at Mcdonalds but I stopped in there frequently for their hazelnut iced coffee
26894,5,McDs is always a good time but this time was great All thanks to the cool staff
26895,5,Small but friendly and clean
8716,5,They are so fast here  Im kind of picky so I order my stuff without this or with that and they get it right every time and keep the line moving  Friendly people too
26898,5,McDonald
8713,5,Probably the fastest most simple and delicious experience I have had with McDonalds so far The management is on top of it with the system they have going I really respect that after the many disappointments I have had with McDonalds before  They know what theyre doing at this location Its great
8811,5,I love the dollar menu Spicy McChickens all the way I can get 6 of them for the price of one Big Mac Not that I do that thats too much I usually get two and some sauces to add to them Tastes great and fills me up
26871,5,Ive never had a problem at this location The best employees thus far
26869,5,Very good service and my food came out really quick good coffee and quality food

26864,5,Fast service friendly bathroom wasnt available over all thank you
8846,5,work here Most dont know but we have a new store manager and I hope this manager keeps everything more organized What most people dont know is that the other manager never put the effort needed for the store therefore most slacked off Ive worked here about 3 to 4 months and like it so far but some managers arent the nicest me Ive been working for McDonalds for about a year I come in everyday with a smile on my face no matter how bad my day is I read these reports and think  these bad employeesmanagers make not only themselves look bad but me too I will continue to have great customer service most people get mad we take too long the Damn store has broken appliences every week yeah they should replace it but wont just keep repairing it till its done anyways point being very disappointing knowing we still get a bad review when I try hard to make everyone happy Thank All yall Javier Elizondo
26855,5,Besides the guy with the meth pipe going through the trash the food is as expected Its not McDonalds fualt there is a methademic
8004,5,My kids loved McDonalds but I want back my steak bagel breakfast that was the best
25480,5,I buy my drinks there The Management staff there does not have a problem giving me honey with my coffee The Managers and their staff are always asking their patrons is everything ok and will address small problems with a smile  even the homeless Not like the rude manager that I have reported twice on Robert B Cullom 75215 in South dallas and I never heared anything back from McDonald about that  As she stated they are only going to redirect you back to me  Since I havent heard anything back Im going on Social Media about that manager in the South Dallas McDonalds
25477,5,Stopped in late around 1am but received good service area  around drive thru was clean despite age of building and outdated signage for the play place but received order and the team member even placed an extra sauce I requested at the window in a separate bag instead of trying to shove 5 in my hand like most do
13623,5,We come here every time we are in Orlando and this was the first time we tried the pasta  It was a little disappointing that you couldnt add chicken or sausage to it but was delicious nonetheless The pizza and chocolate cake we also very good  The store was well maintained and clean  The staff was friendly despite the business
24096,5,Warm cookies and smiley faces
24097,5,This is how a McDonalds should run
13622,5,A nice big building that lives up to its hype The entertainment can help the kids distract and enjoying been kids again  Food was good pizza chocolate cake woowwww
13620,5,Well this was an experience It was definitely fun for the kids Arcade and a huge play area when I went to the play area was closed but it was big This McDonalds has 2 floors and the typical McDonalds food the twist there is they also sell pasta dishes and pizza Wow I know right
24101,5,Good food
24102,5,Exelent Fast service
13619,5,"Dude   worlds largest McDonalds But it is NOT the worlds largest McDonalds parking lot There was hardly enough parking for cars let alone bigger vehicles
We have a 26 ft Class C RV There is no oversized parking We got lucky with parking but others did not

But seriously If your family likes McDonalds this McDonalds is worth it
We ordered pizza and chocolate cake at McDonalds
Cake was delicious Pizza was not terrible 

But the most memorable part was the second floor Not only is there an incredible gigantic threestory all enclosed play place with a single entryexit point There is also an extremely large arcade with all sorts of varound a corner and cant be seen from the dining area  For kids that must play a game there are 2 dining tables with touchscreens

Theres plenty of seating both upstairs and on the main floor and clean bathrooms on both levels

The kids will remember this McDonalds"
24104,5,Very good
13617,5,"Pretty awesome place On top of your standard items they sell pasta pizza and pastries Surprisingly the pizza and pasta was quite good for McDonalds The place also offers a very reasonable arcade 5 unlimited play for 30 minutes The only draw back to the timed purchase is that you dont earn tickets They do have a trade in booth with prizes for your tickets
Overall we came here for the experience of going to the worlds largest McDonalds and came out pretty satisfied with the while experience Enjoy yall"
24107,5,Good food good service
24108,5,Quick service
24109,5,Hot food fast service
13615,5,"BIGGEST MCDONALDS IN THE WORLD

We drove by this McDonalds and talked about how it was probably one of the biggest McDonalds in the world After googling it it was So we had to stop in

It was definitely a cool experience They offer More options than just the traditional McDonalds We did build our own pasta and the pasta was excellent

They also offer pizzas and different pastry options Like cheesecake cake ice cream specialties

This is a twolevel McDonalds but looks to be four stories

The first floor is the dining and kitchen Second floor is a large play place thats two storage tall and they also have a arcade where you can earn points towards toy prizes Kind of like Chuck e cheese

We spent a few hours here Its spent around 30 for four of us So it wasnt that bad

Definitely cool to say you into the biggest McDonalds in the world"
13613,5,This place is really busy Not your average McDonalds they serve pasta desserts and pizza at this location We waited about 2530 minutes for 2 happy meals Only went here for the experience I will staff the staff was very professional and polit
13612,5,This being billed as the largest McDonalds in the world I had to stop and see it It is certainly BIG They have a dessert station brick oven for pizza and huge play area for the kids When I stopped it was busy and the employees were friendly and helpful The restaurant and dining area appeared clean which is difficult to do in a high volume fast food restaurant I just grabbed a burger and shake and it was typical McDonalds
24113,5,Great job
24114,5,Nice place and clean
13611,5,"This McDonalds is definitely a must be location if youre a fan of the Big Mac the pizza is surprisingly good the staff is super kind they constantly ask you if you need help her if everything is good

Theres plenty of tables to accommodate everybody wait time and fast

And if youre CocaCola connoisseur the soda fountain is perfect

Super clean upstairs as a full arcade really cool if you have kids definitely stop by here you have a chance"

Punch in your order on the screen pay then find a seat and staff will find you to deliver your meal Philly Cheese steak was our 1 pick the stone oven thin crust pizza was great and the pasta considering it was from a fast food place was very good Kids loved the arcade and play place too"
13634,5,We had an amazing experience you ordered upfront and got your number and they brought the food to you You can personalize your own spaghetti   and pizza It costs 15 the plate McDonalds food is the regular price as in all McDonalds it has a real big park upstairs and an arcade which is amazing for the kids to enjoy the only thing that I didnt like was that it was wayyyyyyy to HOT upst
24077,5,Very good
13631,5,For this to be the largest McDonalds I wasnt sure what to expect My daughter wanted to stop by while we were visiting It was very busy as to be expected Staff was friendly Really cool spot They even have pizza and pasta on the menu How awesome lol
13630,5,Well obviously es a different place in comparatively other McDonalds but be ready to a lot of people childrens yelling and running anyways still such a amazing placethey cook a good pizza that was oh  Worth it
13628,5,"This McDonalds has everything Even pizza and pasta

13608,5,"This Big McDonalds is a very nice establishment The staff seemed to be efficient and friendly Even better than the food was the arcade 5 for 30 mins of unlimited play A few games are broken but that was okay If you choose to buy credits instead you can buy things with the tickets you earn Like chuckecheese

Note The playplace is currently closed due to covid it will soon open according to my sources though"
13568,5,Big 24 hour service restaurant with outdoor seating
13566,5,Nice place with outdoor seating area

24163,5,We visited this while on a vacation to Orlando with our team What an experience Theres a lot of different food options including PIZZA The place is amazing If you are ever in or near the Orlando area it is absolutely worth the time to stop in and see this place Unbelievable
24164,5,Great Mcdonalds Really love the clean store the big mac is delicious and so are the breakfast items and chicken nuggets The convention is right here so there are a lot of tourists but they have a self serve kiosk that helps to speed up taking orders Highly recommend this store if youre in the area The service is nice and there are plenty of places to sit down to eat Be careful leaving the parking lot though as international drive the road is pretty interesting at times In conclusion I rate this McDonalds 55 and I hope to be back soon to take out more food to do mukbangs
13561,5,ILoveMacFonaldmake me Beautyful flashback 
24167,5,Right place at the right time It was a wonderful drive thru experience  right choice given those inside Very busy in Orlando but food was fresh  exactly what I needed going back to Tampa

13609,5,This McDonalds is known as the biggest
13573,5,"Love the worlds largest McDonalds  Has a kids Play Place fun arcade upstairs elevator can order pizza and many other cool menu items

Although usually busy service is on pace Got my meal in about 15 minutes  I love this location Found parking in about 10 minutes"
13577,5,The World largest McDonalds is a must to visit if you have kids Besides the typical menu items you can order pasta and pizza customized to order The dessert menu is not a large selection but pretty tasty Only downside is the wait for the food  about 30 minutes for us so the food was room temperature when we received it Of course the kids can and will spend hours exploring the play area and arcade a few of the games were out of order and not many prizes to choose from The place was packed when we visited Overall a good experience
24121,5,Great place
24123,5,For the size of the building and play facilities in this McDonalds its the biggest and the best If youre looking for customer service not a chance  Youre better off using the kiosks and have patience waiting for your order Ill recommend this place for the experience only and works with your children
24124,5,This McDonalds was awesome Ive never been to a McDonalds where the service was so good and the food options were amazing  
13606,5,This is the busiest McDonalds Ive ever been to They have the process of customer care down to a science If you order to go use a kiosk because eating in could take a while because a server has to walk the food over They have a pastry cafe and the play area is massive The employees are nice and gave great service Just a heads up I would avoid the drive thru between the hours of 7amMidnight Those are the times when people are either going or coming from theme park
13604,5,"We are in Orlando Florida celebrating my sons 13th birthday so why not check out the worlds largest McDonalds
The place is huge with people from all places checking it out too
Its 2nd floor is full of arcade games and a childrens play area
They have a pasta and pizza section with a brick oven
They have multiple touch screen ordering kiosks with people always in queue
I ordered online with the McDonalds app and picked it up in store or else I would have waited in line
The whole store is bright and clean including the restrooms
One thing you like about McDonalds its the same flavor anywhere in the world you go"
24127,5,The manager at this store is absolutely outstanding  They just reintroduced the steak bagel and I said what can I change the bread to a McGriddle and she did that without a single question I even went as far as to ask her if I have the round egg instead of the folded and she jumped right to it and that was fantastic Try it sometime its wonderful thank you very much and God bless
24128,5,I put in an order for instore pickup but didnt realize that the dining room closed at 12 The store manager Emma and the rest of the staff were super accommodating and allowed us into the building and got us our food very quickly Great customer service
24130,5,Its McDonald
13600,5,This by far is one of the coolest McDonalds you will ever go to It apparently is one of the largest in the world and is 3 to 4 stories tall It has a special menu that is only designed for this McDonalds specifically which makes it extremely unique they have made to order pastas and pizzas now I went today at 115 in the afternoon in order to pizza and I got it within 15 minutes but before warned if you go during a busy time it could take up to 45 minutes and unfortunately that is the downfall dislocation is on Sand Lake Road which is in a tourism driven area off of International Drive and it is one of the busiest locations you will ever go to if you go during one of these peak times it is unbelievable how busy and how disorganized the location can actually be but when they are firing on all cylinders it can be a fantastic experience when you get the pieces or the pastas it is absolutely high and restaurant quality its literally amazing to go into a McDonalds for god sakes and get restaurant quality food of this caliber my pizza is Ace stone Brick Oven fired pizza and it is fantastic And it was only a little over 11 with tax that is wonderful if youre ever in the area you should definitely try it 
13596,5,Fantastic restaurant You must visit when in Orlando The service was good The wait time for the premium menu items was reasonable It was very clean and the staff was exceptional
24138,5,Friendly fast service  Kiosks made it easy to place your order  The food was delicious and hot  Very busy location but hardly no wait The dining area was nice and clean
13593,5,Came in on a Thursday night after a Magic game around 1015 pm for the first time  It was crowded with adults and children  The ordering lines were long and playground was 70 full  Seeing a few people with luggage and felt this could be there first or last meal in Orlando  This is the biggest McDonalds in the world and the menus are different too with pizza and pasta  We tried the pizza and it was actually pretty good
13588,5,Great experience We came here on a recent trip to Orlando They have a large selection of foods They also serve pizza and pasta There is a large bakery selection On the second floor you can dine at one of the many tables or play in the large arcade There is a large kids play area but that is currently closed due to COVID
24145,5,Always friendly staff Fairly clean and food to order Shout out to all workers and managers
13587,5,We had the best time visiting the Largest McDonalds in the World  This place is GREAT  A must see if youre in the area  I had the pizza and it was fantastic  Next time Ill try the pasta  Staff was super friendly  helpful as well
13586,5,If you love McDonalds this is the place to go They say its the worlds largest McDonalds The menu is definitely a bit different with pizza pasta and waffles as options There was even an arcade upstairs and a elevator to get up The sign says the restaurant is open 247 which is nice when leaving the amusement parks
13583,5,We couldnt wait to visit The atmosphere is a little hectic but the food is amazing Definitely not food you would eat at your hometown McDonalds Highly recommend the pesto pasta and chocolate peanut butter cake Dont forget to visit the arcade and play center upstairs Watch your childs face light up when you pull into the parking lot Highly recommend
13581,5,Wow Every McDonalds should be like this place in my opinion They have arcade games and a playground all in the second floor Kids love it here we easy spend about 2 hours playing and eating and playing again All food orders are made using the kiosks on the first floor and you take a number and find yourself a table Your order will be brought to yo
13578,5,"Hands down best McDonalds ever We loved the game room
The prices were so reasonable 25 was more than enough chips to play for as long as we wanted
They restaurant was clean the food was fresh and staff was friendly It also had an elevator that goes to and from the game room and restaurant"
24155,5,Being in the area this is a must see place Had a great meal overall It was busy but got almost all our food very quick but the pizza Quite understandable that the pizza would take longer but the only thing is that by the time it arrived my fries were almost cold No big deal but they should keep that in mind Other than that the pizza was great and service was good Ive worked McDonald
13647,5,Ive obviously been to McDonalds before but none like this Tried the pizza and Ill have to admit its not perfect but its definitely not bad Crust is a little thin for me The activities are upstairs and its like a small Dave  Busters If youve never been think about it Its not a life changer but fun to see at least once
13649,5,"I love McDonalds Not just their food but the corporation as a whole I think its awesome to visit McDonalds in other Countries for their typical off menu items Although Ive been to Orlando various times I never knew that this city housed a different McDonalds experience

I tried several versions of their pasta I also tried their cheese pizza and peanut butter chocolate cake All of these items were EXCELLENT

I never thought Id eat pasta from McDonald"
24061,5,Every 1 luvs Micki ds
23987,5,Fast and friendly  Your average McDonalds
13703,5,This is by far the best McDonalds my family and I have ever been to The food was prepared with love and quality The options for food was amazing I was able to get a veggie pizza that was cooked to perfection The game room upstairs was one of a kind The customer service was outstanding This will be an orlando visit every time we come to Orlando
13701,5,This is the largest McDonalds in the world The menu is much larger here as well I ordered the Philly cheese steak Giant playground and arcade on the 2nd floor Cool experience
13700,5,Worlds largest McDonalds and the only McDonalds which serves pizza Which by the way was quite nice freshly made there with a good selection of toppings available As well as the usual McDonalds food Plenty of seating available utilising multiple floors
13698,5,This is the only McDonalds in the whole United States that serves pizza I stopped here after passing through it because it looked like a beautiful building on the outside with multiple floors The pizza we had was delicious
13697,5,Love this place Theres so much fun inside After eating you can play some game the game  room is upstairs on the second floor Theyre all types of games its remind me
13693,5,Very nice and freandly place to eat foodA lot of space to play for childrenVery nice Staff
13690,5,This is a big two floor McDonalds with not only the typical fries and burgers but also pizza salads and other foods They have a kids playground and also an arcade and game area on the second floor
23996,5,I Love it
23997,5,Great service thank you
23998,5,Always a fast good meal
13689,5,This was my first time visiting this location The staff was very nice and service was great The atmosphere was very good We just didnt get to visit the second floor because the elevator was closed
13688,5,This location is said to be the largest McDonalds in the world We stopped in after a day at Universal We arrived after 11 and it was crazy busy Our order took at least 30min before it was readybut under the very busy circumstances it was understandable They have unique dishes such as pasta and wood fired pizza which seemed very popular Multi level seatinggames room and various entertainment segments through the store as well to make the experience even better Lots of free parking and dual drive thru Overall this McDonalds is a flagship location for sure
24001,5,The staff are always friendly

23981,5,They did us a good one today
13705,5,The traditional burgers and fries were served Luke warm As busy as the restaurant was I was truly expecting hot and fresh Perhaps had I ordered the pizza or pasta my experience would have been different The service was nothing out of the ordinary however the staff was friendly The best part of the visit was the arcade and play area my kids absolutely love it we were there for hours and hours
13704,5,This is the coolest McDonalds ever You order on a kiosk pick up a number sign type in the number after you order and they bring you your food because the number sign has a gps tracker in it It is two floors serves pasta and pizza and also has a cake shop The kids w

24011,5,Very clean Staff was nice
24039,5,Super friendly
13661,5,This place was wicked crazy I went with family and we all did our own orders and they missed at least 2 items for every single one of our orders It was bizarre Ive never seen a McDonalds that serves pizza and pasta and has an arcade The upstairs where the kids playground and the arcade were was SO HOT It was probably borderline unsafe for how hot it was for being inside the building Especially since the kids playplace was up there I would be afraid of kids getting getting dehydrated and potentially even getting heatstroke
13660,5,Unfortunately we didnt have the best experience here We waited almost an hour for our pizzas and many of the employees didnt seem to care Apparently they lost our order and like 10 others It was chaos Everyone was going up and asking for their money back The only reason Im giving 5 stars is because the manager Mashawna was super kind 
13659,5,Was very busy and fast paced But the kids loved it Definitely a change from our regular McDonalds Highly recommend the cheesecake 
24043,5,Hot fast food Good service
24045,5,

24047,5,Fast curious and food fresh
13655,5,Came around 9 pm and while it was busy they did not take long to have the food ready We used the touchscreen kiosk to order and they were super easy to use We got a pepperoni pizza and some alfredo pasta You can see them cook these which was pretty cool They have an arcade upstairs and the place has tons of places to eat

If you order to eat there and order pasta or the cheesesteak it comes on REAL plates pasta bowls  Thought that was neat

Not surprisingly  our fries were cold and the Big Mac was missing a burger pretty consistent with all other McDonalds on that point

24327,5,Some of the negative reviews Im seeing might be for other IDrive locations This one on the south end located near Sea World is always pretty good Its a well run establishment and seems a little more upscale than the others in the area Service is friendly although a bit on the slow side on my most recent visit but the Drive Thru was packed as this was on a Saturday night during a busy time of season in Orlando
24328,5,Updated review 2022 This really is a great McDonalds Maybe if you dont appreciate it you havent been around The grounds are clean I saw the manager Chris picking up trash around the store They wear nice uniforms and there was an employee cleaning tables as soon as they were vacant A very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders TO THE TABLE yall It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels nearby I think service is pretty fast 2019 Review I went here three times during my stay in the area and the food was always hot place clean and staff prompt and courteous Got a fabulous greeting Memorial Day morning
13324,5,Same as other McDonalds and somewhat crowed
13315,5,It was really nice that they had the outdoor seating open

24426,5,Nothing bad to say here We grabbed some quick breakfast before heading to the parks We opted to use the digital checkout to place our order which is pretty cool and gives plenty of options to what you order It also seems to give you a little more time to order The place was very clean and modern in design We didnt interact too much with staff but the little we did they seemed very nice and helpful Although not used this time by us I did notice a cart specifically for sauces seasonings etc right behind the counter for quick access when asked the location was pretty good despite being off a busy road so that didny pose any issues Overall a pretty food McDonalds experience
24429,5,Very nice staff good place to get all your fast food needs  Tha k you

24256,5,"My family and I stopped in here for a quick breakfast on our way home from a mini vacation

I ordered the oatmeal and a hash brown

An employee Nlnamed TJ brought our food to our table I noticed I didnt have the apple chunks and raisins that come with the oatmeal I let her know she went back and brought me what I needed

I then noticed the hash brown I ordered wasnt on the tray either
I let her know and she apologized then comes back with not one but 2 hash browns which oddly enough my young child decided after we got our food that she did want a hashbrown now She comped a free hashbrown
She was such a pleasant person to deal with  Her customer service and customer care abilities are 2010

I over heard he saying to another customer that this location isnt her usual location and she is a General Manager

She took care of evryone around us with an amazing attitude and a smile on her face which is a rare occasion

I hope she gets the recognition she deserves and a promotion or raise She turned a typically frustrating situation and made it a pleasant one Its funny to think that I we left happy even though our order was messed up"

14193,5,Fresh hot breakfast and friendly service Great visit
14187,5,My favorite thing that I have been getting from McDonalds is the chicken biscuit meal and I add folded egg and cheese that comes with a hashbrowns and a drink which is always half sweet and half unsweet And it is the best I highly recommend it if you want a hearty meal with meat and breakfast food So I highly recommend it

14035,5,This was actually the fastest McDonalds Ive ever been in for the drivethru I ordered on the app go to the pay window waited about a minute and a half got my drink then my food and Im finally I was on my way I wish other McDonalds were just as fast
14034,5,Gas station McDonalds adjoining but separate from the stations Timewise convenience store Bathrooms inbetween which were clean and multistalled Staff appeared to all be wearing masks which is appreciable given their position of making food for and interacting with such a confluence of travelers from farflung corners as they must Food quality was on the highside of McDonalds very small margin of differentiation Only hicup is that the space is not built for intimate conversations and since they dont yell at you over the ambient hustle and bustle I had some difficulty hearing the teller taking our order as well as though at a near table did not hear our order number called  hence I took off a star for ambiance in my rating here
14030,5,Best McDonalds menu and play ground area I ever seen in my life 
14028,5,Wow this McDonalds is different First of all theres 2 floors The first floor is essential just for dining and ordering It is very different than a normal McDonalds however Then on the second floor which you can access via stairs or elevator features a full fledged arcade and childrens play area alongside some more eating areas This McDonalds is a tourist attraction in and of itself For sure worth a visit even if you just go to see it because its pretty cool They also happen to serve McDonalds Pizza and Pasta too
14026,5,They forgot to give me cup for my coffee after waiting half hour And when I went to ask for refund They gave refund without any hassle and also offered free Apple pie for the inconvenience And they still gave me cup for coffee Staff are friendly Huge play area for kids
23693,5,The food at this store is always done right They seem to run a good kitchen Things are served at the right temp and 99 of the time taste great Unlike other stores where youve got about a 60 chance of great food
14025,5,You dont see a McDonalds with twostory anywhere until you come to Orlando Florida Just because of the size I forced my family for us to eat here They had a whole arcade area pizza line etc You have to check it out when you visit Orlando
23695,5,Definitely very good service I love the Christian music Very nice and clean Always love eating inside I give a 10 star rating Even higher than 10 as far as Im concerned 
14023,5,Best McDonalds Ive ever been to Good quality food especially for a fast food restaraunt This McDonalds also had a very funlooking game room

14071,5,Generally fast service accurate orders   This particular McDonalds is attached with a gas station and is often pretty busy but the line does tend to move quickly   I do often check my order to ensure I receive my order accurately  for example I get the ketchup or dipping sauce I askedordered with my meal and generally the orders are accurate  The lines may take a bit more time but again this particular location is at a busy intersection and the next close McDonalds is going to be in Boerne
14067,5,This is honestly my favorite McDonalds my food is always fresh the staff is always nice and I even get lucky and find a free cookie in the bag from time to time
14065,5,This McDonalds is always in the same place and its as good as any McDonalds ever

14063,5,Long line but moved quickly what else can I say its Mcdonalds
14058,5,Longtime customer This afternoon I was pleased to see the dining room open again with limited hours  I would like to point out that this particular crew and manager tonight provided most excellent service And the manager was great at keeping employees motivated which I dont often see elsewhere And the food was excellent Fries were just right and the Mc Rib was great Quite frankly this may have been my best McDonalds experience ever Keep up the good work

13835,5,The best McDonalds I have ever visited  It is nice and incredibly clean  At this McDonalds you can get both burger pizza and pasta something I havent seen at other McDonalds  On the first floor there is a large play area for children and an arcade  However one must be aware that because of the play area there is some noise on the first floor  But far less noise in the ground floor

13832,5,I was amazed that this was a McDonalds The wide variety of items offered outside of the normal McDonalds menu was impressive When I went some of those stations were closed but if Im ever in Orlando again when there are open I will definitely try them Can you imagine getting pizza from McDonalds or ice cream
13830,5,This was actually a pretty cool McDonalds Needed to experience it Service was quick especially with the amount of
13827,5,Loved the look of the store Kids had a good time in the arcade One part of my party waited over an hour for their food  Went to ask about it three times and was told it was on its way  The fourth time I went to the counter to ask about the order and was told that their system went down and that It had lost the order Little did they know that I currently work for McDonalds and I asked the manager how they were still taking orders if the system went down and no one was on the phone with tech support All of a sudden they found the order and rushed it to us I feel that what had happened is that the order was served off and no one wanted admit to it
23882,5,Always fast service picking up for UE or DD  Thanks guys
23883,5,Very clean place very precise very good happy to go there
13824,5,MCpizza is the best item in the menu

If you have little ones you definitely want to check this place out The Play Place is huge"
13816,5,I came to Orlando for Disney world and ended up coming to the largest McDonalds Ive ever seen I can proudly tell my family I got pizza and pasta from McDonald

13836,5,Food was good and service was great
13811,5,"Very loud and busy Very big inside with McDonalds pizza place too
Upstairs is a big kids play place
But you will have to wait about 20 30 mins too receive your order
So that a downside and its very crowded so if u have a problem with crowded places dont go inside because it alot of people inside ordering and waiting and its just to much"
13839,5,Different food options from the traditional mickey Ds but we went for the arcade Can easily spend a few hours here on a hot or rainy day and not break the bank
23865,5,Service is excellent about the food sometimes comes out cold
13885,5,The place was a little dirty and it took almost 30 minutes to get our food But they had a good variety of food My teens still want some more McDonalds pizza
23839,5,Nice and clean environment prompt service and order filled correctly what else could I ask for
13878,5,The food is good But they are understaffed and struggling to provide food on time It takes hours even to get a slice of cake or coffee  For pizza the wait time was horrible
23841,5,Quick service and a nice large parking lot yo sit and eat and watch the traffic go by
13874,5,This location is a joy I have been going here when im in Orlando for 30 years first with my kids and now with my grandkids The way it is laid out it is very customer friendly And the kids just love the play area and game room upstairs To this day the staff continues to be very friendly and helpful
13872,5,This place is crazy packed Our food came out at a decent time Its worth a stop to experience it  Just be prepared to be in a crowd
23846,5,Great service very clean restrooms Clean dinning room friendly staff
13863,5,"Even though the stars make no sense on my review the experience of a different McDonalds is definitely worth it

The place isnt the cleanest service isnt the fastest or most efficient and the atmosphere a bit frantic its worth a visit to have a pizza or decent diner breakfast from McDonalds Worth the experience"
23850,5,Consistently deliver tasty food and fast service
13861,5,"Multilevel place Loud but fun Like a ChuckECheese inside a Mickey Ds

Lots of games on 2nd level Plenty of tables Fast service Kiosk fairly easy to order  pay"
23853,5,Best place to grab a bite
23854,5,Good service Friendly staff Food was served fast and hot
13858,5,The staff treats people like an actual customerThere everyday practically doordash driver Amazing staff One thing I hate is having to mix my own flurry when they usually mix it up for you Other than that little flaw I definitely feel safe Welcomed No rude staff When their busy we have to wait a 1H for the food when their not we get our food within 2030 minutes Surely recommend bringing small kids to the play area
13857,5,Biggest McDonald
23857,5,Stopped for a quick breakfast to goThe guy inside was super quick and friendly
23858,5,Great service
13854,5,If you havent been here you need to see it Updating Review this place is still very interesting definitely bringing the kids food hasnt changed pizza is fantastic

23863,5,Always have a good experience when I do arrive
23868,5,Quick service
13808,5,Awesome McDonalds to visit and eat The food was delicious and the customer service was great You place your order at the machine and they will deliver the food anywhere you are I love the arcade area and there was plenty of seating The atmosphere was relaxing and restroomsfood areadrink area and arcade were clean They have 2 stories and both were very well maintained I definitely recommend visiting this McDonalds with your children They will have lots of fun
13807,5,It was to crowded but food was good and there are so many other options like pasta that you cant find in regular stores The second floor was amazing for the little ones with big playgroung and Arcade section Would love to come back on a not to busy day We visit Sunday at noon
23900,5,No spicy nuggets Fast and the girls are young n kind
13767,5,This has to be one of the best McDonalds I have ever been to hands down While disappointingly I did not visit the upstairs with the arcade machines I can rave about the pasta and pizza they make and serve The pasta can rival olive garden and starts at 1099 and you are able to customize it how you want Definitely would recommend both the pasta and even the pizza Im pretty picky on pizza and the pepperoni pizza was actually pretty good I usually would HATE brick oven pizza as I find they taste burnt always but this was a good pizza Definitely worth checking out at least once if you are in the area It is a little busy most times but even with that the wait is no worse than a regular McDonalds
23932,5,Best McDonalds in area Great staff
13763,5,Not much to say that every other review hasnt Very fun for something different Watching your pizza be put into the real brick oven at a McDonalds is definitely interesting The main reason you go is the novelty but the food honestly didnt disappoint The specialty menu items are a tiny bit pricey but fast food standards but they really are a tier above fast food Overall my fiance and I had a great time and I definitely recommend checking it out
23934,5,Great place to get Vegan products and entertainment while shopping 
13756,5,By far the best and most amazing McDonalds in the history of the world Its even hard to imagine it as a McDonalds Super clean extremely friendly and helpful staff A second floor with a massive arcade and crazyhuge kid gym shut down due to covid hysteria   Loved this place Bring your kids
23937,5,This mcdonalds is good correct order Good quality
13755,5,This is an amazing gem sitting on a corner looking not much like any McDonalds I had ever seen before   The second floor confused me but the logo looked similar to McDonalds  They have pizza cooked there in the restaurant  I know because my order was called before my pizza was ready  At any rate walking through the arcade upstairs was a nice way to wait for my pizza  I only gave 4 stars for service because the staff seemed to not be trained for customer service  Perhaps they were simply tired or busy but it wasnt up to the standard of typical McDonalds when I visited  I will return next time I am in Orlando
13753,5,Breakfast was hot and fresh They had an omelet sation with Belgium waffles
13750,5,This McDonald
23942,5,Good place to eat when u work third shift
23945,5,This one is always fast and usually gets it right the first time
13747,5,Obviously one of the most amazing McDonalds Ive ever seen Three stories and a twostory playland They had premium scoop ice cream and pasta with Alfredo on the menu Are you kidding me Pizza and Alfredo at McDonalds You betcha Biggest Playland Ive seen in the McDonalds for years Has it The classic Mac tonight guy playing a piano in the corner Has it Easily the best McDonalds Ive been to since I was a kid 30 years ago in Las Vegas
13746,5,Best experience ever The food was shockingly good I did pizza and build your own pasta Customer service was phenomenal  Restaurant was very clean and we didnt wait long on our food Cant wait to visit again
23950,5,Very quick and order was spot on
13738,5,The food was alright its one of the biggest McDonalds but quality can be improved with the fish sandwiches being burnt on the edges and burgers were not properly organized within the bun in the big mac just a bit of feedback compared to regular McDonalds restaurants Other than that my family had a great time enjoying the upstairs atmosphere and playground
23952,5,always good a little expensive but great fresh
23953,5,Very good customer service
23954,5,Always getting my early morning coffee  awesome customer service

23929,5,Excellent and very good people
23928,5,Super fast drive thru and nice kids
23927,5,Fast and friendly
13770,5,This McDonalds in Orlando is huge It was very busy but they were very fast The food was very fresh as they pretty much have to make everything to order Definitely worth a visit just to see them make pizza at a McDonalds
13797,5,Huge McDonalds Unique items at Orlando location Pizza and pasta Cheesecake was sold out Arcade but prize and play area are closed You can order at kiosk or wait in line for cashier Soda is not selfserve free refill Expect a long wait approximately 2030 mins if you are waiting for pizza and pasta its understandable though They do deliver to table I didnt see the Belgium waffle on menu
13791,5,We got out food VERY fast and they even have pizza The burger was a tad too dry but nothing I couldnt fix Service was fast for how busy it was Its also a very modern building
23903,5,Coffee always the best Good Customer service finally
13790,5,Really awesome experience A must when in Orlando Simple Its the biggest McDonald
13786,5,Chaotic has alot going on being the worlds largest McDonalds many options not on a typical menu examples being pizza pasta pilly cheese steak Belgian waffles and many more a giant arcade and kids play place on the second floor which can be accessed by an elevator
23909,5,I love it its nice i got the kid meal to it was great
13782,5,This is by far the best McDonalds  I love the options not on other locations menus  The pizza was wonderful and freshly made to order  I wish I lived closer because it would for sure be my go to fast food restaurant
23911,5,I love their ice coffee  I go 4x week for it
13780,5,We went with our kids and of course they wanted to eat and play on up stairs so a friendly worker brought us our order  but there was no station services on up stairs and the same time we had to go downstairs to serve our sodas look for napkins sauces and straws
23833,5,Food was excellent Friendly employees Restaurant was clean and so were the restrooms A

24459,5,I never thought I would rate a McDonalds as 5 stars but I did Food was typical of a McDonalds but the staff were truly incredible for a fast food restaurant They smiled checked up on us cleaned up our tables and looked far more professional than the normal locations
13115,5,First thing that caught my eye was its employees within the times Ive stopped by this branch of the Goldin Ark Reason being is do to its great customer service I understand most McDonalds now have self service available to its customers but the times that Ive gone to the beach in Santa Monica its always been alot easier to be attended by their kind employees
11984,5,Great food and great service
11983,5,One of the best mcdonalds I have been too We travel from Montreal to New York frequently and often stop by this mcdonalds The service is always efficient and quick Premises always clean Definitely a thumbs up especially considering how filthy and awful some other mcdonalds can be

11973,5,Coming from Quebec and its 1pm we stopped by for quick lunch Burger was of course very good and the place is very modern but what surprised me was the great service There was this McDonalds employee who was asking us if we need anything like soda refills or coffee This is the first McDonalds that I experienced this great service Go there folks
11971,5,I only went in to use the bathroom and get a refreshment but they were promoting Lobster Rolls So I ordered one One of the best Lobster Rolls I ever had It was very tasty and had plenty of lobster meat Besides all of the lobster meat my sandwich had the the full piece of meat from a claw
11963,5,"Hello

I was stunned to read reviews of this location on Google  Not our experience at all

My wife and I both agree that this was the finest cleanest friendliest McDonalds we have ever been to  dating back to the mid 1970s  Thats a lot of McDonalds all across Ontario Quebec and probably 30 states in the USA

We stopped on our way through for a quick bite at about 1130 am Thursday May 9 and again at about 130 pm Monday May 13

We loved the staff the patriotic decorations and just the overall welcoming atmosphere

What a place  Hope they keep it up"

13026,5,Basically what you want from McDonalds without all the bums and beggars in the store during the day
13025,5,Loved our family afternoon there
13024,5,Doing their best for no man and the food is still the same level of addicting  No drivethru and right next to the beach  It is usually teeming with people and it is usually a little busy  Kiosks available  On this trip the payment option for me was unavailable on the kiosk
13022,5,Good location very big place
13021,5,One of the Best McDonalds so far Good service
13014,5,Great place to eat awesome staff friendly and helpful enjoy your meal as youll be loving it

13009,5,"No drive thru enough parking Crowded but fairly quick They had the front doors open and I could feel the air moving not stuffy Mask optional at the time July2822 All employees were wearing masks All employees were pleasant or acceptably neutral and doing a good job Bathrooms and tables clean  Floors looked pretty good too considering the large amount of foot traffic Indoor and outdoor tables Whenever someone got up a worker appeared shortly after to spray and wipe down the table In person you can order at  cashiers or use one of the 8 selfservice screens I believe you could also order through the app Theres a scanner at the bottom of the payment pinpad
Didnt have to wait very long for my food Less than 5 minutes"
13004,5,Nice place even with the homeless around its clean and comfortable place The food preparation process is fast and the staff are nice I had tried the first tim
13001,5,Your service was excellent the employee Erica needs a raise because when I got there the lines were long and she cleared them out real fast thank you Erica
12997,5,Everytime I go into the Santa Monica McDonalds it able to handle the busy times In my opinion consider the customer traffic however they waist no time getting orders if you do not have a cloud following then you should get what you want Bathrooms have intermittent traffic depending on the busy time I see they want you to enjoy your meal in my opinion In the pictures you will available seating at a perfect time I was satisfied
12996,5,Good place Can get crowded sometimes but the service is quick I had a huge order and was served in under 10 minutes I love McDonalds quality so much This particular location is also right down the street from Santa Monica Pier A great place to eat before going to the beach
12995,5,Always clean place nice flow every time I
24529,5,This location gets super busy but the staff seems to take it allin stride They are all very nice and polite I had a good experinece here and would go back even though they forgot the pickles on my cheeseburger That makes the McDonalds Cheeseburger
24530,5,"Although McDonalds chain is known for it great customer service and fast delivery however this outlet is different
They are usually late in service even they are a very few customers
Moreover they have less no of options of eatables including snacks and beverages Sometimes their machines do not work and customers have to wait to make payment"
13036,5,Friendly staff and fast service
24536,5,Super friendly place Yvette was our CSR today and she was very friendly and helpful  Really clean too  which is surprising because its been raining for hours  Great location too
24502,5,I realize its fast food but I like it and go there 23 times per month I always get a 4 chicken sandwich meal I get a large drink and total comes to about 10 bucks Maybe a little high but the sandwich makes it worth it International Drive location in Myrtle Beach SC
24500,5,After travel around the world this is one of the best McDonalds The Manager is super kind and has the best customer service ever

24464,5,This place was freaking unbelievable  It has a elevator that takes you up to the game room where all the fun begins  The food was good I had the broccoli and  Alfredo I do recommend it  The large fish tank in the middle of the floor
13108,5,This place is a major tourist hub as it is located within a few blocks from the Santa Monica Pier Inside is nice They will also bring food to you that you wont see in any other store or this may be new to me since I have been to Mcdonalds only a few times in my entire life
13106,5,Only place that is open late night in Santa Monica after 11 pm Service great and you know the product Very safe and family friendly Great location
24470,5,Really nice place Best McDonalds Ive ever seen Milkshake was good too
13103,5,Gets very very busy  but they are normally fairly rapid about getting everyone through By far the cheapest food place in that area so ideal if youre just visiting Its still McDonalds though so dont expect anything different from every other franchise
13102,5,Great place to eat by the beach without the ridiculous prices  Beware that many homeless people ask you for change but never wanna change the sense of direction his life is unnerving to give people money as they bother while consuming meat patties between buns of bread with seeds Moral of this review is to never help homeless while eating
13099,5,The service the is great They do a awesome job with the food and it has security there so you dont have to worry to lose your chicken nuggets  and hamburger  also your money
13081,5,They got the best breakfast here
13071,5,One of the nicest mc donalds
24484,5,2am walked up to the drive through  the best nightshift crew and McD
13064,5,We usually go mainly for the soft serve covers and sundaes  Nothing hits the spot on a hot day like a small sundae  Prices are perfect and the kids really appreciate the treat  Hot fudge on the bottom really makes it fun for them
13061,5,Wonderful beachside McDonalds on Santa Monica Beach food is excellent and the restroom is open to the public until 11 pm
13060,5,Santa Monica pier is a few steps from here
24492,5,Fires were pie pan hot and the chicken sangwich was pretty deece Better than usual
13051,5,There was a psycho there but the guard tazed her
24495,5,"I have visited multiple McDonalds and I have never received a great customer service like in this location by the management  Great customer service great attention very respectfully
They even walk bu your table to ask if everything was ok"
13045,5,"If we focus too much on ourselves and the troubles in our lives it is very difficult to be happy Lord refresh my spirit help me let go of longing to become something I am not and show me how to be the best of who I am
Open your mind and empty your heart of fears so that you can know and experience God to the fullest Lord You are my peace my assurance and the love that I hold on toReach higher than you think possible for all that you want and you find that often you attain even more Lord I rely on Your promises made to each of us and especially on Your love
Be patient with others but mostly be patient with yourself Lord help me to keep a smile on my face and to realize my goodness and refuse to dwell on my imperfectionsDesiring more and more without appreciating what you have right now will never allow you to be truly happy Be grateful for the gifts you are receiving right this very minute Thats happinessGod gives abundantly to those who pass His gifts on to others Lord let Your blessings flow in to me and then out from me I will neither be selfish nor let my gifts stagnate
Use Jesus as your example on how to live Lord You will guide and advise us and then You will leave it to us to decide our own future Give us wisdom in our choicesDear Lord thank you for being such a loving God and caring about our pain You dont want to see us suffer You know the suffering that we face and I ask that you would please redeem it and bring it to an end In the midst Lord I believe that you are sufficient I ask that your strength will be made perfect in our weakness In Jesuss name amen"
13039,5,So busy Staff are literal heroes
13038,5,High traffic fast food restaurant that doesnt fail on being exactly just that In the process   however   it also us one of the few places in the area that offers a no frills area to eat your food AL FRESCO And in this day in age   thats priceless
24537,5,So fun The playground is HUGE Theres also an arcade and shopping inside My kids thought the elevator was neat to ride in a Mc
12981,5,"Theres nothing like eating a spicy Mc chicken at the legendary pier
The prices are good as always I highly recommend the dollar menu in this case 2 Mc chickens for only 4 The taste is very good For the price of course And the spicy one tastes even better Service was very fast but it can get very packed in the afternoon Plenty of seats and restrooms are available as well it gets packed too Pickup available The everyday McDonalds but placed in a crowded and convenient spot We highly recommend spicy Mc chicken with extra buffalo sauce"
24539,5,Good food Good service
24573,5,The McDonalds experience is that you can find the same on every single establishment but what really makes a difference and makes you come back is the way the employees treat the customers on this specific McDonals the manager Timothy makes such a good j

24593,5,The best McDonalds Ive ever been to hands down My kids could play in the play area for hours The made to order omelette served to me at my table on a China plate was delicious The staff are overly gracious and professional If you have been to Orlando and not stopped here you are missing out
12865,5,I love the food and the good customers service
12859,5,I went for ice cream for a late night craving and wasnt disappointed

24915,5,"Ive frequented this McDonalds at least once a week for the last year In times past I was fairly ambivalent to it It was just a place that I would go to get a quick bite to eat while I rushed off to some appointment or event

But over the past few months it has become so much more to me I know the pleather seats like the back of my hand I know the nuances of the quickorder kiosks I chuckle every time I see that little piece of gum stuck on the side of the drivethru wall I know when the fries are being made fresh I know and love that greasy sheen on the floor It is comfortable it is safe it is home"

24893,5,I have wintered in NoVa for the past decade  This McDonalds is the ONLY truly wellmanaged McDs in NoVa in my opinion and Ive tried em all the only one that at least acts like it actually WANTS customers to come inside  Things they do that other McDs often do not 1 free coffee refills 2 power for laptops 3 USB ports 4 bowl of McDs breath mints at counter 5 ample parking 6 friendly employees 7 CLEAN 8 updated 9 dont push the awful ordering kiosks 16 screen touches to order a coffee  please 10 very pleasant dining room lots of windows and sunny and they clean the windows constantly 11 nice bathrooms w hot water 12 comfy padded seating  I go out of my way daily to enjoy this McDonalds  Well done
