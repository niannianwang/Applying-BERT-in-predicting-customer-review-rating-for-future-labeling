7090,1,Ordered a number 15 meal for They somehow get the fries part and only thought I ordered nuggets and drink even though I had made it very clear that I ordered the Then they tried to charge me an ADDITIONAL for the fries which would have put the total cost OVER the actual price of the I having any of that and I guess they realized how ridiculous they were because they relented pretty quickly and handed over the
28038,1,Absolutely the worst They figure out the mobile app when asked how to fix issues with long wait times the ride staff just says do you want me to If you like people being rude to you and very slow service this is your place to not

6977,1,This one I find charging for a large coffee everywhere else it is for any size drink and the reason I go to at all is because of the coffee but if going to double the price of the coffee then I may as well go to any so I have to save this one particular would not lower the price when I told him that it was everywhere Arguing with a customer is not a good idea it would have been a better idea if she would have said going to let it go this time but no they actually try to argue the point and I think silly the whole reason that I come there at all is because of the coffee that is fairly good on a one to 10 scale I would say coffee is it seven or eight with Starbucks being a 10 especially when they suggest you get the expresso shot that is for the large coffee with the extra espresso shot from Starbucks and then creamer but that for dollar coffee is four times better than one dollar coffee so you get what you pay for I just think at that particular Stevens Creek location bites off customers

27955,1,I placed an order about an hour ago only to find out that half of my order was I called this location to let them know that I was missing half my The stated that if I come before 4am them have to wait until the next day to receive my Although I do understand that their menu items are schedule I think its highly unprofessional to turn their problem into I understand that my items were not available after that but she was extremely unhelpful in finding a solution to the problem they I asked to speak to a manager and was told the manager is on The call ended with her stating that she does not have time to deal with my problem because they are
27954,1,This was the worst been We ordered using the kiosk and they had numbers to pick up and take to your table where they would deliver your We waited 20 minutes for the food and it was dropped on our table without any The coffee I ordered was missing as was the cup for my He went to the counter to get it and they believe him at My coffee had the label on it for what ordered but it have any sugar in it so I added one and stirred took a sip and got a mouthful of The egg and sausage mcmuffin was cold as were the hash browns and the coffee was I assume it had been ready quite a while before it was Usually when I get this meal things are quite The whole thing was pretty dissatisfying and put me off for a The staff seem to be receptive to complaints so I made an online complaint on the website and we

24461,1,The worst in the I have lived close to this for a little over a year now and have yet ever had a good My order is either not accurate or the food is Also the team members and management just seem to not usually one to complain about things because I do realize this is a fast food however this last visit has really ticked me I even place my order because the person taking orders in the drive thru was so and then she wanted to act like she hear Other times I have visited this I have had an issue where items were left off my so brought the food back to have it all replaced because by the time I got home and had to drive back to pick up my missing it would all be I asked for my order to be remade and I legit watched this manager put my sandwich in the microwave I could understand if I had a huge order to be replaced but it was honestly 3 With that said I will not be back to this location

24466,1,Forgot to put the sign are
27956,1,I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular to in the This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney but still close enough to get back to the parks At that it was worth The menu was cheap at least what you know to expect from a international since a you know what the food is gong to be look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of You need to set yourself apart with your This WAS the reason I used to recommend this I think they care The last time we half of the kiosks One of the three that print plays a part into why the service was so Actually there was a lot that played into if gone to at all you know you pick your food at the get a number that you take to your pay at the sit down and wait for your Typically all of that takes about five this day what garnered from tourists and on many other the team at work decided they going to bring the food to the That would have been fine if there was any indication but of course that would have been a form of service so that After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together a slight we were told by other customers that were leaving that they calling numbers and you had to wait at the So I go up to the counter and We get our food 40 minutes and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get No big we are used to My are visiting and at this point trying to figure why they received their It dawned on me that my father have a receipt the machine that printing The person calling numbers is calling the number on the not the tent my food was ready in a master of minutes since that is all and placed in the If we said they would never have received their The lady never once called a tent We told another person of the lack of receipt That information never got transmitted to the person calling the When we spoke with her and told her their was no she asked us what the receipt number We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream and she asked again for the Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local not sure if they just staff well on this but like I talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a
27957,1,Hands down the worst ever Rudest Lady in looked like a manager and was infuriatingly rude and just a horrible The young girl at the register refused to acknowledge me turned her head and walked right by as I tried to ask for Other people and finished there food while I stood there unacknowledged for over 10 minutes waiting for 2 double cheeseburgers and a A guy was just leaning on the counter doing nothing and walked away when I said I could not wait any Never got my money back a

13089,1,No dollar menu anything but drinks Even coffee is 2 The service is spotty and confusing at The place is small and serves the end of the busiest street that leads to the poor planning on space for quality of There are a lot kf vagrants at this location but they are for the most part
27923,1,They were very rude and food was They refuse to let us inside and made us wait 10 mins for three sandwiches and when it was time to get the food two people were VERY Next time in town never go to this They were and not
24476,1,If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here The employee handling the front end was the rudest individual ever met of all my visits to in my 30 Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for One lady said been waiting on her food for over an They even accommodate her with a Infact my order took 40 min to The store shut down the as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the I understand easy to get overwhelmed but when filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an your prioritizing methods are And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant But if I were a they would have just received their last from my My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller in down town the management lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on fix this ladies attitude or find her
27929,1,Very bad so gross do clean up

13956,1,Believe me when I I love but this particular restaurant is truly Waited 30 minutes for my first very probably spicy chicken sandwich think with taking that amout of time it would at least resemble the menu picture in some small but They ALMOST managed to get some sauce in Slightly more would have helped disguise the taste of the burnt brioche I ate it for 3 reasons I was hungry I want to wait a further 30 minutes to be served up another burnt offering and the dead eyes of the staff threatened to haunt my dreams for all eternity and I just face the soulsucking experience of trying to explain my disappointment to them when they were all clearly in their own personal Take my if you decide to run the gauntlet of a late evening visit to this order the not a pretty decent if you have at least 30 minutes to wait for do yourself a favour and wander on to one of the many other restaurant choices in this part of Wish I

13794,1,Fries were nuggets were the burgers were the upstairs smelled sweaty and ordered food and the place was busy and my child needed to use the bathroom so I took the card with our number to the bathroom because I want them leaving my food alone at the table and they came over and yelled at us for moving around the honestly do not It is not worth Go find a regular and a park close
13793,1,Absolute free for all A automated factory that completely People waiting over 45 min for their nearly every order was and staff just literally ignoring the countless customers The manager had no control over his staff who blatantly ignored him to the point he was telling customers their names to This place simply work and is utter almost an and wrong with no one to care

6398,1,They charged a price to replace coffee with orange juice in the breakfast almost the price to just buy a separate notify me and gave me someone receipt when I asked for When I came back in 5 minutes to buy the I only got one and she refused to give me the

10771,1,My only visit to this shop and I witnessed There were two lines but suddenly one of the staff members stopped taking orders and closed the Those customers on that line were told to go at the back of the other I understand that some staff are new but the supervisor or senior staff are rude to the new staff and do not help train I understand the yelling because they are in Majority of staff speak Spanish and announce numbers in Expect some misunderstanding when they are taking your order One of the staff put in hot coffee when I ordered hot Be prepared to wait in a long line and always check your order before you leave the pick up It was my fault that I did not my Big Mac and South West salad dressing are missing when I just will always be a bad decision
25697,1,They was loud and had attudes and hanging all out the window my food was cold this was a bad place to eat at
10794,1,Place was not noticeable based on the Google maps I ended up looking for a while for it because it is missing the iconic double arches people I was looking within the mall area because of the map and wished I was across the street as it would have been easier to When I entered to place an one of the had an upset look or scowling face towards most and unfriendly I like her look so I stepped to the next cashier and I ordered it was I ordered a Happy Meal and was asked if this is for a boy or girl a toy choice I get the no And asked all they said was I not surprised by the lower than usual reviews Also when eating my food I ordered triple cheese burger but got doubles at least I was charged for double

10796,1,I know where to This is the slowest MCDs restaurant in the Staff act like if they were on You can see in their faces that they hate working here and are just looking forward to the end of their Manager came out after a while and there was no improvement in The automated order system was not working so I waited in line for 10 just to order and From this point it was exactly 27 until my order was All that was was a bottle of water and a mocha And I had to ask them otherwise it would have been more than half I reckon staff must really ask themselves whether they want to work There may be other better places where they could find job Here just turning a bunch of people into unhappy

10804,1,The food is average here like all nothing so bad like cold food or anything bad part about this location is that it somewhat seems to be a safe haven for bums and schizophrenic drug Everytime I have ever went here I am approached by someone asking for money or food its like they all hide in there and come out to beg when a new customer Last time I was there a bum with an injured leg was high on crack or something and scratching his open wound with the gauze completely miami filthy

12134,1,Very rude manager waited 40 minutes for our meal to have it handed by the manager practically shoving it at me and saying here
8742,1,At first glance the place looks good but the first quarter pounder was cold and when I watched them fix the second I found the the commercial about being cooked fresh is They pulled the meat from a drawer and it was barely warmer than the Then the flies inside were all over the last time I will come Right before I left a guy came in and tried to get some water and a rude sweaty security guard was stopping this place is not where I would take
25025,1,Repeatedly
8745,1,Fifteen minute wait in the drive They pull cars aside with larger orders to keep the line Predatory booting person roaming the probably be more comfortable with police supervising the exchange if you happen to get
26889,1,come to this mc They always takes forever to prepare your food and constantly passes people in front of you
8747,1,So in the morning obviously means something else to this No coffee made The jerk at the window have been more rude and put off that we were Today we were up early to start our long drive home after what was a very nice weekend in Salt Lake If this is the impression wants to leave I am happy to never frequent any of their 15 minutes from the time we paid til the we got our food in the drive through and two cars behind us got theirs ahead of All we ordered were two cokes and two sausage
8748,1,Spent over 20 minutes in line to be told that only serve breakfast at even though their menu said lunch Then told they were out of almost waste your time going here at gone two separate times and had seriously awful go a near and several gas stations with better service and better

12116,1,It was the worst service ever seen it took 45 minutes to get our food chicken nuggets Egg McMuffin and two drinks

17252,1,I got what I ordered wich was an ice coffe and one sausage There was no line how ever the attendant was not attentive causing my Check out time to be close to ten minutes for a very simple order I have to change my rating to one shortly after eating my burrito I got very sick to my
17250,1,Whatever you do NOT go to this a reason why I rated it one star and I can kindly explain While the food there is I simply cannot stare at these people the same way A hour or two I showed up to get some food and there was this one woman working behind the register remember her but I assume she was a manager or She was in a blue shirt and glasses and all I can There was an annoying beeping sound that seemed concerning and I politely asked word here is them to investigate it and make it They bother to check which shows that neglectful of the resources around their The reaction I got from this woman was disrespectful and told me to get out of her store and never come back and even tried to call 911 on pretty obvious that I caught this woman on a bad I was furious because I felt like she was deliberately trying to get under my skin and using that to her You know what they call people like A I was bullied by the manager because I had a concern that needed to be I was not trying to show up on this woman at any point during my I was trying to be as lenient as I possibly If the woman I was referring to was actually a manager of this she needs to be put in her place because NOT how a manager should treat her I do not like being especially by an employee and it really showed during this Come to think about been checking on other reviews of this location they all had numerous problems with this particular heartbroken because now I have anywhere to go to eat after my work only relegated to the a minute down the road and even I know they have better hearts and respect than this woman did their food is also As a man diagnosed with I strongly advise people to stay away from this location at all If you really need to go to a steer clear of this not worth your time and not worth your their drink machine has been broken and flat for at least a few months and they fix that I will be contacting corporate about the antics going afoot at this
17249,1,The absolute worst ever dealt The most incompetent management ever First 2 out of my last 3 breakfast orders were But realize until I got to I cannot leave my job to go Then today I got a and cheese Which was right with the exception of 2 long black hairs in I stopped back on my way home and asked for a The first manager only asked for a She then left and got another She was a heavy set black She was the most vile person that ever dealt Not even an Her response was to bring it 5 hours When I said that was she closed the window and walked I asked for a corporate phone number and she I called and I can only assume it was the same ignorant woman because she put the phone down and left it off the I called again for the phone number and she said its on my receipt and hung She is clearly incompetent and deserve her Funny thing is I ask for anything An sorry may have been But nothing even I would never recommend this dump of a nor the clearly racist I will stop at nothing now to make sure she treat anyone like this again
21487,1,worst ever customer manager is so rude dont even apologize for the wrong
17259,1,Ordered a burger at the I was made to wait for 20 minutes and when the food came I was given the wrong I brought it inside to talk the employees so I could get the correct I spoke with the manager and she was unbelievably Acted like it was my fault that my daughter was given the wrong I finally was given the right burger but I have no idea why the manager made it such an awful To top it I walked into the There was someone sitting in the He flushed and walked He was an employee and he wash his Just walked out of the bathroom and when I came out he was making

30170,1,If I could give this place zero stars I would after my experience here The employee handling the front end was the rudest individual ever met of all my visits to in my 30 Her attitude got her confronted by several of the customers waiting for One lady said been waiting on her food for over an They even accommodate her with a Infact my order took 40 min to The store shut down the as well as the drive through window to attempt to fill orders of those waiting in the I understand easy to get overwhelmed but when filling orders for customers that have just ordered while you have customers that have been waiting on food for nearly an your prioritizing methods are And combining that with the attitude of the manager on duty at the time will result in a lot of unhappy on vacation and will most likely never be in this restaurant But if I were a they would have just received their last from my My recommendation on would be to avoid the smaller in down town the management lacks in people skills and the whole establishment functions as a team The girl running the fries and the font end had better people skills and prioritized better than either member of management on fix this ladies attitude or find her
30169,1,This is the worst run I have EVER seen in my the service is super Its complete The manager should be immediately terminated along with the rest of the useless I would rate it zero but that an

23022,1,I want to apologize to anyone that I recommended this particular to in the This was the restaurant that I used to recommend to tourists when they were looking for a fast place to eat that was away from the Disney but still close enough to get back to the parks At that it was worth The menu was cheap at least what you know to expect from a international since a you know what the food is gong to be look at what you need to do if you are a member of a chain of You need to set yourself apart with your This WAS the reason I used to recommend this I think they care The last time we half of the kiosks One of the three that print plays a part into why the service was so Actually there was a lot that played into if gone to at all you know you pick your food at the get a number that you take to your pay at the sit down and wait for your Typically all of that takes about five this day what garnered from tourists and on many other the team at work decided they going to bring the food to the That would have been fine if there was any indication but of course that would have been a form of service so that After about 15 minutes of trying to find a place where we could all sit together a slight we were told by other customers that were leaving that they calling numbers and you had to wait at the So I go up to the counter and We get our food 40 minutes and there were the obligatory mess ups that we had to get No big we are used to My are visiting and at this point trying to figure why they received their It dawned on me that my father have a receipt the machine that printing The person calling numbers is calling the number on the not the tent my food was ready in a master of minutes since that is all and placed in the If we said they would never have received their The lady never once called a tent We told another person of the lack of receipt That information never got transmitted to the person calling the When we spoke with her and told her their was no she asked us what the receipt number We had the tent card in hand and pointed at the receipt plastered on the ice cream and she asked again for the Aside from the travesty that was the most important thing a restaurant is to the place looked like a slightly cleaned up version of a break room at a local not sure if they just staff well on this but like I talked to a few tourists and locals and they all say it had been this way a
23023,1,Hands down the worst ever Rudest Lady in looked like a manager and was infuriatingly rude and just a horrible The young girl at the register refused to acknowledge me turned her head and walked right by as I tried to ask for Other people and finished there food while I stood there unacknowledged for over 10 minutes waiting for 2 double cheeseburgers and a A guy was just leaning on the counter doing nothing and walked away when I said I could not wait any Never got my money back a

29977,1,rude half the kiosk malfunction and staff is not trained to help if it Managers are so busy solving issues with equipment they cant manage the High homeless people camping out Overall way to crowded and overpriced travel the extra mile and go to the next
15515,1,This is getting this rating not cause its but because time after it has been terribly poor I have had one experience where a manager told me that I was That clearly I ordered All I asked for was a double quarter pounder with cheese They took down a quarter pounder with cheese meal because likely more common than what I And instead of admitting they may have messed she told me I was wrong and needed to just accept I have been told that they only carry 2 types of sauce for nuggets as which I believe isnt I believe they just didnt know the other ones and didnt want to find I have also had large fries consistently only filled about of the Never once have I had a full large fries from
29974,1,min wait for food and order even Other people told me waited an Also some of the most unhappy families ever going to see in this Overall a consider starving

15514,1,Went to this location this morning around tried to order at drive was told I had to come once I went cash registers work they would only except cash which is not unusual because come to this location several times during the AM hours they will only except cash seems like all the time but after I FINALLY got my order this morning was pissed to find that my hash brown was hard as a WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO THIS LOCATION EVER

29982,1,What an awful Unless I am desperate I will never return
15518,1,The place The manager forced us to used the order which I hate If I have to take my own give me an employee Then a girl behind the counter told me their coffee machine was down then offered me a cup of regular coffee place of the I ordered for Then I ordered 2 apple pies and found cherry pies in the apple pie I was the told they only had 1 apple pie Instead of offering a I was asked I wanted I was given the incorrect amount back for my It was the worst I ever
29989,1,worst service
15525,1,Every time I go to this my order is always missing
29988,1,I really want to be and I typically do not leave bad But this experience this morning was absolutely I waited 24 min for apple pies that I know for a fact do not take that long to Restaurant looked to be short staffed which I understand and there was an employee there that was fairly new it seemed which was also My issue came with the TWO managers that were care of the Zero communication to anyone about what the wait was I deduced that I was waiting for pies because I heard the crew talking about These 2 managers were more concerned about what they were doing later and how one typically work Did not Apologize or attempt to communicate anything to any The worse part is as the food finally came up they tossed my bag to me and walked I hop that this is not typically how business is done there but my
15524,1,I guess my expectations should be Inside smelled like Management and staff were having loud personal conversations that included cuss Talking about how they were so ready to go home cant deal with this Among other One manager was on her phone while tending to Cashier was soft spoken and rude or Gnats flew around my food as I I was given my ice by the cashier from a bucket behind the There were no ketchup or napkins out for self serve so when I asked for them they were thrown on my It is McDongles after
29987,1,45 mins on a Thursday Nothing makes sense anymore with everything being terrible and no sense of urgency in any aspect of this Fire the whole crew from the manager on down and start
22796,1,Food was when we came a large family were at the cash taking kiosks so we used a regular kiosk and waited to pay cash at the When the manager came to take cash they gave a look like we were crazy then said you know we have a cash to which I responded that people are at It overly but execution was totally annoyed at us the Hope not like that next time we

21667,2,The were super
13549,2,Very small the coffee so very crowded
21133,2,The automated kiosks are This store is supposed to be fully but probably the reason why it just McDonalds should really look into the process and solve The workers are at the mercy of inferior I go into McDonalds and am instructed to use the There are some that some that are A customer instructs me not to use the one facing because I use the one on the other The process of ordering on the kiosk is slow and I have a coupon which I wanted to I first add the then scan the double my bad for not understanding the So now I have to remove the I add another and it takes me to the cart for some reason and says this all I So I add some more things and finalize my I try to check but I have no way to edit my order to select to no big just choose a and Please see a I talk to the McDonalds attendant and he tells me that he could find my order and that I can pay up During this I see and here about people sadly yelling at the McDonalds workers for messing up this automated system that not the McNuggets were They were but were on the verge of being Fries were looked like they were out for they fill it to the this was I felt bad for the workers here since it seems the biggest issue is problems with the kiosks and how orders are sent over to
24617,2,Not Brother bringing food food to wait and
12042,2,Not very not very not very The opposite of what could be a good On the plus they have high chair for

14765,2,They never have fruit punch for kids and i can never get a carmel frappe im just going to start going to another one im disappointed everytime i come here
24607,2,I would rate it a 1 star but people would not take my review I visited this restaurant last It was very clean including the At this time there was one cashier with a huge line and a bunch of people waiting for their The cashier was overloaded and the manager told everyone to order at the kiosks and not the This possible because nobody could pay at the they had to get a receipt and pay at the I left 20 minutes later and went to when the line had barely
22973,2,Says 24 hour drive always shut doing only systems are or some other reasons why they serve the early They post on the signa that the drive through is open just to not serve anyone or have it on maps that they are open just to refuse
16992,2,Too bad I only bought two coffees and it took me more than 19 minutes and they still moved me to the parking lot and then I had to return because they take what I bought with them lousy service
13472,2,Bad customer No beverage refill and no sauce
21135,2,This Macdonalds fell short on a good quality customer their staff was very rude to us and a few other customers on our day of they messed up on our order and we ended up eating 30 mins apart to my I was so Place was clean and you had to ask for a key to go into the we were in Vegas for vacations and we stayed at so this was the closest one to the 3rd day we wanted Macdonalds again and we decided to drive 15 mins

12970,2,Only good thing is their
22916,2,They forgot my ice cream but I went back and got The line is very long weekends so go during the The curbside pickup is I am appending my this is the second time I ordered and they forgot an This is beyond busy
14721,2,This used to be the best location for the freshest food but it clearly is not My nuggets were over done and I had to pour my drink out twice because it either tasted like pure syrup or water and I had to settle for something I want to Also how do you ask the customer what kind of sauce they want and STILL put it in the bag and got the nerve to catch an attitude when I ask you for I be going back to this
24615,2,New system of ordering at kiosks is Despite the most important thing to me being wanting to order with a human ordering at the kiosk took longer and was more difficult than ordering with a I wanted to pay cash which required I go to a cashier after ordering at the very the new fountain drink machines are equally I will never order a drink from a machine that dispenses all drinks from one spout because no matter what you dispense it always tastes like a mix of more than one Why has McDonalds chosen to fix what broken and use systems and machines which customers so clearly

22940,2,One of my favorite features of for me is that I know what I can This is true for this particular it seems that being soooo busy guess excellent makes them impervious to concerns about customer service or satisfaction of their Running out of running out many are Bad lack of well I guess that problem is on the The two stars are for do providing the best breakfast sandwich in the market regardless of attitude and bad
22939,2,Used a deal at the kiosk for a free kids meal combo purchase and when I went to check out it said is wiped out the order forcing me to everything and the deal code was now I get that they are for but if not a participating put up a sign or something so I waste my The drink fountain was closed keep the restaurant according to the sign so I went to the counter and asked for a refill and the manager said do refills Unlike every other gonna give me the saltiest fries ever and then make me pay for a if that is this But post a sign so that the expectation is set

23881,2,Lost my order while the place was almost Chicken tenders were
23703,2,The food was at But the upkeep of the restaurant was less than Garbage cans Foot prints all over the floor and the fountain drink dispenser Its had about an inch of fluid in the waste You even set your cups down to fill them
23705,2,Pretty much the definition of and Had the unpleasant pleasure of having an older lady by the name of Precious take my order and was just She had the worst kind of Worst I believe she was the shift last or Either if you care for the customer the food is usually on

11535,2,People are usually drunk here and the service people really dont like their
14015,2,Be ready for a 45 min to hr wait for For The line for cancelli ng orders was surprisingly
24764,2,Beautiful establishment both inside and out but the soda dispensers working and waiting in line to get drinks and ketchup sucks when other customers are placing orders and facing the same
12454,2,Too unfriendly staff
13817,2,We were given the wrong meal same more than 4 times while employees argued that it our food and been sitting here with our table number and corresponding receipt stating what we ordered for almost an hour still with no The outside looks amazing but inside is complete chaos the coordination and way of operating a busy business to get people their correct orders in this type of area with high population needs After 45 mins we got our Luke warm fries and the Sandwiches
23690,2,been going to this location most of my life since not far from my So seen this go through a lot of The employees here generally have decent there are a few that tend to be The store is also dirty a lot of the a very busy and maybe from having a lot of foot but the floor is usually the drink station will be filthy and wet and the ketchup area will be out of there will be ketchup all over the The tables tend to be you usually have to clean off your own Also they have those light up tables that kids and when I go in there with my kid there will be homeless people sitting and they be and have their stuff all over the place and sit there for And mind these tables seat about 8 and there will be one homeless person sitting My kid will want to sit there so he can play with the and have to tell him he because this one homeless person sitting at one of the largest is camping The employees seem to care at all that these people are doing this despite them sitting there for but buying Sometimes even be sleeping at the The play area is also really They have nothing for the kids to play on like a They have 4 of these really crappy touch screen games things that rarely work or at When I was a kid they had a huge which they took out when they remodeled the It even had at one along with the But they took it all out and replaced it with a place instead of a really all in this is has a lot of homeless people that practically live and really kid The food is as long as hot food get a lot of cold food or my order is and the employees are generally but there have been a lot of times where the managers are rather meaning that you can tell they want to be This location needs a lot of And they need to do something about the amount of homeless people that hang around in There been a single time gone there that there at least one homeless person there taking up the interactive table that kids want to sit with all their dirty things sitting on the table The table is by the front too and you can often times smell the homeless person sitting there the whole time waiting in line and waiting for your food and while you get your It is not kid friendly at all at this With the store being in a nicer part of town expect quite a bit more
11521,2,Not because of the staff or Because Too long a wait in lobby and drive
15691,2,Food was not fresh and the prices have gone
24767,2,The nuggets from this location were the WORST ever Unfortunately I taste them until gotten back to my otherwise definitely have asked for my money
14027,2,Come on this place is so dirty and try the pizza or but felt like I waS touching every virus known to My Big Mac was cold and no I was standing there when it was put
11525,2,They always get the order wrong in some way
25467,2,The service could be better they always forget to give you condiments and Even after Then soon as you drive You have to come back and go inside and explain that you were lied
17525,2,They messed my order
25466,2,Well it might have been if I was not but I still stayed for my For this to be they should know that busier during certain hours then were soo many ppl in the average person would have turn right back around n walked
13286,2,The problem is with these Mexican they have s Mexican customer they all know each after they chit when it they get better customer thsn the Whites that to me is discrmmation
12448,2,is
18499,2,Food always wrong and over cooked
23696,2,Get a veggie burger
13819,2,I really wanted to looooove this Mc Donalds store since they are the biggest in the But being this comes with a overcrowded and short People were mad in the line asking for the saying they ordered their meal 30 minutes This is Very tourist I just wish the manager would hire more people to work there so they can attend that much of
12443,2,Unorganized
21316,2,Prices are too high just because on the Strip you have to double your prices personally I think ridiculous why rip everyone off just cuz on the Strip yeah I know rent is more expensive But you get so much more traffic so many more It goes
21324,2,There was not a long wait in the drive thru but the food was cold and Fries un salted and cold fish sandwich was dry and Will not be going back
20469,2,Spent 20 minutes inline at the drive through and the iced coffee was still very bland and unlike its normal taste
13263,2,McDs in Santa But this is where people without means to afford other food around here a wild ride any time of the Ordering is always
13800,2,Largest in the they are trying to doing so much and doing none of it Four orders and three had missing No salt on the room temperature
22758,2,Food price is the most expensive Mcdonalds i ever
21367,2,Back in the day McDonalds was a treat you looked forward now the foods more the fries are never and the buns are usually dropped the
24713,2,Wait for my order over 10 minutes drive Deluxe with extra Fries where Had to go back inside to get fresh Looked under staffed
18249,2,This McDonalds They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this The The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good because you will always have to pull up at this Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times burger fry at 3pm pull up next to the other cars already The one manager had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes no and decided I just wanted it refunded to my The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me The best He made me pull up to get the So terrible a franchise for a this one just
13251,2,The management and staff argues with the customers and like a and highly prejudiced in quality of service towards fellow brown
16370,2,Used the app to but took 30 minutes to get it to me at the way too Tons of people got served before I did and my order was placed well before the other customers showed The only thing going for this place is that 24Hours drive And dont use the relaying orders to individual stores may have some this place is torn The building razed and the lot surrounded by I guess the bums from the nearby overpass finally took its Too bad cuz the 24 hour drive thru was pretty
11421,2,Food is has not been only luke Follow me on IG 77 Points
14116,2,Do close the dining room at 10pm or
18248,2,They watered their parking lot with a irrigation syztem right before days of hard everyone skate through the ice for a day before closing during the majority of the freeze when everyone needed a hot Whataburger stayed open and served a limited menu to support
20380,2,Started at drive thru and started ordering food at first able to hear the lady but after I order my first thing I could not really hear her and then when I got my food it was
18251,2,They seemed overwhelmed at lunch in Drive Very Then when at window was asked to pull forward when simply ordering a number 2 with nothing special a quarter pounder takes extra time to Now I remember why I dislike
23910,2,They now bring your food to your They forgot So my food was colder than
25512,2,The customer service is just not what it used to There is no Welcome to McDonalds just how can i I ended up payimg for someone elses At 1st i thought it was more but it was 20 cents glad i only go there for
14113,2,Consistently pre ordered thru the app No one in line in the drive thru took 20 mins to get my order While I watched car after car after car go thru the line I finally called in and and asked the status AFTER 20 Mins advised the manager was getting it now Wait what It was beyond COLD of down the drain And I ha
20385,2,get my order No inside I wish I could have tried their sausage gravy and biscuits but I am not taking that to
22370,2,I only come here for Diet and they take Wish that they would speed it up for drink only Always people loitering and homeless loitering
25306,2,Poor
23648,2,Unfortunately today while waiting in line to the side not in the drive through my frappe was given to the person behind She graciously take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with I waited 10 mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink I was very confused by especially in Covid I requested a different no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this
12525,2,Food ios but the drive thru linesn are
23642,2,food is typically put together however curbside is a minimum of 20 minutes once you pull Then hopefully you can get a curbside spot because the spots are usually full of customers theyve had pull forward and park to wait for their might as well go through the drive thru
16199,2,Poor
12535,2,I just wanted iced tea and a mocha They were just what I The service was seriously lacking how the drive thru person was rude and seemed to not be able to understand my simple order although we were both speaking English and it seemed to be the only language that they
11393,2,It was in the middle of being but the and food was worse than I would recommend staying away until renovations are and then give them a
13380,2,Hotspot for the Some people were very rude and bothering little This seems routine and manager do anything to remove these
15636,2,Frys where brown and hard and awful the hot and spices I got where but the frys where the line was long as well in the drive I woudnt recommend this
11796,2,Bit
16376,2,not sure wrong with this but half the time I go there the food I get is old and Today I went through the and they had a there were about 10 cars ahead of So not sure how they can serve me cold food when constantly feeling Just extremely disappointed with this I ordered a big Mac combo and the big Mac was cold and the fries were even colder
22258,2,Fries had a soft old nuggets not chicken burger was brownish and this was 2am but others on this island at this time are way more So nahhhh
21374,2,This location has NO sit down dinning I requested extra pickles and still got only 1 pickle per cheese
23639,2,Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate I am not sure if because my car is quiet or what but its mildly Never has my sauce order been Even when I pay for Even when I ask and confirm at the awkward confirming sauce and then having to ask for the exact sauce you were just promised was in the
13775,2,Food was standard They forgot our drinks for each person at the table and forgot our We had to go back multiple times to get They were out of the drink flavors once we got our
20366,2,Dont think we got a reciept We like to come to this place after because we got off around This just happened to say we ordered 2 a breakfast sandwich and a Instead of the Mcdoubles we got 2 At this point with how many time my order has been wrong I should just have to stop to the side and cuz I think we got a receipt
25523,2,Today June 2017 at aka my order was taking in drive thru I ask for Double chesse burger with no oins and no pickles with large sweet tea extra ice add So my drink had no extra ice or lemon and frys I drive home to eat my food which I stay 22 mints away from store it by my I get hone to open my bag to have only receive Hot Spicey and no which was not my order and young lady at both windows ready my order I have called the store 8 times to speak with manager and nobody has pick up the phone
11404,2,My experience of is this specific McDonalds according to Customer Service and Cleanliness of the restaurant tends to be on the lower tier of fast food restaurants around San
23915,2,Pictures are No way does that chicken sandwich is so big liar liar pants on
22760,2,at least you get like an hour of free
15643,2,They mess up my order alot and act like its my That and after midnight they want to take your credit Always claiming the system is
23641,2,so I went and tried the new Spicy chicken I personally prefer the spicy nuggets they are much more tender and fresh The Spicy Nuggets were Spicy add on the Spicy sauce and they will make you But mine were extremely dry and one had a weird rubber chewy piece so that was I can say I tried them but I was not
17455,2,typically get your order Check your purchase before you drive
16373,2,Employee at the first window was very helpful and he made sure my order was right however the girl at the second one ignored me and looked The muffin sandwich bread was stale and very tough and the hash browns were cold and also tasted like they sat on a shelf for way too After 2 bites I threw it in the trash and purchased a sandwich from a near by gas station much better from out of town and on my way to a meeting so returning an
20369,2,Asked for no pickles and I got a warm chs burger with pickles Nuggets were warm they forgot my My drink was all I think they are better at breakfast Geeze
25509,2,My family and I get to this we are shocked it looked so nice from the outside and they have the jungle themed play I ask if they have an outlet so that I may charge my laptop and phone and The here is not even strong I could not complete my Bummed Not the best as
14072,2,is good comfort food when you need a Still wish they could improve on customer service and adding ketchup to the Disappointing only because a multi billion dollar corporation that get the simple things
16363,2,The parking lot is one of the All the spots are way too narrow and
15655,2,The drive through cashier dumb as the My order was wrong 3x so u be the Good luck
11461,2,Slowest fast food I ever purchased and the order was timed was in line for over 17

12506,2,My burgers were made sloppy and the service was
18552,2,If your in hurry i guess
23656,2,The employees are great but the store manager is just a We have coupons with the The store manager stated that she really hoped that they would stop honoring because she was tired of having to ring then My wife and I went to the restaurant today she said the system was down and she would not accept them at going to try and avoid this in the near
15662,2,They made us wait longer than expekted but the food was good
22362,2,Limited expensive beach location without a public They make a huge deal about fresh pineapple with value meals but forgot to give it to Very young and disorganized Not what I expected from a
14081,2,Cannot comprehend why has employees posted in the drive thru lanes taking orders well out of view of the This just frustrates and delays customers for no If you are trying to be like facilities were not built to serve that operating model nor are your employees trained to work that way used to be a place to dash into for a fast meal but faster to go and dine inside most any other restaurant at this Food was up to standard and only reason I gave
20630,2,I just passed
17484,2,Long wait at the drive thru and cold
12501,2,Been coming to this Mc every time in the area never had a bad experience till I ordered a double quarter pounder with cheese by far the Greasiest Burger ever had in my life
15665,2,kind of slow and food usually taste that
24726,2,Only two power outlets in the whole place and the best one is at the Noisy and confused Not for business Has a 60 minute time limit on
12273,2,Slow service and mediocre food
24730,2,Quite literally one of the worst Staff is and get the order right or the food is As the manager of a 1500 room I advise all of my guests to detour this
14083,2,This is the slowest ever The staff is difficult to deal with and 5 out of 5 times our order is Great location and clean facilities
15811,2,They do not accept coupons from the
17480,2,ORDERED 3 items only got 2
20397,2,The food was but the service was I was even told to have a good night or anything like They need better customer service
21361,2,Mcds is expensive for the type of food and how they treat the I ordered sausage hash LG c9ffee my total is plus tax under sorry but mcds make billions per day and steals even Going 2 manager people needs 2 be more aware what companies are You say only but it happens all the And the companies is the only one who Just
22368,2,This is by far the cheapest place to eat at Waikiki that also makes it a very attractive spot for all the drug addicts and homeless of the While I generally mind homeless eating next to a meth addict on a bad trip is not the most pleasant Not one star since you can get sick full for
23908,2,As has been for the last year slow Went inside this no
14103,2,Normally I would rate this with a 5 but lately this location has been having a lot of staff I just left today and I asked for pancakes with sausages and added bacon to but they forgot to add the sausage which by the way normally comes with the So I get to work to the surprise that I paid extra for something missing in my The place and the but the coordination with the employees and the supervisors needs to improve a
18570,2,Not a
13253,2,The employee at the register was so greet say like if it was went to get a refill turns out they give Restroom was about
14100,2,The ice machine was out of had to wait several minutes for my breakfast due to all the online orders waiting in front of service was really They obviously have a labor issue at this not enough people working at this
18568,2,Lines too long
24720,2,The service was awful and They messed up my order when trying to get it fixed the manager had and attitude even though I had my receipt to show I wasnt
14096,2,Very poor While on a long road trip we stopped in to get gas and Upon entering the the floors were extremely but we came after lunch so maybe they had a busy lunch Then when I stepped up to the counter to the menu screens were stuck on frozen 2 Then I order 2 Caramel Mocha After about 3min of waiting the kid behind the counter tells me the machine broke he needs to get the Come to find out the machine is on and it will be 18min before our coffee is Not wanting to wait around they tell me they can give me two regular When I tell them that regular coffee is a cup and I was charged for two specialty coffees they offer to make up the difference in nice and but we did not want nor need any I ask for just a refund at that Mind you this whole ordeal takes almost the 18min for the machine to finish cleaning but by now I just wanted to get out of The staff were all very young and seemed very poorly While they were nice and tried to make it I think better training of the employees at this location is While waiting for my refund I watched multiple other customers receive the wrong order or had issues with their I dont often go to but continued visits with poor service has definitely left a bad
14095,2,It was ok but they bag my happy meals and my nuggets and and no drink holder 3 drinks and a shke so it all feel out in the car and the shake stained my seats but happens right
22692,2,No bathrooms and no smiles lucky my kids like the food
21201,2,Slowest mcdonalds ever been Been 30 minutes and food still
20392,2,I had to spend the weekend Hate that as I might McDeath was doing fine with my ice which I admit I am Until Monday I got that 1 McDeath manager who thinks they are in charge of making sure this dollar Corp gets its whether they are asking for it or McDeath has a great
24375,2,They certainly need to take a look at the way they are staffing the night This location seems to be very popular at night and yet the management has barely anyone back there making There was a giant mob waiting at the for their Be smarter with your
14091,2,I have to do this cause upset with as a former employee but also a business partner you can call Doordash a business They pay so the employee turnover rate is high or they just show they have seemingly no limits on how many delivery and mobile orders people can place so they get and keep I told them I had an order and they said to get in the drive By the time I got to the they even started the It took 20 minutes in I lost money waiting on reformat your business It was embarrassing working here and apologizing for the ineptitude of this Be nice to the not their not even sure the but they have to tell their higher ups about
21202,2,It was stressful watching everyone and The lady ordering a frappuccino and getting mad that they have frappuccinos seemed like a person I would never want to be friends Felt sorry for the guy working the register for having to deal with that demanding But the food was
22755,2,Long lines but pretty fast service
11458,2,under Took way too long to get our

14140,2,Drive thru not You might as well go in and Placed our order at finally came at There were 3 cars ahead of us still waiting for their When you are in a hurry pass this one At least they are consistent with their The food even Tired of giving them
20472,2,What ever happened to fast service and hot food you get neither at this place
23708,2,Everything Very but I ask for fresh fries the spanish manager there wanted me to stay with warm fries I said fries are fried in the should be taught to say give us a minute your fries will be fried at the because the customer is very important for
17599,2,Fries were too salty
23783,2,The food is The price is If you go through the drive they always make you pull forward because your food ready
18326,2,Rude on the drive thru speaker and at the window the only postive was the person who gave me my She was very kind and polite to

23812,2,Very Drive thru line was wrapped around the building so I went in to Took 15 minutes to get a cheeseburger and
16254,2,Poor
17650,2,Unity
21222,2,Very slow and poorly run Has potential to be a great location with great But the management is horrid and help is not helpful and pretty much clue on what is going Ordering takes for ever and food even
24874,2,Horrible You could tell the food had been I asked for and it was the The milkshake machine is never or they say they are cleaning They clean it at the wrong I DO NOT recommend this

13852,2,Slowest service on Atleast cars left in last 30 mins while I am waiting on drive If you can staffed appropriately and efficient folks can make thousands extra without doing anything Just process order with some speed and sense of Very slow I wonder if top management is aware of how slow is the food service in general at been 50 mins in drive thru still no There are only a few unique items on the menu and this i

13877,2,Too wait hours in line for just go to a regular not worth the wait Waste of time in Arcade is also small and not worth go to a bigger and better
23842,2,Very very slow in the mornings and employees are not too friendly
18370,2,How can this place change staff so often and guaranteed to get tour order wrong
24879,2,Unwilling to keep someone at the I had to yell after standing alone over 2 minutes to get their attention
22321,2,Your Covid rules are In your effort to keep everyone safe you bunch everyone up either ordering or waiting for their Your restaurant is plenty big to separate people out use
23845,2,They seemed like they gave me old food and the fries was to hard and the buns as well
11712,2,Crews are not
21233,2,Quick Burgers were barely A lot of aggressive homeless people in the A woman approached my son and I while we were dining inside and you mind sharing some Never
24885,2,Still a good place to go but it seems that the management rather serve than inside Having to wait for the to finish before waiting on inside customers makes you want to go somewhere else
12318,2,Very slow in the evening hours
24882,2,Customer service When I get to the 2nd window no talking they just hang my drink out the window and then shove my food I ordered a bacon quarter pounder plain and I get a mc double with extra mac 2 times in a row my order was messed not
11702,2,Horrible customer service
21231,2,Not only am I not a big fan of fast food joints but absolutely opposed to filth in any And filth is what I experienced at this The staff who waited on us was and and the food but the restaurant itself had empty sugar and creamer packs laying Reason there as no place to throw them I am advising you to avoid this
16263,2,Poor
18348,2,Only had 8 nuggets in my box and the fries were way past shelf
20570,2,Pancakes cold and And computers were down
23851,2,Fries were cold and seemed like they were dropped back in the grease after already being cooked so were the

11696,2,Really Slow
13333,2,Not to much of a fan of the menu but some of the ice coffee drinks are This location is always busy and full not the cleanest

18382,2,11 minutes between order and then 5 more for the rest of the hash browns sausage muffin nothing extra or fancy
25377,2,When this first OMG it was cool seeing the zoo The animatronics made noise and The service WAS But now it looks like a tourist Some days sit at the drive through line for a long time then get told to wait in a parking Whoever owns this franchise should be proud of it and maintain quality that it As far as the food Well same as any
24319,2,Chicken nuggets were ice cold and disgusting the French fries it was like they poured bucket of salt on This is not the first time encountered cold overly salted food
18345,2,My wife watched the lady cleaning the bathroom take the mop bucket straight to the lobby where she mopped the floor then the bench where people Same same same
21242,2,After ordering my food and waiting for over 10 minutes to get Coffee was luke I went back to get fresh cup and I was handed a cup that had been sitting on the I told the young lady that it hot either and she said that it was the normal temperature of their I finally got her to pour me a fresh hot This is definitely not the place to go to for
11688,2,Coffee is average and to sweet
16270,2,Poor
12325,2,Good for a quick stop
24876,2,About half of my visits are pretty terrible but a drive thru option on my way to Today my egg and cheese had no for a missing ingredient is absolutely
13883,2,This place was with Covid right now no one had control of There was not spaced out People were on top of each None of the employees seemed to care that there was no social I was expecting some type of Covid policy to be in place and there was for But they seemed to care less about the people who I will never be going back here
13331,2,My visit was just to get a gift and this location is very Not clean in the dining room area at
17624,2,Decent
21238,2,Not the best Manager was very rude and rectify the which ultimately ended up being a customer service and quality of product She could have easily made it right but failed to do I will no longer visit this McDonalds and I urge others to avoid it like the There are plenty of other fast food restaurants in the area that are worth
24877,2,been ordering from this location via Uber Eats for a couple of They are no longer able serve an acceptable Breakfast NUKED TO THE PAPER It be their business training EVERY TIME all other items are fine except for this

20516,2,They always seem to make you feel like you are inconveniencing them by being
18302,2,We go to this McDonalds because they had a really cool electronic board that the kids could play on it was interactive and very neat well for the last five times they tell us the board is we only get a drink there so we only go to for the play area and since broke my son has been very sad
13987,2,I thought I had experienced a few disorganized before This is a whole new level of bad One hour wait time for a normal order plus a The employees seem to all be very busy and there are plenty of them This leads me to believe management are not equipped to handle a location this size and either needs training or needs
17662,2,It was cold in there
12402,2,Ok
24806,2,Took an hour and a half to get food but friendly
13356,2,I had a fly in my mc i got yelled at about it im last i checked the customer was

18447,2,The fries were not cooked some were still ice cold
24814,2,Slow service and attendents acknowledge ate there multiple times since it was close to where I was saying and could get a quick bite to but it was slow

12387,2,Extremly slow
11605,2,Service and food quality are inconsistent
18313,2,The manager did not have all the equipment working the order was messed up and they did not have the option to do Google or Apple pay or take credit cards or scan anything on the

18421,2,They are fast but they almost always screw up your
11639,2,The McRib started my downhill
24307,2,Every vehicle that ordered was told to move into a parking space to wait for their Why not just allow everyone to wait at the window if service is so The other thing that set me off is they had a lady in her late bring the food She did so with a loving warm smile but I only hope they take care of her when the younger fit employees clock No offense she was a sweet heart just
11640,2,Same consistently
16296,2,Cashier on turn at pretend hear when when I asked twice please repeat the just told me go to the next of course the order was wrong

13972,2,Very nice but the reason writing this review with 2 stars is because of the fish They have a fish tank here overcrowded with African an aggressive type of fish who will chase each other nip at each other and other and sometimes even kill They have one Bala which is a very peaceful schooling fish who should be in a group of at LEAST 4 other Bala fish can die from stress in some cases if they are He is being nipped his fins are and he gets about 16 inches long full There are Plecos that also get about 24 inches long full grown in there I know who was in I asked but apparently someone comes in to take care of I love the staff I just want to make sure their fish are being taken care of and be very happy in Keep in mind the rule of fish is every inch of fish about how big they will be full should have at least one if not two gallons of water to swim around The cichlids alone get anywhere between and I even count how many there is in Bala sharks are schooling fish and get about inches and Plecos get about 24 inches and they get very wide as V
24336,2,This particular was incredibly My chicken sandwich was overcooked and dry and they put the pickles on Overall it took over 15 minutes in the drive through to get my Not a great showing from a place that is not expected to be

17418,2,Bought FOUR items here and they forgot I am still confused as to how you can mess up on only four After this I am really concerned about our education

20324,2,042321 Tried them again in a rush and was insulted with a terrible attitude because I added a tea to my then she walked away with my credit the large cup had black finger prints marks on and gave me a scorched and cold egg Mcmuffin The hashbrown was also I ordered a bacon McGriddle hash brown and a senior She thanked me and stated my When it aligned with normal I had to ask if I would do better ordering it as a That reduced the price very but made me wonder why my server at least offer to check the price to help I decided if paying for my take it on the When I got my the bacon and the hash brown were just so loaded with The sandwich was sweet dough and the hash brown soaked through the I know serves fast but this made me feel like a heart attack was going to happen if I ate I rarely stop at McD but I was running and The experience reminded they are not emergency they are emergency room
24696,2,Pretty cool but drive a 4 hour drive to for the cashier to catch a attitude wi

16417,2,The drive through at this has always been busy every time honestly worth driving a little extra to another location if you are in a been stuck in the drive thru line for over 15 minutes on several occasions just ordering a single compared to In and Out but this is That the interior has always been pretty clean when went If you go for breakfast on the once be prepared to They do take Apple Pay and Android The one time I used the person behind the counter actually knew what it So many places tell you they have it but just know what it Another big plus is the drive through is 24

11278,2,I went for an ice cream cone and always A lot of times they have ice This time they were cleaning the machine in the middle of the just No ice cream cones or milkshakes or any other ice cream products is known for this Not just this I eat their food because most of it

11283,2,take very long to get but the person taking my order speak a single word of English so she had to ask for help for everything I She was being trained at the same time but even talk to I understand Spanish is needed sometimes especially in Southern but when busy and the only one working the register and the main language is what are you going to really going to happen is going to restrict what your customers are able to I order the same thing every time I decide to come to McDonalds so I have no complaints about the but this time it compelled me to write a Was an uncomfortable situation
23612,2,Cold Double cheeseburgers were not hot and the cheese The were dumped on the top of the mcflurry and some spilt is expensive for my meal and a happy meal for my Then subpar at
12619,2,Slow bad area after not very safe to eat recommend drive the food is consistent for the most the staff is ok but can be getting in and out can be not the best place for a date or ideal for a quick stop and go
21187,2,The food was hot and fresh but i could not wash my The manager and crew was like the bathroom dirty so you cant use it yet no one went to clean They offered some sanitizer wipes but you cant sanitize nothing thats not to eat my food with a paper

14198,2,2 stars instead of 1 only because it could always be just Double quarter pounder with just warm tending towards cold and the meat looked really like I would expect a black bean burger to look like The mayonnaise tasted slighty weird I thought it might be miracle whip for a Shares a fairly nasty restroom in the hallway between and Over for this junk is
13737,2,I think I had much higher expectations of this because I was strongly suggested to I expected a 30 foot statue of Ronald McDonald and it ended up being a lackluster 30 foot lighted outline of Ronald on the The picture online of the building made it look like it was made of a French Fry building It They had a separate drink station where you gave them your drink order extra step because no self service ones They had a separate dessert and a walk up food counter to order or kiosks to order where they will serve if you eat in not the soft It is 2 The 2nd floor is a play area which I expected would be huge and a small arcade The menu showed some items different from other but of them showed OUT OF So we just ate the kind of food you could eat at a regular only it cost MUCH unexciting and not what it should be for being the LARGEST
13388,2,2 stars because I had to dodge beggars and also because I got charged for a that must be a California but uncalled
11287,2,Even though they renovated this place a few months the homeless still call this place I cant ever sit inside without hearing screaming or seeing someone passed out on the floor And the last few times i had to inquire about my order because they forgot about If go through drive thru
11289,2,Staff were arguing amongst themselves whether who does Managers were indifferent to employees and with Ordered two Happy Meals and a McFlurry and about 6 customers after I received their orders before We waited around 20 minutes or The McFlurry was supposed to be the Stroopwafel and there was hardly any in it was vanilla ice
13740,2,A different experience worth We had a good time trying different menu items not found at any other Definitely worth a visit if coming to Not the same as it used to The selections are limited and not as international as it once It lost uniqueness and it feels like just a regular busy Not recommended

7632,2,What do you think my hamburger went against the receipt of the what do you
27653,2,my local so I wish I could rate it higher especially considering they added modern stuff like the DIY menu boards and the 2nd drive thru But the point of a second drive thru lane if your employees just ignore it like what happened Also while they have security inside the pan handlers in the drive thru lanes at night are out of Food wise things take a long time usually but your normal type food except they salt their fries
27657,2,This has always been as far back as I can and a sleek change the fact that a visit to this will leave you with a bad taste in your The list of their offenses is too long to detail every so compile a Incorrect orders of the time Rude employees and managers Customers who are and downright violent Poorly food And perhaps the most disgusting new violation is that recently they claim to have leased their parking lot to a private booting Parking Boot and troll the parking lot for people who step off the property to boot them and demand cash in exchange for the boot It seems this is doing everything to lose They thrive off of convenient location Absolutely terrible
31725,2,Construction everywhere makes this place a mess to visit

31691,2,Food was okay cashier was rude and they have
27634,2,absurd how bad the service is I recommend going through the drive mess up your order and then make you wait a long time for it say just ignore this entirely but if you do come to this do yourself a Park the car and order your meal inside the fast food be faster this
27631,2,Service and the food here REALLY been there a few times after work which is after and always end up kicking myself in the ankle for doing my order is NEVER chicken pay for some cookies or apple and not in the and to add insult to the food that does make it into the seems like its been sitting around for to save a buck mickey skip this place if you trust

7692,2,Poor
27600,2,The apple pies here were the It was like biting into a regular The only thing cooked was the The inside was cold and the apples were I went there to get happy meals for my daughters and their fries were too hard to I be going back I only went to reward the girls for cleaning their room and helping around the house for 2 was their choice of reward for good
27602,2,With as much staff as was on hand there is no reason I should have waited longer than 30 but I I was not happy with my order when I got Nor was my body satisfied when it went If you want to try this place knock yourself

6967,2,Absolutely done with this I always seem to get the same woman at the I know her name but I know her voice and she screws up every single time then when I try and correct her she gets mad and acts like my I know if special needs or something or a learning disability or if hard of hearing I get And even lately when I hear her I actually make sure to enunciate clearly but it seem to The young man that I occasionally get is always on point he has never messed up an guessing she is related to management or has incriminating photos or She has absolutely no people skills and I will not go back to this place

31440,2,My fries were cold all I and took 14

27976,2,Female cashier was rude and was very If you are a tourist and know when it is cash only you get a receipt do not yell at the customer like we supposed to know what is going The only good thing about going was lemuel he was a great I would not want the girl to serve us with that

27958,2,The only reason that I stoped to buy at was because of my youngest But what we experienced today put an end to The employees at this location did not maintain an order serving customers in the drive thru As you there are two lines in the drive thru and they are supposedly serve in a first come first serve basis but that was not the The instead of been talked to us in a not too pleasant I did not wanted to make things worst so we placed our order and moved on to pay and pick Luckily the manager was close by and had the opportunity to address the I hope they take this opportunity to improve their customer service skills and provide customers a much pleasant
7237,2,I dried going to this This place messes up more times than getting it Bad
31489,2,Slow service and the food was wrong not once but Complete waste of time and money

1861,2,I did the Drive though the food was warm and it was turn off
8616,2,So as of the past month or they close the store randomly to save face and not overwhelm the low count of night staff they 1230 in the no line and the kid working says going to take an When I knownfor a fact it takes about 10 to 15 I had placed an order on the app using my free Looking to get a quick bite on my Sunday night walk home from my usual business and now down from 2600 points to 100 STILL Yall lucky you get a 2 update I now have 1600 points yall need to properly train your staff and quite frankly I think you should just overhaul the entire place with new staff because what you have

1450,2,Poor
32416,2,I like the new design but the customer service has gone down Way too many employees go there on their day off to they hang around the registers distracting emplyees who should be focused on their stations and tending to The worst part is that one of the managers young latino was engaged in of these I asked the manager why he controlling his staff and he just looked at me and
8907,2,what do you
32410,2,They mess up your but you will sit in the drive through for at least 15 20 minutes before you get to order and then wait another 10 minutes to get your Overall unless your only you should drive on to a better run

32395,2,Bad costomer service slow workers
1596,2,Poor
8801,2,Its an average And i would have rated it 3 stars or But there is always A rude and sometimes and literate security guard who in morning speak any English the only English he does know is typed on his cellphone which he charmingly shows you if you buy something quick enough he says if you buy something get out then at night another security guard that that much better he does speak English but again all he ever says is by something or leave
8799,2,not sure what anyone who has lived in Utah expects when trying to dine in this pretty common knowledge that downtown is the heart of the homeless and many drug Not to mention this location is one block from pioneer park and very close to the road not excusing any rude or bad experiences but maybe just a bit more patience and fast like the Dine
26880,2,There is an upon entering and exiting the drive LOL
8695,2,First and last time to this Had to stand around for 20 mins aside from only 2 people being One employee caught an attitude when i asked for no None of the burgers were wrapped And they were so lazy about they job that at first they even come to the register to take my Kept staring at me expecting me to use their damn Customer service and being polite goes a long way And learn how to wrap your

8671,2,Good but I had told the waitress not to take my tray and I had to go out to get a portable battery for my Upon doing the security officer harassed me about smoking when I had not lit my then waited for his instructions when he started to speak it was in espaniol and he pointed toward the I was somewhat confused and a bit worried about my Coffee and a set of my question is Make your restaurant so user friendly and then harass patrons after a good dining
32247,2,upset because they put an egg in my
32246,2,Comfortable and play The service is very
1697,2,Poor
32223,2,Its

8649,2,We went through the drive thru and to start it took too long for anyone to come over the speaker and then they were quiet and hard to One of the things we ordered was number He was asked what size he wanted and what to drink as part of the They give us fries with our combo meal and when the manager FINALLY noticed me he gave us a medium fry not the large we
26928,2,Very dirty and friendly at They act like they like their jobs

32284,2,Got me waiting for to long to take my order
8627,2,Dine in experience was really not Went there to have a nice breakfast out and the cashier got into a screaming match with a and other customers got Bad vibes all Food was fine as pretty much the same I drive twice as far to go to a different even though even offered right
8708,2,Was forced to use the If you need to pay in you have to still use the kiosk then go the the cashier with your receipt and Check out takes a lot more the food is not prepared any and the dining room or bathrooms any So there is no advantage to the
8715,2,McDonalds was the people I went with But honestly this place is really they even have a security guard at the front door in case things go If you are wondering HOW things could go you have to expand your view further then the amount of druggys that go to this Half of them even buy they just stand around heat up I waiting for the security to kick them The other half stand in line and figure out that they buy anything at the front desk then Normally I have a problem with this if they kept to themselves like everyone else ordering something at the but they would randomly ask pan and just were being a general I understand that an establishment control who their costumers so not exactly the but still this Micky should be avoided at all costs for that I give them 2 stars instead of one because the good customer service and magically clean Seriously these cashiers have to deal with a lot of weird stuff and they somehow mentally broken by the end of the I went at 11 at night which probably affects my but from the first impression not inclined to go again to find out how it is in the day unless it was simultaneously the only I was starving more than a communist in the and I lost my ability to cook food Seriously go here
32308,2,It was clean and we order from the touch screen The place was small and not
8792,2,Tell me how I end up with a double cheese whose resemble a sloppy My hamburger looked like they cleaned up the grill of all the pieces and threw them on a But I got it quickly and my coke and fries were good so I gave them 2

32305,2,Service was all great but it was dirty all it had a very foul odor
8768,2,They get you in the drive I bought big breakfasts and made sure I got the syrup and The employee rolled her eyes because I seemingly
8764,2,Fast fast Low quality you will probably already know that because it is a and not a whole foods Cafe organic The food price is above normal for what you are the value is low in the area of food quality for the What you are paying for is They have a very fast
1612,2,Poor
8749,2,Picture a mcdonalds in a pretty rough They have a security You need permission to go in the People are Seems You expect it to be the best The staff seem friendly for the most part and my food comes out fairly fast tastes decent I have noticed the buns are stale slightly around the edge at this location more than I had that happen at any others I wonder why that
32301,2,This is NOT Maybe Fridays and Saturdays but at the time of this review It is not Staff still inside and not takong orders
32291,2,Third time coming and third time been served after a long Often there is not a line yet there is still a Food is good like at any other McDonalds but the service is so
8729,2,The service was Got through the driveway quickly with the right order but as I was leaving a homeless person tried running towards me screaming at my dog

26899,2,20 minute wait for 2 egg
27115,2,Limited parking and alot of traffic
1867,2,Decent but I would prefer avoiding this especially at certain times school Lunch And some it is packed with unbearably loud and annoying sometimes even There are some nice but the order is always Food is consistently good
1873,2,Always very gone to this for 15 years The system has gotten more organized since the recent renovation but it seems the efficiency still has not The workers are nice and willing to The seating area is much The biggest issue would be the lack of efficient seen people leave after ordering because it would take so Hopefully be
27429,2,Food was Everything was but they never have any of the toys offered on the mconalds preorder app exept for what they call which is really just for and were very short with me and rude when i asked for a proper toy for my little 2 yr old She is obviously not into a

2167,2,No refills on drinks owner keeps ac on low making it hot School kids sit at all seats taking up space and are
27440,2,This McDonalds They recently had a remodel which means the inside is nice and they have the fancy double but unfortunately the remodel could not fix the main issue with this The The management is either not training employees properly or teaching them to bend the rules to keep a good because you will always have to pull up at this Even for perfectly reasonable orders at perfectly reasonable times burger fry at 3pm pull up next to the other cars already The one manager had the displeasure of dealing with was rude as I had to go back due to them forgetting several items on an order I had to pull up and wait for more than 5 minutes no and decided I just wanted it refunded to my The manager was rude about refusing to put it back on the card and insisting on giving me The best He made me pull up to get the So terrible a franchise for a this one just
31880,2,Cheap only reason to go lol
2171,2,Always seem to end up with missing items from my
8044,2,realy bad when the register personnel cant count change that is done by the computer infront of there

8049,2,Order was third McDonald without ice cream
2155,2,Possibly the worst Mcdonalds in The service is absolutely I saw a rat in between the two entrance The employees had done nothing about
27426,2,This people always try to rush you on the drive through and even if you go inside there are always problems with last time I went over there I had 2 cold cheese had to wait for my food and came the wrong If you want to eat tomato and onions good luck trying to find them in there are just 1 piece to none

1973,2,poor frequently gets orders We try and avoid this place even when we specifically have a hankering for We always have an issue at this no matter what time of whether we order from a food delivery service or in The orders always get screwed from missing items to getting a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle that just had If there was other fast food options besides pizza and halal nearby probably never go here But today I finally understood why a no It was a busy time since school had just let out and I stood for about 5 minutes waiting for a Pepper and watched the crew work in relative silence while pushing out food orders without tickets and without speaking to each Anyone who has worked in food service knows a quiet kitchen spells more trouble than a loud Eventually my sister flagged down the man doing drink orders and asked if the drink just placed in the row of 8 other drinks been setting down indiscriminately was our Pepper and he said was a Management here really needs to have a talk to the crew about working together as a team and especially when Yes just a and not expecting white glove service from a fast food but our community deserves better than what getting for
31984,2,Very slow service
1990,2,The best thing about this is the cleanliness compared to most McD restaurants in The worst thing about it is the They pay no mind to customers waiting in line to have their order taken even when it even busy in the Sometime they give me my Sometime my order will be ready in the but set it and realize it much as I watch them complete other orders wondering why mine is taking too and it turns out my order was read all they just never bother to call the I can go on and almost everyday something Two stars is the best I can

30301,2,Super slow to get It appears drive thru got all the 15 minutes to get food is too Also when I order a breakfast meal with a soda I want the choice to get a larger drink when they are all the same price
30296,2,Often very slow bc of the flood of Thirty minute wait for fast food is If you use the mobile stick to drive I waited 30 minutes for curbside pick up and 25 minutes in I recommend getting back in your car and going to be there and back with your food before anything hap

4578,2,Dirty old oil fries
29948,2,MacDonalds use to be a fast and friendly palace to order food what a disappointing restaurant with service and
4591,2,Staff is always rude
29931,2,We went in to order and sat down to eat because we had eaten in other restaurants on We were told that we could not eat but way we were told was very
29208,2,Slow and food was cold
29925,2,Could only order from Wanted some extras but serving staff struggled with English
29919,2,They took 17 minutes for my McChicken which feels like it take that and then they forgot my lettuce on it and the fries were wanting to bet that if I went again it would be but with most options out of stock I recommend going

29906,2,They messed my order up 2 They remade my sandwich and the chicken was still They have nasty You have to use the kiosk to place your There is no more service with a An update I now have food poisoning form the undercooked chicken I was served eat I will never come back here ever My reviews have been see by over
29962,2,This is easily the worst McDonalds experience Waiting an hour for fast food in what can only be described as a chaotic Staff are totally disorganised and management seems Only getting 2 stars because when we eventually forced them to cook our food as we waited blocking the it was piping hot and pretty
4635,2,
4547,2,Scariest ever been to
29180,2,Long line at drive thru
4466,2,A place where you can eat buy drugs at the same time Not even in
30014,2,Chicken nuggets were ice cold and disgusting the French fries it was like they poured bucket of salt on This is not the first time encountered cold overly salted food
4481,2,Staff are bot too seem annoyed
5425,2,Got two quarter Both So they do not make when
4489,2,Tbh every in the city feels like a portal to hell
4491,2,Food service needs cleaner bathrooms
30001,2,Every vehicle that ordered was told to move into a parking space to wait for their Why not just allow everyone to wait at the window if service is so The other thing that set me off is they had a lady in her late bring the food She did so with a loving warm smile but I only hope they take care of her when the younger fit employees clock No offense she was a sweet heart just
30000,2,This is my first time coming here and they made our order perfect then we ordered a waffle and we waited 1 hour for the waffle and the worker had the audacity to say do still want to wait for the waffle or a refund I said a refund and I was mad while walking out I

4541,2,Closed when is supposed to be 24 hours
28762,2,Unfortunately today while waiting in line to the side not in the drive through my frappe was given to the person behind She graciously take it and instead got off her car and walked back inside with I waited 10 mins and when nothing happened I went through the drivethrough line again and the girl at the window told me she was gonna give me that same drink I was very confused by especially in Covid I requested a different no offense to the nice lady that brought it back but just to be The worker said to me that the lady only touched the lid while carrying it so then I asked to change the lid to which they told me I had to pull forward and wait Needless to say it was not worth being late to work for this
5347,2,I love But always something wrong with my This I get a Only the bun with
5337,2,There was a roach on the counter by the The cashier and several other employees saw They looked at me waiting for my I will never eat there since the last review stated there was a roach They obviously done anything about it I will never eat there And reporting them to the health
4709,2,Come
4711,2,Typical
29834,2,2 adults ww children breakfast Had to go back to service counter 3 times no eggs in Then again hole in cup hot water Then tea bag had hole in so back to Food was cold by time we all sat down to No apologies were
5292,2,I had to go around the drive through 3 times to get everything that I Though people where usually very nice and
5291,2,Not very convenient if you just want to dine inside very little parking and difficult to get to other than that the food is the
5290,2,First of I understand why they had such a poor design with Parking is hard to get into and the shopping center has such a big parking such poor Then they take a while for faster if you order on the kiosk or app instead of waiting for them to take your
29829,2,didnt give it 1 star because the food was good but around 4 days i went at night through the drive thru and I gave my app code to get the i ordered something that was 15 dollars in total and they charged me 31 dollars and the reason for this was that the guy that was taking care of the drive thru applied my app code to another car my card is linked to the app and I ended up paying for their i know this because they guy asked my name and when I told him he said something to the manager and I yeah I think that car is using my code the guy just said is your lucky day go to the next window It was late at night so I give it much thought because I know just by giving your code you can get charged but next day I got surprised when my account got charged Tried calling but they solve my issue this is why I am leaving a review
5287,2,This might be one of my least enjoyable Food orders are bad slow entitled I would go out of my way to NOT go
5284,2,Everytime we go through the drive through here something gets The caramel flavoring is missing from my latte Fruit Fly is the No syrup in the Missing order There is always I realize a busy place but some attention to detail is
4725,2,I wanted to get a Unfortunately it was out of
5280,2,I ordered 2 They just left one of them at their prep area almost 10 After 15 minutes past I got one melted milkshake like creamy that my kid refused to take After left I drove back and asked them to make a new
4734,2,A very degraded and the staff is not friendly
4738,2,The order was simply We only received it after
29271,2,Cold fries
4742,2,especially in terms of but also the friendliness of the You know that from Germany much more cleaner and above all I like but we be going back What was there was enough space and on the upper floor you can also look
29262,2,Just okay
29893,2,Typical mcdonalds I The fries we tossed they were still frozen we watched them dump them in than scoop and fry them kinda Should of been tossed out entirely
5302,2,Very small There is like 3 tables inside and 2 It gets crazy busy during lunchtime so expect your order to take a while or be messed parking is
29838,2,It was a clean and convenient but we were quite disappointed with the service and food we We clearly specified using the McDonalds app that we wanted a quarter pounder no no no We received a fully loaded quarter AND when the lady delivered our app order to our she intentionally stopped far enough so we had to reach backwards to get her She made no effort to offer the She made us get it where she McDonalds needs to review procedures with the staff and seek to improve the customer experience
29875,2,Customer service needs some serious was the first words out the the drive thru not even a to And the Egg McMuffin bread was Not a good
5333,2,Will probably update with a coveted three star review after I go eat some after work dinner SpaghettiOs and am not Apparently my kid and the employees both counted two less McDoubles than I paid for guess four french fries instead of They stole my fries just like the last time I ordered fries for So dad get his burgers or Or maybe I can drive a couple miles through rush hour traffic and complain about a location always had problems at to a person who Think pizza night needs to be more No wonder all these big fast food places are going out of business in
29874,2,Dine In is NOT I went with family but we had to sit This is the case observed in the evening in majority of Placed pickup order and manager stepped out and addressed orders one by Burgers are served with ONLY bread and patty and NO
29868,2,I ordered my food for pick and when I walked into the it was cluttered with guests meandering which I understood the behavior after MY 45 minute that was AFTER I waited 8 minutes to even be acknowledged by an So staffing seemed just a lack of experience in prioritizing from the young
5332,2,the food here is First and last time The nuggets were golden The parfaits looked really thinking they were frozen and then sat in the sun and baked and then were put back in the They had me park to wait for my I stepped outside of my car to make a bottle for my The drive thru worker stuck her head out the window and parfaits are Do you have You want me to walk
4675,2,Slow service
29856,2,never reviewed a fast food restaurant before because my expectations are never too high drive thru at noon we were seriously in line for 25 This one has two separate planes to The order taker was very slow coming to the speaker for all the when paying we were barely but the worse was to When at the next window to get our the person did not even look at literally just handed a bag out the then handed the drink out the same angled down towards Better check out the new crispy chicken
29854,2,This morning went through the drive thru for my Two things medium Hot mocha plain and sausage Paid and advanced to the next Here is where things went The blue shirt manager last name begin with an on duty Had a serious She did not acknowledge my order so she gave me the wrong She gave me a bag with a sandwich and hash brown and walk away as if that was my I sat there until she saw me and I told her I am waiting for my coffee She said the there is no coffee on the I showed her the receipt and she walk on to the coffee and gave to Now I was going to let everything go until I heard her say these words after asking for napkin to wipe the chocolate OFF THE Which is her job Her Words loud and clear GOD I know I only spent a few dollars but IT justify getting attitude because this is your I ask for a
29852,2,Really nice McDonalds but the waiting is no one is taken the in house only drive thru is being taken care been standing here for 27 minutes until I got to put in my not a word said to me about the only 3 of the 8 desserts have Right next to me a customer brought up a buttermilk crispy chicken that got everything on it except for the After receiving my order employee I was telling waiting customers to use the touch One customer said she know how to use it so she was told by the employee to continue to I finally got my order after 39 minutes after coming in through the
29851,2,The kids wanted it kids loved it they had nuggets and service at drive through is borderline passive aggressive but you complain well like say your order and your but
5323,2,The only good thing has is the Shamrock If they ever stop making these I will never go I do wish they would put them back in the large drink It seems the prices keep getting and the cups are getting smaller and Very
4693,2,nothing good
29842,2,Atmosphere is cool and Ordered pasta and The wait time was service was definitely But it was also Easter and spring break But what was odd was that we got our cheesesteaks and waited an extra 30 minutes for our fries and That was weird and
29840,2,They have new self serve order kiosks but they are very difficult to They are not very intuitive at My order took three times as long to be brought Good idea on the kiosks but very poor While I was waiting on my order they had to come and tell two different people that they were out of what they ordered sandwich and something Store was newly renovated inside and out and looked very nice but I will not be
4704,2,Poor
29837,2,Went through the and had a They rushed us they were then when we took a bite we found out that the Sandwiches were completely Not even worth going back happened multiple times at this
6708,2,slow and bad milk shake was like drinking poorly made
3841,2,Poor
28755,2,so I went and tried the new Spicy chicken I personally prefer the spicy nuggets they are much more tender and fresh The Spicy Nuggets were Spicy add on the Spicy sauce and they will make you But mine were extremely dry and one had a weird rubber chewy piece so that was I can say I tried them but I was not
30884,2,Dawg hurry tf up mannn
30877,2,Took about 10 mins in drive No sense of urgency at
3325,2,Too many drug addicts inside and in front
6434,2,There was like no The toilets were so The food was like normal but it lacked a good
6431,2,I had not been here in a long time but that night the rest room was the most disgusting thing I ever The food was descent even though I was working my
6428,2,This place was quite dirty and very We tried to order some food for dine in and it kept asking us table There is no number on any When I ask the they said they will ignore Very
6437,2,Gave me the wrong and seemed very I did come again though and the food was correct and tasted like normal
6421,2,No electrical outlets for customers in a fairly large They also got my order ordered an egg and cheese biscuit and got which at least is more expensive than what I ordered even if it what I Hash browns They make it look like you get two on the kiosk graphic to trick
28397,2,This is my third time visiting this store horrible place to eat all the 3 person at the service desk did not even eye contact with me and after food ready they just damp my order on the desk and I had to asked one gentleman if that was my order then he said yes horrible place will not recommend it
6413,2,Too much loitering from homeless
6409,2,I was just there this morning homeless people were in there sitting down the security guard on his radio and not paying attention to going
6405,2,Loads of bums begging for food and despite there being a security they allow But on the bright they got my order correct and
30858,2,2 stars for correct food but rude service smh
30857,2,The customer service is not really Need more
28393,2,The only thing worse than the service was the My Big Mac tasted like it had been dropped in an
6438,2,Very slow for late No communication with staff for At least one of the employees at register is willing to admit fault for delayed food
3312,2,Really long line for messed up
6444,2,Place is overrun with vagrance and Steph any better this slow angry and miserable
6482,2,Asked for sriracha was confirmed that they had Yet when we got to the there was none in the Quite
3254,2,By far one of the worst locations in On separate occasions gotten received cold and getting homeless people asking for
30933,2,lazy At 6am there is hardly any yet waited for a breakfast for 15min
30924,2,They are NOT open despite what it
30922,2,Orders senior coffee at the new kiosk and it charges you more for using Go directly to the
3277,2,Staff inattentive gave me wrong food 3
6463,2,The two times i went there for lunch my fries where stale and there is a bunch or ppl from some rehab near by that sits in there and trys to sell stuff or arguing with each other security is there but do a good enough job in my opinion
30908,2,One step slower in service they would go By the time you get your food already
3290,2,I go on my lunch break at 3 am and wait 15 minutes for them to get their stuff together
30905,2,Drive thru was so slow and no sauce given when asked and displayed on the screen
30899,2,Made a special request on my I had to repeat it three times because a staff member ignored
30897,2,No idea why they completely neglected the dining trash cans trays of trash everywhere and all the napkins etc
30890,2,Extremely Food Did not feel like going back in to fix
6446,2,Ordered something and got something I asked not to include the but they added the Canadian Bacon and served
30887,2,Seriously the slowest mcd ever been
6401,2,We had breakfast here a couple of Always tons of homeless people One guys was dancing like Pretty entertaining
6397,2,Dirty slow service
6394,2,missing part of kids plus less of following covid19 disorganized to that gives opportunity of 10 strangers to gather on order or pick up
30850,2,Fast food is called such because you should get it completely unacceptable to wait almost 30 minutes for BREAKFAST
3458,2,Worst MC
6329,2,There was a constant beeping sound that none of the employees seem to The tables were greasy with fries At least the food was made But I still recommend using another
28441,2,too long waiting too high work load with minimum of employees
6317,2,Sad to say the only thing good r the work hard I only come for coffe they serve u with a smile part that this Is filled with homeless people homeless then to I come bk yes cause I enjoy the coffee befir church
6316,2,I would have gave this a better review They have a person or the store manager on the floor telling people they have to sit and the back or these people are the homeless and IV drug THEY PAYED FOR THEIR
3471,2,overcrowded
3474,2,Dirty and bad food
3475,2,Dirty place
6302,2,This place is not very When I first walked I heard yelling from a waitress saying and there were many insects in this
6295,2,For every good and helpful a bad and rude one to accompany These employees seem to go out of their way to be as unhelpful and rude as And regularly give you sauce packets that are and half honestly worth it to either go to the one in Penn Station or at 42nd
30734,2,Computers were not cash only a complete Cashiers do not know how to operate without
3486,2,I plead the 5th

28319,2,They can not get any order My order took 3 remakes and finally I had to go in to the after placing my original order in the drive
31037,2,Poor
28324,2,I dont understand because mc Donald is a fast food place and I go thru the drive thru and the tell me that I have to wait in one of the parking spots in stead of grab and like any normal fast
28333,2,Slow service got orders wrong but still kept people waiting while rest of their food went cold worst mc donalds been to for service

28631,2,The service in every Mcdonalds is doing worst with the
30503,2,In almost all I have been going have self order The bad news is when the machine freezes up you have to go at front and ask for help No help you need to l look ace the order
30501,2,Took an hour and a half to get food but friendly
5965,2,This place is more of a homeless shelter than a fast food There is an upstairs seating which apparently only opens when the employees deem There is literally nowhere to sit out
30492,2,Got nuggets and Asked for barbeque and ketchup for the Got no barbeque or good thing we went to the big enjoying dry nuggets At least the food was
5959,2,worked in the neighborhood for decades and this was always a decent go to place for a late night A couple of years ago they modified the they removed a lot of seats on the main floor in order to install electronic order There are now only a handful of places to sit in a ridiculously cramped Late at night they close the leaving pretty much nowhere decent to sit and Tonight I saw two people eating over the garbage cans and one eating by the soda The kiosks are They ask if you want to take out or eat If you select before you can pay for your order asked to get a table marker and enter the marker Thing is there are absolutely no table you cannot complete your order without unless you start over and select During the day perhaps eating in makes but late at night really only for take
30508,2,Fries were very cold burgers were creased as if once wrapped they were smashed with something service terrible but food put out
3715,2,Lousy
6021,2,just convenient and cheap if you on the run
30523,2,They handle a lot of Waited 10 minutes for my order outside
6064,2,Obviously food is the same however this restaurant has a loitering problem from some of the local The toilets in this one was also quite
28584,2,Forgets food longer wait time than some coasters in Ran out of diet
28590,2,Food was the same but this was a half hour wait for Clearly this franchise was not up for a noon rush
6056,2,Needs more Fight almost broke out between a homeless man and a
30560,2,All self ordering food took forever to come drink machine work
30553,2,Was under long order was gotten wrong
30548,2,Service was very Managers did not work with urgency to get orders out on time while people waited 20 minutes for their orders
6044,2,Extremely slow due to the lack of expensive compare to those around the
30543,2,THE SLOWEST AND TERRIBLE CUSTOMER Definitely not coming
6040,2,Food order took over 20 Nuggets were dried out and To top it all no sauce or ketchup They did refill my drink because I waited so
3707,2,It does not have a drink

30526,2,they can ring you up at the counter but you have to order through those Place smells like disinfectant and charges tourist
5958,2,No tissues what so not of tourists from chinatown tour It is simply shame on McDonalds to do these 3rd class and disconnected Felt like there was only one person working who looked like a team employees making team leader on
3755,2,month
5954,2,The service is if the food taste And anything more then the dollar menu the taste aint worth the I think being extremely slow is a all requirement
5953,2,I am not that pleased The ice cream is What I like about a lot fast food is that the ongoing clean up process is sometimes flat out Who wants the crumbs from the table next to in your or getting dirty mop water inside your because they are mopping under the same table your trying to finish your
5869,2,I came in at on a Sunday and no dam The only thing I want at in the morning on a Sunday is an egg mc They had no I only drink coffee and have breakfast at and they have acceptable breakfast
5864,2,It was a little packed but cleared out quickly the upstairs was not crowded at all very My gripe is that my server preparing my coffee dropped my lid on the floor and lookroceeded to place it on the coffee and hand it to So I kindly but firmly you just dropped that on the She gave a look I walked over to the garbage dumped I should hve called the manager but she gave me no Just wondering if she has a habit with other items dropping giving it to

28730,2,Bad service that give me what you order
5828,2,Staff were extremely Yelling at us to order at the kiosk even though we told them we only had
3832,2,Poor
5813,2,Staff is extremely rude and Except for the young 19 year old woman at the register that got the toy I specifically asked She was very The other a young man and a lady that seemed like the manager had a nasty attitude and the manager spoke to the helpful cashier very rudely
5807,2,Poor
28753,2,Strangely I almost always get skipped in line at this I will pull up as the lone vehicle and another pulls up a minute later in the lane beside me and get immediate I am not sure if because my car is quiet or what but its mildly Never has my sauce order been Even when I pay for Even when I ask and confirm at the awkward confirming sauce and then having to ask for the exact sauce you were just promised was in the
5801,2,Poor
30421,2,Only two power outlets in the whole place and the best one is at the Noisy and confused Not for business Has a 60 minute time limit on

30563,2,No vegeterian options
5879,2,Lots of dirty bathroom with long
30458,2,Beautiful establishment both inside and out but the soda dispensers working and waiting in line to get drinks and ketchup sucks when other customers are placing orders and facing the same
3759,2,Poor
5947,2,The automated machine print us a receipt so I told one of the employees who was nice enough to look up the The problem was I had no reference to chek the I spent almost 50 dollars for 3 kids and 2 I walked 5 blocks to get that food bbn order and when I got back to our job I discovered we were missing chicken nuggets and all the dipping I ordered 6 sauces and we got It really pisses me off because they always leave stuff out when we order large like they can only handle it if u have a simple so frustrating and plus like throwing out the you really need to be better about training your
28664,2,When you are starving and nothing else in sight for the pocket change you well why i go to
5943,2,this location has 3 floors but usually only 2 are accessible to recommend eating here and strongly suggest taking your order to go as the crowds of tourists and locals make it hard to find a
5941,2,Stopped here to get a quick the place looks very Homeless people in the entrance and The 2nd floor smelled like Just go here if you want to go to the bathroom or are really really
3767,2,Rubbish
5929,2,so frustrating to eat There is a virtual army of panhandlers from the nice guy who opens the door for you to the more aggressive ones that approach you as you or eat your In the place is still disorganized and in New Management at this location is pretty
28676,2,Had a unusual experience about Only 2 cars in front of Ordered using my mobile app I love Ordered a mc and guess It came with NO And enough mayo to make two Enjoy the
3768,2,soft drink without gas
5919,2,The food service is excellent if you are taking the food out However if you plan to stay eat there are many homeless people inside the odors from the bathrooms dies not make it Must clean up the odors inside if they want me back
28689,2,They need more happy people in there and people to actually Acknowledge there guest and horrible to feel like your a bother as a customer when your spending your hard earned working money at your NOT GOOD for the business at especially when your a This needs attention Immediately to earn the
5905,2,The food was fresh and The service was quick and the restaurant was Maybe but why do you have to ask for salt and And then none of that in the seating area I go find a take my food out of the and no To get have to pack my food up and go back downstairs for some frickin No other fast food place is like
30464,2,Sloooooow PM and just got a cheeseburger small fries from because I was late for a Took 15 minutes for this simple a burger
30461,2,The nuggets from this location were the WORST ever Unfortunately I taste them until gotten back to my otherwise definitely have asked for my money
5891,2,I honestly only went for a large French fry and to use the Very great Pay her
5888,2,Cold without the customize served 7 minutes got the melting Dirty mess
6067,2,Always super Not worth the wait if you do come They also had my breakfast mc muffin I know what else I can
6071,2,crowded and slow The worst combo for a FAST food place
28575,2,I tried to buy a burger for a homeless lady and the manager told me She then approached the homeless lady and told her to
28484,2,Waited 30 minutes in drive thru line be told they are out of fish and chicken
3569,2,Long lines
6239,2,It was homeless people hanging out inside asking for offered a person to buy a meal and was guess money was for Drugs or beer
28485,2,I was there to separate times one time I paid over more than the second time and got the exact same thing
6231,2,There is a hired male guard for the bathrooms to ensure only paying customers use which seems overkill and made me as a customer The technology of coded locks satisfy this need for other businesses in the Bigger concern is that a guarded bathroom was still incredibly If paying someone to hang around the bathroom all maybe also pay someone to hang around the bathroom and clean There was a copious amount of a vomit like substance trailing out of one of the stalls that had been there for some time and one of the two stalls Not
6227,2,a If you want eaten at eaten at them this review is based solely on the 8th Avenue has a SERIOUS homeless and the restaurant is always swarmed with If it were just that they were begging for I could forgive Unfortunately most of the people seen are out of their minds on whatever drugs and usually screaming and carrying They make me incredibly to the point where not comfortable eating here More than seen fights break Best to find another
6225,2,sticky tables and Expect to wait a while for food ordered at kiosk and at the No table service Dark Lots of though the guards do a good job of making sure people buy
6220,2,Security was Has an emergency to use He said No unless u purchase I explained I would get a coffee but I an Urgent need to He state not my I purchased a Will Never patronize this
6213,2,is fast food not because good but a quick cup of coffee expect much as far as The worst thing really is the ordering and waiting to get what you Worse is 8th Ave Very bad I asked for a straw I had dropped mine no no no I said pay for it never got the straw You will live eating the food get ready for cold And nevermind an extra Shame it was not bad but
3577,2,Very expensive and super bad The place was
3581,2,The food was the speed of the order to withdraw online was but it was a worker came in and told us in a very bad way that we had 5 minutes to finish eating and we had just started
6208,2,This review is in 2 1st the dining area and bathroom and 2nd the behind the counter crew and Mc seemed to have their own guidlines for And the guidlines they followed were NONE or The place was VERY social NO one to monitor or count how many people were allowed it did not feel or look clean or a safe environment to spread germs and alot of people from the street who were not customers just hanging around using many tables and shoulder to shoulder in the people passed out in the chairs with masks pulled They had ONE dining room person who just could not keep up with the mess that they were The bathroom was a horror obviously people were washing and cleaning more than just their hands was saving grace of the restaurant was the the food expediter and the employees making the they were all very thanked and the food was fresh and very Dining area and 0 stars Behind the counter employees and 4 stars Combined and 2 stars
6202,2,They need to keep the restaurant are equally homeless people walk in there bugging us
6194,2,The staff who work there have no manners I go there everyday on my break and when time to pickup my order just a you always polite and always say thank you even though no one ever says anything At this point rather talk to a robot than anyone who works probably get better
6190,2,Chances of being stuck by a hypodermic needle are pretty high at this Restaurant is full with people you really feel comfortable eating next
28482,2,Weird credit card tea was of a cup filled and would skip this
6188,2,To crowded and not safe with homeless and drug addicts hanging out The good was not the same as other Very disappointing with good and Last time going
6244,2,Ok for quick pick Not the best place to go for a semi decent The place was the crowd a bit rough around the and the staff appeared Have head better service same different later in the
28479,2,Food was Service could of been better
28459,2,Stay away from this Worst service
6265,2,This McDonalds restaurant was Neither more or less compared to my I find it on a negative side note the constant stream of homeless people entering the causing somewhat of a The service and the employees of the restaurant was helpful and
30688,2,The manager is not If you want to eat in the restaurant you must do it outside in the you cannot eat inside the restaurant
6263,2,Very dirty
3524,2,Mc
6260,2,Extremely busy when we visited at with queues at most of the automated order and hardly anywhere to sit once we had received our food which was good from the rather harassed looking Despite there being a clearly signposted No Loitering policy with a maximum 30 minutes to eat your this did not seem to apply to the rather insalubrious clientele who were occupying most of the seats in the back part of the I hesitate to use the word to describe this As it is almost opposite the Tick Tock which was really busy at breakfast we had planned to try this for but after give it a
30687,2,Food is typical for I decided to eat in but alarms were loud and constant the entire time I was Several people working and ignoring the various buzzers and This will keep me from
3526,2,Very expensive
6257,2,I had to give 2 star because been trying to call the phone number listed on the website multiple times and no one responded or go to voice mail with I had few missing items that I wanted to The food came fast but I have had better food from than from this
30683,2,Short of help and check your bag for
30674,2,Customer service was just poor and really eat since just getting a drink but for a place next to hospitality centric I was
30653,2,Trash cans outside were over filled and garbage was all over the At least the fries were
30652,2,No ice cream machines Always broken and right next to many hot theme parks where people want ice cream with
28476,2,The people working here are not Went through the drive through and the only only thing said to me was my
28478,2,Somehow they forgot to give us our big deal I needed the exercise and they did apologize
30651,2,My Nuggets Came Back Covered In Mustard When I Said I wanted mayonais the manaigs they tried giving me was disguting when i ate it and trhen the mustard got on my arm
28756,2,food is typically put together however curbside is a minimum of 20 minutes once you pull Then hopefully you can get a curbside spot because the spots are usually full of customers theyve had pull forward and park to wait for their might as well go through the drive thru
28510,2,Drive thru takes forever and orders are never the inside with the new send order plus counter orders mobbed and confusing
6172,2,To many homelessness are in this franchise it is quite disgusting
28545,2,The food was hot just not a fan of but two children enjoyed it
6115,2,This place is right next to New York penn station so expect a crowd and a long use the kios must The customers there tend to be loud and
28547,2,Closed early and drive thru takes forever
28548,2,Need to update breakfast app menu and add back the souther style chicken biscuit
28556,2,It smell and it was The worker were very pleasant
30580,2,biscuits were old and not going back
28560,2,They forgot the top bun on one Everything else much Thrown together and
3664,2,One of the worst been pretty dirty
30573,2,Came for dine in service apparently last one of the night since I got locked food was you know the terrible management is quite apparent at this if there is another option do not come here
6094,2,Fast and friendly service but absolutely No clean tables or chairs in the open food and everything else under the sun on the Floors Food in bathroom Only here because
6084,2,One of the ladies was very rude to three other I get worked those types of jobs and I understand not easy to be in a good mood dealing with so many customers all often the same problem many and I get people have mood but this was more than just it was Not gonna give one star because she was
28569,2,Took too long to complete dirty overall impression of a badly run McDonalds a
3671,2,I eat here I like the food
6081,2,Two stars are given to the star who made our visit experience acceptable due to her helpful behaviour and lovely Food was good but the place is not recommended for anybody especially tourists because it is alway
28574,2,Service food cold and Had to queue back up to get a
6121,2,Its a place to run in grab something quick to eat As far as sitting in there its not ok the ppl they allow in there are mostly homeless
6180,2,A lot was out of stock and staff attitude is horrendously bad
6124,2,I took my children and their friends here for a treat after We used ordering was promptly given to When we found seating was right next to the Security cursed up a storm around my children with great
6127,2,Dont think i would go here on my a lot of vagrants Not very food was
30623,2,The food was correct and but 30 minutes in the drive through was not

341,3,They forgot the side in the kids and noone will answer the
33240,3,It is said that it is 24 hours a day but in truth it is between 8 AM and around 10 I imagine it is for reasons of not having enough staff to
336,3,Clean restaurant and fast Ok
30182,3,Wait was not too long at Line moved Although order was incorrect and It took a long time to get 1 drink
4124,3,a hit or miss with At times you can recieved a good customer service and wait a long while to get your When you finally get your food from waiting so long is when not the food is not assembled properly or over cooked almost border line If you wanted coffee from this major of the staff cant make good I often look for a particular employee that makes it the On the other this location is one of the most cleanest locations ever been Management does a good job making sure everything is clean and ready for Every time I come in their always cleaning the deep refilling the machines and despite all the college kids and tourists wreaking the They do pick up the place in high traffic and complete orders in a timely manner with sacrifice to customer I would love to see more pride in the making of the order look close to the photo and consistency with delivering good customer
19654,3,Food was cold
22734,3,Regular Used Heavy WiFi traffic
30177,3,We used the kiosks to order and pay for the You are supposed to take a number and sit down and they will bring you your We had to wait for She told me had those kiosks for at least 8 The staff was overwhelmed with the amount of We had to get the food ourselves from the My poor mom had to wait in the line because she make the kiosk She was so stressed out by the time she sat

22737,3,Mostly a tourist expensive compared to average cost of in mainland
22740,3,The frapacinos are cold and taste really
322,3,Clean place good music on sound system close to discount movies
320,3,Completely cool but occasionally absentminded
22752,3,Kiosks broken and surrounded by homeless
4214,3,The food is predictably as it is part of the NY Automated ordering and paying with a pick up counter puts this one But the clientele here may be a wilder than some other and at this the single bathroom was unsanitary and had no working
15649,3,The price is fine but no matter what I go I always hav
30122,3,When we went it was cash They were out of ice cream and Our food was They were extremely
4284,3,Not the best Out of stock on alot of items
15646,3,Little pieces of instead of Large drinks were not even close to being The fries and sandwiches were
4286,3,Service is okay not the fastest but not the Seating is They have a bizarre sign loitering 30min
15644,3,Never a delay when I use the drive Cant wait until they are done with the remodeling of the play area
4289,3,At this location you have to wait a long time for your food usually cold and sign the garbage cans are so full no one empties them out like that
4290,3,Traditional run of the mill The food and staff and everything was what I expected of a not personally a huge fan of McDonalds but if you are this place would be great I Also forget to use their app they have so many great coupons and offers on it so you can get free
15640,3,Took forever in drive thru
287,3,Usually they they have the best coffee but yesterday it was watery and not that good
286,3,Order was French fries were cold and too milk shake was melted
19643,3,ok
4306,3,Staff was very fast the French needed more salt
22761,3,Very clean and room to
22764,3,Busy and they missed up the order twice
30105,3,The team had no personality and had even had one employee on his cell phone while making The food I got had the fries lukewarm yet the burgers were They were more concerned with talking with themselves and not the Outside of that the place was clean and recieved my order in a quickly manner
285,3,One refill per no ice cream the crew employees are professional though
4278,3,a Nothing too clean but I gave it 3 stars cuz my vanilla shake was made quickly and tasted better than
33160,3,Good
15652,3,Food was typical Had to wait several minutes while one lady ran around taking cars of a busy drive thru while the other workers were nowhere to be
4267,3,This place was okay it crowded and the food was very fresh is nice quiet place to sit and eat
19352,3,I honestly believe they gave me a cinnamon bun this stale
15677,3,Inconsistent in ther preparation of food and Instead of charging for meat substitution I was charged like I was adding additional
4229,3,I had the fries and They were
15670,3,I
15668,3,I have a I work here of 20 years old
4235,3,I love the seat I just understand why the upstairs is always This is one of those places that usually has ice cream
30142,3,If I was rating this on speed of service it would be negative stars but the food was good once we got This location is extremely busy and feels under staffed for the amount of business they What is the point of all the kiosks and a double lane drive through if it overwhelms the staff and you wait for minutes for a 10pc mcnugget
19647,3,Food too cold
4250,3,My food was delicious but they did mess up my The bathroom was so nasty and there is nowhere to put your stuff while you hover over the piss covered
30136,3,Well just because that is on international drive which is in the tourist area give him the right to jack up their prices and I go up and down international drive quite a bit I drive charter buses and because their prices are jacked up so high I bring a busload of people there now the young lady that brought my lunch out you know she was very very friendly very nice young lady the restaurant is clean but your prices are way too high and until they come down I will not bring 50 60 people in my bus to that location just because on international drive mean you can rip people off and all doing when I can take them four miles down the road to a Burger King and their prices are a lot lot lower so if you want to start seeing more charter buses come in there with people lower your prices
4253,3,The usual steady consistency in their coffee and brew fresh when Its not the best but brew fresh and stronger than DD any day
30133,3,I was here a couple times during a I would say it has been pleasant as But Saturday was not Trash bins over tables self help machines missing table and drink dispenser area was From what I could the back looked cleaned but the front of the house was a Back to the self help it states that they will bring you the drink to your They brought me the food but told me to get the cup up I really care but someone should change what the machine this is a modern looking Most of the days I went here it has been But I guess their weekend was a different
294,3,Not as fast as like sometimes but And cheaper than some of the other
15657,3,Food is what you expect from Trashcan by playground door smells of dirty diapers or rotten milk the last few times I have been Android pay is hit or miss
4266,3,I think I will be going to the 1st Ave and 14th street location any time Too many people just sitting around occupying space without ordering and I saw individuals walk in and walk up to the sofa machine with their own cup and serve themselves soda and walk One guy came in with a bag from KFC containing 2 buckets and 4 boxes with a cup and take soda from the machine and walk Crazy
33261,3,Ice the air is so strong that it let you stay to eat Orders are made with a if one is a foreigner in my it is not fast enough and others I totally rescue the attention of a dispatcher attentive and speaks both Spanish and it was what best stayed in my
33263,3,Excellent But the bathrooms are very neglected and the waste containers were completely full and there was no space for That part looks bad
19365,3,Service is very decent not too fat but not too
22121,3,Located at the beginning of the McDonald type with attention It does not have the best attention but it is not bad its accesses are comfortable as well to leave the In the rear sector it has parking to park and eat your order or

1169,3,What can I really say about Mickey D
2013,3,They renovated this place for no The staff forgot things in my order and not to mention that I had to wait long for simple stuff while people who came after me got their food and They gave my daughters the wrong toy and forgot food
2014,3,The service was maybe a little to They
2015,3,I order from grubhub here regularly today Iam absolutely shocked that there was a Large Coca Cola drink missing from my Double QP Iam absolutely Shocked and surprised at how Dumb these employees can be if you Fail to Put a Drink In a Combo meal Order you should definitely not be working in Fast Food you need help and Iam absolutely stunned at this whoever prepared my meal today and Failed to put my Large Coke definitely has the mindset of a Medieval Wagon

2005,3,The food is okay when on the But I just walked into the room and had to run For an establishment that maintains a healthy they absolutely need to update their 19th Century restroom And come up with a maintenance
2004,3,This place is you could order anything EXCEPT Everytime i order milkshake for my friend at whatever it ALWAYS breaks down and they ask me if i wanted something my friend is looking forward to that But i had a feeling something like this is gonna I just wish if the manager can order a repair on their getting a bit ridiculous for something like this to happen everytime i So not

24151,3,On the way back from all day at Universal Island of so decided on a cheaper meal to end the Had dinner with family Busy but able to order our meals from the auto screens instead of and since in Georgia they caught on at many Ordered several meals and customized my Buttermilk Crispy Chicken sandwich meal to include and and a large Service was great for They managed to work around us and keep things clean in the eating areas and Enjoyed the Went back for but paid at the and let them know we appreciated the
13580,3,It is called the largest in the Exterior looks great and interior as Two storied building with play area for the Mainly because of the world famous universal studio and Disney park and the other tourist facilities this is always not among the best in terms of service Long waiting for the No matter you use the kiosk or go to the counter to order your get prepared to wait longer than usual

6588,3,Was unable to order deals on the
13576,3,The aesthetic of this location was really There is a huge arcade inside as well as play area for Two tons of an aquarium and a bunch of other cool I was expecting a little better service and food quality with it being the largest in the It was cool to be able to order pizza and pasta since that is not something typically available at but as it incredibly Prices were a bit higher than normal as well but with all the extras at the restaurant that makes
24156,3,Very busy drive Cars were lined up literally around the building from pick up windows all the way to the front on the restaurant facing International Informed at the window that they were out of food items we and asked if we can order something even though we had a big order everything was in the The food were also hot and
6593,3,Drug dealers and users right Although the was a security guard at the it was not
6580,3,Its just ok for my I stand the atmosphere with the homeless hanging out there
13569,3,Nice the food is terrible
24132,3,They would do a lot better if they park every car in the drive I know they do this just to make their drive thru time look better to the but it absolutely ridiculous Simply process your orders faster and give customers their Every time been ended up waiting When only ordering 1 or 2 it makes it a little
6551,3,Regular I like the kiosk option

24056,3,Slow service food is cold
6510,3,My son enjoyed the but the AC working Place was hot and
24065,3,Fast therw to
13643,3,I realize this is a REALLY BIG and REALLY POPULAR because it is My friend and I were only in town for a few and this is something we wanted to While there we figured that we would order so we both got a dessert my friend got a and I got a Hard Ice Cream in a Waffle We ordered from the self serve for some reason the one we were at was not accepting not sure if the others were broken So I went to the one counter that had an Employee and paid since it was Ice Cream I was told that it would be available at the Ice Cream which made since where the Hard Ice Cream My friend and I waited quite awhile for a Staff Member to notice us standing I say notice since some came but never looked over at When one finally did I flagged her she told us that she not be told to come then walked I went to the main as I approached my number was being called from the main so I guess the Ice Cream counter was not the pick up the McFlurry came from the main but the Hard Ice Cream was coming from the Ice Cream that makes sense I I head back over to the Ice Cream and guess who reluctantly The young Female Employee who was now told to come over to serve she DID NOT look impressed to be After fighting with the sliding glass doors that cover the Hard Ice Cream for several she finally got them I had to point out the Rocky Road Ice one small scoop was placed on the Waffle and I was sent on my not sure what it was supposed to look since on the it only shows an empty Waffle Cone with no option of its It was an interesting but based on this one I would likely not return unless it was much less
13638,3,I know what I was a
13635,3,Really cool lines are extremely long 11 at They have about kiosks to make your but only 1 was operational when I Prices were extremely high the price for all menu items from my home

24079,3,
24087,3,Typical fast food place
6532,3,Bathroom needed to be clean more Cashiers were nice

6544,3,Just like any other and thats a good You always know what you are going to get
6549,3,just great and food was ok
13605,3,This place can be such a Hotspot since so special with having pasta pizza waffles and is so but compared to other the taste of even a cheeseburger The only highlight was the service the place was clean and the staff very But good service alone is not enough of the burgers are

13075,3,This McDonald tourist city attraction restaurant is over rated by local During my visit to this none of its employees had people skills or customer dissatisfaction resolution Its employees escalated its customers verbal complaints to verbal challenging Without any complaint
13074,3,This is a very convenient Probably the most affordable food in this area near the usually very busy with foot traffic for the beach and the You will encounter all types from international tourist to local fairly clean considering the large amount of The orders are quick but be sure to check it before Not the most accurate employees

7317,3,
13067,3,Bathrooms are very dirty and lines are very poorly I was able to skip ahead of at least ten people that were ahead of me because they communicate the registers that are open to the The booths in the far side of the restaurant smell like Food was served quickly and with good quality
24485,3,We used the kiosks to order and pay for the You are supposed to take a number and sit down and they will bring you your We had to wait for She told me had those kiosks for at least 8 The staff was overwhelmed with the amount of We had to get the food ourselves from the My poor mom had to wait in the line because she make the kiosk She was so stressed out by the time she sat
13065,3,I usually give high reviews but not this The service is Fast and professional staff all the Truely representing Unfortunately there is an issue with homeless people that brings this location The restroom has a bad odor because of the homeless people washing up in The restroom door close as to see going on in there such as drug use I can only There are plenty of homeless people going in and out of the establishment to eat and use the So they carry a bad It ruins the I witnessed a homeless man get hauled out by Santa Monica Police for lounging not purchasing any and being loud and I applaud the quick response of the security officer on duty who immediately asked the man to leave several times always maintaining his even as the homeless man a tough but getting The priorities are kept Customer satisfaction and safety are key to the staff and it
24490,3,Wait was not too long at Line moved Although order was incorrect and It took a long time to get 1 drink

13054,3,The new renovation it went through makes it look more The ordering kiosks are perfect for the tourist that speak English or It is very Please not to their the Homeless population can be a turn off to go their do to the fact that a hang out spot for I have no problem with that as long as they mind their own business and I do the One thing that surprised No refills on my That was one of the main reasons I went there for Besides we are taking Quick and easy meal compare to other higher price options
7341,3,This is an expensive
7343,3,Typical Micky Inattentive Luke warm burger and cold french
7347,3,Delivery speed is not quick for drive
13047,3,Long lines rude staff you ask for sauce but never get They only have one register Homeless at front entrance smoking blunts and can smell it while you are

27913,3,This location Is usually but not much Front counter Longest wait was 3
27917,3,The park was LOVED but the bus exit for the parking lot was Needs to be designed choreographed and thought out better
13085,3,It is an OK place to go if you do not have a better The prices and the quality of the food are reasonable
13086,3,Great food and staff but the crowd is a bit sketchy
7228,3,Restaurant is clean and Staff is Food is Good fast
13128,3,Decently quick service but just Prepare for the transients standing outside The staff kinda look they wish they were there and it kinda reflects on the They have the kiosks to order from which makes service
13125,3,As always just ok
24458,3,This is across the street from the Orange County Convention The girl at the counter looked at us when we got and made no attempt to greet us or even approach the counter until we asked her if she was The food was but the service definitely needs
13121,3,First of you will have a Santa Monica price That means more expensive than other places for the same item in the the restaurant was full of homeless people which disturbed meal quite often with their shouting and the restroom is freaking
13116,3,The food was The person working the counter did not seem to understand anything I There are homeless people all go there
24462,3,Great Not speaking English at the window is a big downfall for Not sure why they would put somebody like that taking I repeated myself three different times and then they finally brought somebody else to the Very frustrating
27951,3,I felt so bad about how crazy busy they were that I wanted to jump behind the counter and help hand out They did the best they could considering how hectic it and it was It was pretty cool to see the kiosk that you can order Much rather order my food through that than a
24463,3,The management staff were bullying a new employee by telling her have needed to clean the dirty trays the manger did this while the girl was taking my very The rest of the staff in the drive through laughed at the the poor girl and I was embarrassed for I mean I know just a starting job for some but they still need to be
13042,3,Nothing Just McDuck like just
7255,3,Our order was but we had to pull forward and and there was a general feeling of

12985,3,What a unique love the the only reason that why a low rating for me is because they sometimes get people order the only reason I Also this place is sometimes very crowded and
15050,3,Love the frozen cold brew
7451,3,lol what am I supposed to
27800,3,No self service options you have to rely on the employees to you everything necessary if they even bring it in the first place
12977,3,Busy but not accurate
7459,3,
12972,3,Slow drive through everything else is fine
27790,3,Went there for Doordash pick Store was So I parkedy car and walked to the A staff told me I have to get in line with all the drive through Which took me almost half an hour just to get to the window in my The order has already been placed and all doing is just picking it You guys gotta find a better system or else close this place down if you get it
27788,3,Not sure I have ever been to one that deserves 5 This was run of the meal Average in
27787,3,This is way more efficient than the other down by Animal Kingdom with the drive thru they are also a lot more friendlier at least on the But they cook my quarter pounder to temp because it was still red on the inside of the meat which was I had to go to the door in order to get my burger fixed which then I ran into the situation of them starting to close their doors 5 minutes before they were supposed to close at 12 and the employee looked at me and said we are closed when I literally was holding the burger in my hand to show for I look at the employee and say I know I came up here because I had just ordered from the drive thru this burger and it cooked all the She takes the burger say anything and shuts the door with me standing I then wait thank gosh she came back with a new one I know if she was going I get an apology though for my burger not being cooked all the way through

13011,3,Staff is so Homeless people sometime come in this Then polis
27854,3,Soooo Waited on line so long to find out there were only 2 people sure they make more than enough money to hire more
27853,3,Average mickyD not Customer service was not stellar and left much to be Local clientele made it not optimal for kids unless you are
7404,3,okay could be
7384,3,what it Good staff
7218,3,The chicken patty taste old not But over all good place to
27972,3,is I just wish they pester people in leaving while the kids are playing in the play I mean I get the no but we bought and kids are just trying to play and they really finish their own They just wanted to enjoy the empty play area
7211,3,Three separate times been there they screwed up the Forgot something every
28057,3,Not enough staff to take While I had a very basic order it was make a big deal just Very clean restaurant Also needs to have more English speaking associates
7011,3,The food and service was good but kind of disappointed as this is the 1st been to in the south Bay that has completely closed off the bathrooms and customer sure due to pandemic but strange other at least have restrooms open for guests
7012,3,They just be throwing my daughter Happy meal meal in the box not sure if me or if the people working at but yeah my daughter is tired of her Happy meal just been thrown in a box not a Happy meal a throne in a box meal kind of sort of and if you want fresh fries and fresh nuggets you have to ask and been several times where ordered something and missing so I have to make sure you looking your things before you drive completely off from this
7013,3,This McD has the best prices along Lawrence can take up to 20 minutes during peak I get a breakfast deal in the app to complete in time due to the long The app allow curbside or pickup 10 minutes before breakfast
7014,3,The food came quickly and it was hot my sausage bisquick was really but the big breakfast came without asked for they said it was in the bag but the only thing in the bag was syrup and we order
7015,3,I am a little apprehensive in saying but lately I have eaten at this and one other place near my home and meal I order has been tasting noticeably I never say to my you have taste here taste take 1 bite and tell me this is With that I would like to get some confirmations from others if food has improves in taste or just I see myself with a big belly if food taste quality is on the up
7020,3,When I walked in some dude was walking out with a mean know what happened The wait was kind of long but the food was
13258,3,the only thing that is unique is the close proximity to the Santa Monica Beware of the homeless who pester you as you walk into the Some will even come inside to bother
7023,3,Slow moving and long I wish they had more
24364,3,It was I ordered and
28054,3,The Asian looking manager killed my I was asking questions about their cafe drinks in a bubbly tone and he just replied in a really monotone I was trying to make conversation and he just ignored now I feel awkward as
7038,3,This McDonalds is hit or miss depending on the Its quick most of the time due to the dual drive through order but that can also work against them and can slow down you getting your food at times to if you get out of They seem to have great breakfast but the dinner team is hit or One day its great and the next time your order is all jacked They are normally pretty good with the normal menu its the specialty stuff they jack like a Big Mac is Good here but a Grand Mac be because they leave off half the sauce or something 5 lbs of you get what I Inside tends to be better then if you have the
7039,3,Food tastes like any other Mc There was a short They were out of Diet Coke in both soda They were also low on ice for the The dining area needed to be cleaned of all the trash by the soda and They were also out of ketchup in the ketchup area by the soda
24378,3,Took forever to get our food every day we were there this week when they got very One night we were there for almost an hour waiting in a I feel like they might have been understaffed because they working Everything was good and correct but they ran out of one items I ordered so they replaced it with a different
13246,3,place was kind of crowded and the waitress who took the order at the cash register was more concerned about her phone then just getting me two chicken sandwiches not one to nitpick but I had a job in 4 years and people like that actually get hired I just know where has my country gone LOL
13245,3,Just a another They have 4 do it yourself ordering kiosks where you can order and They are usually I waited 4 mins for my
7044,3,This gets a 3 rating due to their lack of attention to drive thru Numerous times we get home after a visit to and notice the forgot to include apple or apple I agree these are smaller items and do not effect the price when you have kids waiting for their orders get very upset and get angry n hurt that these things are It is very we tend to order a lot of unsweetened ice 8 out of 10 times the tea tastes It is old tea or the bag get changed when the make I get so mad that no one seems to care enough to be sure every shift cares to do their job correctly to ensure a high quality in ALL their I have brought these concerns to numerous managers and employees but never get satisfaction that they care and fix the It may be ok for a week but happens again or on a different All emplyees should care enough about their jobs and themselves to do the best they can in all areas of a job Please do your best to inform this of these issues and have them retrain and fix these My sanity and their job performances depend on Thank
7050,3,a hit or miss sometimes they have the best customer service and the fries are Sometimes the guy
7053,3,service was okay during drive GET OFF THE PHONE AND PAY ATTENTION WHEN YOUR IN DRIVE DONT GOT FOR YOU TO REALIZE THE CAR INFORNT OF YOU IS I Do not like their drive thru parking They moved it somewhere I went during lunch and they parked every single car and then had only one employee walking out the Hmm bad
24385,3,I came here on my way to a meeting in the convention I had 20 minutes to be where I needed to be so I figured I would swing by this and grab some Boy was that a I arrived at this at I did not order my food at the window until 10 minutes after By the time I actually got my food it was closer to This has to be the absolute slowest in the history of any restaurant in the It has double drive throughs and they seem to prefer the inside Lane to the outside They were taking the orders of customers on the inside line too if not three to Not exactly sure what was going on inside the But they were slower than I understand that there is issues right now with finding employees for a little bit of prep work would have sped up the process a little why I gave them three stars instead of
7026,3,Actually the great suck we have milkshakes and we got shorted a burrito and their night shift is quite rude will not eat there again
7059,3,Place is usually not busy but service can be they seem to be Staff The place has really odd seating layout inside but they have seating outside in the Drive through is usually empty They have assigned mobile order
7006,3,This is a typical I ordered a frape and had to wait 10 minutes for it to be Not
7001,3,Friendly but sometimes they have young people taking orders that have no quick and fast for lunch
6948,3,Mickey Ds is always mickey Lol
13307,3,Service is great but the restaurant has a smell of homeless all
13300,3,Very nice very quiet very efficient not chaotic the way it used to be a very big Improvement go visit
24347,3,This mc is self order And the self order board working So it made for a lengthy They have any cash sale It seems they only want drive through As far as the you know what your gonna get
13297,3,Like the new look and their own parking like the automated machines taking over the the actual
13292,3,Duh duh duh duh duhhhhh lovin
24349,3,The food was but the arcade area was a total letdown for my 5 and 6 year We only spent but essentially none of the games worked and they get any tickets when they should To small children this is a big The young man at that counter was kind and apologized I get
6973,3,This is open has two lines to order food through drive the speaker on the one I went to is a little and they got my order Luckily the staff member read back my order before I paid and I was able to correct it before I Food was barely warm but well
6978,3,Late night service is they reset their registers at arbitrary times and they either are cash only or close the drive thru completely during this There seems to be no just depends on when they think be slow it Those inconsistencies the food and service is typical
7005,3,Even after confirming my order when I received the wrong I went through the so I realize there wit until I got I had received a chicken deluxe sandwich instead of a quarter pounder it was and well but still
6984,3,Items were frequently missed but I get these people are slammed with so you expect the orders to be accurate But my little one got so mad when she found out her drink and apple slices from her HappyMeal were I mean come you order a Happy meal and only get a burger with nothing to at least you managed to put a toy in so thank you for Not AND we were the only ones in line at that so they were not that busy I
24352,3,fast food so its hit or Often the fry grease tastes The Tea fluctuations in sweetness can throw you for a loop going anywhere from bitter to Half the time late shifts miss part of your order and if they are busy sometimes the food especially fish and chicken wraps do not appear to be fully Other times its
24353,3,As so often is the my big Mac hot fresh coffee was cold but they did replace no friendliness of staff just
6990,3,Food but the ordering app makes these necessary visits less You still have to deal with those in front of yo
6991,3,The food was great with the exception of the They were stale and I would have gone back around and had them but the guy at the window was annoyingly slow and the rest of the food would have been The hamburger made up for it did you see the greasy heart attack waiting to Just an mobile ordering saved absolutely zero time at this We still had to go to the and wait and they have anything ready so unless you just like ordering from an I would still recommend eating YMMV on the staff at any fast food Sure this guy was somewhat annoying by being slow but he intentionally being a jerk or
24354,3,they rarely get my order I know my order is taken correctly because the woman who does drive she has a long braid and she is
13279,3,ok for a beach side A bit of a homeless presence but not as bad as you would see in downtown
13278,3,Friendly staff but the place gets shady after 11 Though open till i would not recommend going for late night
6997,3,No hot mocha in the Why is coffee with chocolate milk so fast food Mickey
13272,3,The coffee is It is clean and warm and I always regret eating
28062,3,Tepid food after waiting 15 min is not Florida needs to step up its focus on food When their fries are hot and fresh you get But cold enough said
6942,3,Took a long time to get food
13233,3,Pretty sketchy the only ever been to that had 2 armed guards at the food was as expected tho the new menu was hard to figure out too high
28047,3,Totally hit or Old town is near by So Friday nights and are busy at decent staff and consistent with the chains food
13178,3,Very good service they try to keep it only alot of homeless We get something quick to go always full of ppl
7156,3,Night staff is usually the making fresher food Even if waits exceed afternoon staff needs help
13174,3,Before heading to Santa Monica pier we made a lunch break here so we can grab a quick bite to eat before heading to the Location was great and the service was fast and
13173,3,Just another McDonalds restaurant for a quick The quality is the same than in any other McDonalds So nothing better than in From my point of view the services were not as clean as I have That is the only bad
24427,3,When we went it was cash They were out of ice cream and Our food was They were extremely
28002,3,Food often
7176,3,Staff we not communicating with I think their register was down and they missed a couple of our items and they both seemed really stressed and
7180,3,Food comes out quick and the food came out too much traffic in the drive thru however
24438,3,I was here a couple times during a I would say it has been pleasant as But Saturday was not Trash bins over tables self help machines missing table and drink dispenser area was From what I could the back looked cleaned but the front of the house was a Back to the self help it states that they will bring you the drink to your They brought me the food but told me to get the cup up I really care but someone should change what the machine this is a modern looking Most of the days I went here it has been But I guess their weekend was a different
13179,3,Usually soda fountain is not very fizzy and employees are quite Other than that a good place to get a quick bite on your way the beach
13156,3,Bit sketch here late night
24441,3,Well just because that is on international drive which is in the tourist area give him the right to jack up their prices and I go up and down international drive quite a bit I drive charter buses and because their prices are jacked up so high I bring a busload of people there now the young lady that brought my lunch out you know she was very very friendly very nice young lady the restaurant is clean but your prices are way too high and until they come down I will not bring 50 60 people in my bus to that location just because on international drive mean you can rip people off and all doing when I can take them four miles down the road to a Burger King and their prices are a lot lot lower so if you want to start seeing more charter buses come in there with people lower your prices
27985,3,This location is frequently busy and if the general manager on the dining room and play area become dirty Service is notoriously and since they cater to primarily a transient there really a need to
7188,3,Unfortunately there are not many salad selections if trying to eat
7197,3,Take too long to wait for curb side
27980,3,It was ok lil wait because busy but not too bad and food was
24447,3,If I was rating this on speed of service it would be negative stars but the food was good once we got This location is extremely busy and feels under staffed for the amount of business they What is the point of all the kiosks and a double lane drive through if it overwhelms the staff and you wait for minutes for a 10pc mcnugget
7200,3,Have a drive through though typically faster to just go Car lines can be a bit
7202,3,Had to wait 10 minutes on the side waiting for a Quarter Pounder all the while the other bag was getting
13136,3,Every time I go to this everyone is so friendly and make me feel welcome EXCEPT the cashier named She gave me the WORST COSTUMER SERVICE She was disrespectful and How does let her work
13155,3,My order was not completed because I asked for grape jelly and 2 employees gave me strawberry and said grape exist at that When I told the head manager I was allergic to strawberries she apologized to me and said they have plenty of grape jelly and gave me I also had no napkins in the bag so I had to come
7063,3,Not the best quality fast but
28006,3,Good for a quick bite on the go with a busy day right across the street from Old Town this place is got an indoor playground which is The kids enjoyed it the one time we came in and stopped and let them Unfortunately the last time we came through the and there was a vagrant near the one entrance so that was a little unsettling other than that has go it was okay
28023,3,Absolutely the worst service I have ever had at a The place was busy and lacked the to handle Customers angry having to wait so long for food while others had to return theirs because of inaccurate It took me 20 minutes to get a simple order one chicken wrap with sweet
7077,3,Versus others in the area this place always has trash bins full and rarely tiloilet No changing tables in mens Dirty Food consistant with Very busy but still could be
28042,3,Have to place your own They forgot some of our Bathrooms Play area still
28040,3,They did not get my order right at the so I had to go back and was late for work
7085,3,I am not sure if anyone in the USA would read reviews about but here it is They are mediocre even by fast food Unless you are really hungry or thirsty always try to avoid
13218,3,It was crowded and it was a little confusing to find the line but the food came fast and was consistent with other We ate in a covered outside location that was really
7087,3,Typical but did look a bit more The lady taking orders was Plenty of parking and drive thru line was Good amt of mobile order parking as
28039,3,Very close to Clean and quick
13214,3,They really try hard to keep it clean and friendly but due to so many homeless people inside and out of the store impossible to enjoy coming to this location without be harassed by free parking on
13213,3,It was interesting never had to pay for parking in my life or for the bathroom but it was nice to eat some at the high price that it was
13188,3,Always have the homeless there taking the Santa blame them for hanging out but all the good tables are taken by Otherwise just your everyday McDonald
7099,3,They say they are open but they are closed everyday between
13207,3,The was busy but very say I was impressed with the 2 napkins provides for 3 food and how they add the ketchup
28035,3,3 stars for being a clean and friendly but never be a 5 star stop because they NEVER have ice matter where you go a chance they are out or the machine is On completely down all I know that ice cream machines being down is a running joke but this location is the king of
13200,3,Out of the places I have visited here sadly this one offered at least the most friendly of the people I However it is more expensive then the basic McDonalds use It is one of the cheapest around considering your other
7116,3,app glitches out and they made pay extra for what I order through the app because the deal apply anymore
7117,3,Not the best Service was fairly slow for not being too and my order was given to go e
13197,3,Very slow
24412,3,The team had no personality and had even had one employee on his cell phone while making The food I got had the fries lukewarm yet the burgers were They were more concerned with talking with themselves and not the Outside of that the place was clean and recieved my order in a quickly manner
13194,3,Long lines and short staffed it They can be good other then Tried the bacon cheese fries and I instantly wished they was not only for a limited time
7121,3,Like always very pleasing but the area outdoor can use some Staff great
7101,3,Standard But what was going on with the Only two available and one is permanently The other one is a favorite place for the homeless people in ten area as it Two of them spend there No chance to get
24053,3,Clean and cashier was
12218,3,Poor service and constantly messing orders
24966,3,At least they finally so it feel like the 60s
26261,3,Usually really good but this time I was missing the deluxe on my chicken deluxe burger I

26923,3,how good can it Tastes the same as it did 50 years ago when I was a kid
12197,3,Fast good great workers
24985,3,fast food place to grab a quick lunch with a friend between seminars
12195,3,They need more people on the Very short staffed
12194,3,Ok for fast play area is extremely nothing
12193,3,so liked found it more expensive than Canadian ones
8657,3,is a really popular place but i think there also very complacent why do they always put there fish fillet half way off the bun i like the taste of the fish but it would be nice if you added lettuce and tomato to the sandwich all
12191,3,Quick clean friendly and remade my fries
8660,3,Great customer Food was old tasting and hard for some
8651,3,been a few times and of the time been great with prompt service and order right but the other half of the time it was long wait and order Like I asked for hot n spicy with cheese and double cheeseburger and my burger had one patty and 2 pieces of cheese and the hot n spicy have cheese and the chicken was really dried out and So a toss of the dice on how it But they are 24 hour so I still go lol
9105,3,Lobby was closed but the drive thru was I tried to order on foot but they take my
8734,3,The reason why keeping this three stars is because the customer service was the food that great had better McChicken was felt like it was just warmed up in the microwave the bread was stale and the fries were great because I like to order my fries with no salt and if looking for some fresh fries remember to order fries with no The was The inside of the cooking area looked really clean and spic and span the only reason why giving it three stars is because the food quality was not great at all so if you can improve that then you can either get another star or two more stars it depends on what you guys want for you to
25017,3,Like most all other McDonalds nothing
25053,3,It was ok
12096,3,same anywhere you go pretty

12092,3,Food is good but getting what you order the first time is a whole new challenge
8832,3,This is a good location with easy access off 5th I like the new renovation which add 2 drive through lanes for faster Overall a typical
25061,3,Slow service
25066,3,yummy
12085,3,Greasy food but ok
12100,3,There is nothing special or exceptional about it is just like any other and I only went out of convenience and lack of options
12084,3,Every time I go to I either get cold food or something is wrong like hey I want a Mcchicken add tomato and when I open it has bun mayo lettuce tomato but no chicken like where did it go
8838,3,a what do you really The location is pretty sketchy as downtown SLC is full of homeless many of whom use illegal But it looks clean the fries are and the employees at the drive thu seem to completely despise their Cheers
8840,3,really like the area a lot of people starring at you while trying to get food because there waiting for work because they work legally in this state so they chill out at this McDonalds and home depot department store to try and find work every single day and it makes it a little Cause they just stare at you anyone in the line at
12076,3,Clean but took very for fast food at to actually receive the order

12101,3,They did pretty good for late night and a bus full of Food was
25051,3,Its a Same as all the others
8739,3,has been around since the dark ages it seems and they have always been a pretty good place to enjoy fast But lately the food improved any but the prices have skyrocketed and I refuse to go there anymore for what you pay for their meals you could dine out someplace with a lot more ambiance and social
12143,3,Constantly messing up your Makes you want to go somewhere else and
8741,3,If you want to meet angry homeless people who leave a giant mess at the seating area and then practically acost you for sitting at THEIR spot when they return from 20 minutes destroying the restroom to find that as a have cleaned the wrappers off of the wiped it and seated yourself for a you COULD think Fortunately for this particular the staff are all very nice and the food is as good as Homeless people need to forgive me for and not thinking anyone was It really was just a pile of I trying to ruin you win
25021,3,Hard to get a custom order correct
26890,3,Great Slow bad 2 lanes into 1
8744,3,Food was They messed up on my drink but this is something that commonly occurs at most The was very slow but that could be because they are short

8826,3,Slow service and challenging communication
8773,3,I am not going to hold it too much against that them this particular store is in a part of town where there are a lot of homeless Any other restaurant in the same area would have the same there are a lot of homeless people in the parking lot and in the but there is nothing about this that is threatening to personal say this having gone here easily 100 times doctor thanks There is also an employee always in the parking lot or the store wearing a black shirt that says in big white What this actual background is in security is less the entire training consists of putting on the The store is not as clean as one is used to with and the service tends to be I assume this is because they have a hard time keeping good at the end of the I am impressed that the workers are generally courteous and the food is generally the same consistency and even with the particular challenges of being in this part of the
25040,3,Asked for hot coffee and it was

25399,3,This is right by my house and really the only reason I continue to Service is excellent but missing something from my order every single time I Having to go thru the hassle of getting out and going inside really defeats the purpose of going through the drive thru

5303,3,Customer service needs more Girl said I meant looked frightened to be Good news I ordered 2 lg Frappes and they gave me a punch card to get a free one after buying so Only been to with So good And practice makes put yourself out

5874,3,Had a few McD sundeas and mcflurrys while in Long waits and always But if you need a WiFi or an ice Bigger portion sizes then Europe and lots more expensive Mango smoothie very good
6036,3,There is sufficient seating on three Restrooms could be so could the rest of the
14731,3,This place had the tenders and fish sandwich for a They say they ran out but been a while That or they forgot to remove paper from drive What I like eating here Has a fire place and over all Employees are your average 21st century customer service
14660,3,It was okay
23650,3,O came through the drive though and the guy there was so nice such a pleasure to be around you could tell he definitely cared about his job to the point where I actually gave him a tip at the window he ended up selling me to buying more than what I anticipated then I got home and of course behold my food was incorrect called back spoke to the manager the manager said absolutely come back in and we will correct it which I did and steaks happened came back through the a new manager was absolutely wonderful how you handle something that makes it worth going back or Mistakes
14104,3,Very friendly and try to show Frys are always hot and The one problem we face over and over is corrrct and extra sauces for When we ask for sweet we end up with If we ask for extra I can only think of one time it was All in all the crew members there try to do a good respectful
6033,3,Visit was The first time they have what I wanted which was a Crispy Chicken Snack Their Quarter Pounders as good and I ended up throwing away some of
5307,3,Went through McGriddles were hashbrowns were orange juice was room LEO GETZ WAS GO TO THE
5308,3,Mcdonalds new blueberry pie is not gonna
29261,3,Nothing different really
5304,3,Be careful parking on the south side of the building during busy hours because the cars in the drive thru will block you very
6039,3,I liked the service but upstairs was Staff should keep tables
28622,3,Not professional when speaking to but take what you
28625,3,Ok place to come by with family too eat clean bathroom
5966,3,The burger my husband had was fine my chicken sandwich was It tasted old and The fries and sweet tea were the same as any other obviously fresh because it sees extremely heavy The ordering kiosks are super convient but you customize as in you take onions or tomatoes off of your and of course no cash payments are accepted unless you go to the actual Seating is not well arranged but being 3 stories tall it can fit about 100 I go
28653,3,Would get more stars if they got my order right more than 3 out of five times
23629,3,The food was But there was almost no one in the To ask for I had to stand there for almost 10 Maybe they are very short Other then it seemed
5962,3,They renovated their store and very nice and They staff is pretty much like all the other fast food chain out there school kids working part so nothing out of the They have free so you can definitely take advantage of the service and surf the web while enjoying a sweet tea or They have the basic dollar menu sweet apple apple cone and some other but too bad they have the chicken sandwich or McDouble for a The seating area can get packed sometimes and they always open the third floor to the although it really fit that many but sometimes you would have to wait a while for someone to finish before you can get a table and
14705,3,Fast food movesca bit Which would be fine if my fries and sandwich were hot and got my order Disappointed I had no pickles on my chicken sandwich which was not even warm and fries cold and Very Busy can become
28654,3,Food slow service for fast
5957,3,The prices at this is crazy astronomical compared to The promotional Saweetie Meal is priced at Even in hotspots like
14704,3,Sometimes the service is good sometimes the service is Sometimes get your correct food sometimes you get the correct food you But one thing is for certain they get their money tired of the some timing so I will not come
5910,3,Decent but fountain soda broke
5353,3,The nuggets had a nasty after The Big Mac was good
28682,3,This McDonalds location never staffs an employee at the register to take This results in all customers having to wait until one of the kitchen staff happens to notice the customers standing at the wishing to place their The expressions on the faces of the kitchen staff makes it clear that they are irritated at having to interrupt their own work to go over and take customer This situation has not been corrected for over 6 resulting in annoying wait times at what is supposed to be a fast food Hire more
5334,3,The fries were soggy even after I had requested fresh They always forget so check your bag before u pull away
5924,3,If rushing to get an early cup of coffee I suggest you stop here a little while wait for just one coffee
5951,3,ok but so crowded by the cashier because
23621,3,It was I asked for my stuff to be hot and they I feel like regardless at lunch time 12pm stay But this location is so far the best to Everybody loves and I know how some people could do this everyday been so pricey crazy I can only maybe do it once or twice a month when I have to for
5338,3,Food ok Employees at the drive thru Should all be They no nothing about people Skills or customer I wont go back Keeps happening to
28663,3,The rains made a mess of the drive 20 minutes was ridiculous
14694,3,your standard Food is service
5926,3,Typical New York city Staff is very welcoming and everyone has a hairnet on today wow even the
5940,3,Surrounding is not tables have trash on them left by Needs someone on the upper level to clean up There were no napkins or ketchup upstairs for customers to Burgers being served without lettuce and tomato you now have to purchase this and when you do its very tiny The burger meals are over Service was on We have to be sitting in a untidy and unattractive Worst of all why is there a sign in the restaurant telling customers you only have 30mins to eat and like That sign needs to be Not returning to this Fix up and clean up the
5341,3,They messed up my order and I only ordered 3 small But I called and one of the managers said she will fix it for Food was good no line at the time I went
29238,3,Nice and
28669,3,Only one the place was super busy waited 28 Minutes for my food it was worst experience

6002,3,Typical not real clean but average limited seating at ground more seating
5909,3,Food was typical As far as the location goes very usually a fight to find a table especially since the 3rd floor always The restaurant was pretty clean considering how busy they were but the restroom was Felt like I needed a shower after using If you eat here hold your restroom break for
5360,3,Service has always been Traffic flow great during a a very small with homeless hanging out around it quite Needs a
29249,3,No good
14672,3,Crew was a little I had to ask for napkins and water to clean the and they messed up our orders
5890,3,What can I say about a that sits in New York City on the busiest day receive your with steam coming off the the security guard keep away the Hurray Mcdonald Yall fancy with your self serving machines
23274,3,slow as a Those that are are courteous and what I understand is considering the that this better
29193,3,
5377,3,workers speak Spanish only so you customize orders because they speak English
14192,3,Average Mcdonald Long drive thru line and they were not up to date with the Received food that tasted kind of old and no customer service
5994,3,Very crowded with a lot of tourist a lot of seating upstairs and amenities like wireless But a more expensive and way too
14712,3,Be ready to a so you know what to expect in regards to the The problem at this location is the speed of since about In April they changed to drive thru only and have since added carry for those willing to walk Both the drive thru and in person wait are constantly Most recently I went there for a Big Mac meal and it took 5 minutes before I could place my order with only 2 people ahead of me and then waited minutes for my order to be I did see 2 people that ordered after get their orders and neither was a smaller
29201,3,Typical fast food place
14137,3,Always some kind of liquid on the Always here employees yelling at each Place is dirty and they seem to clean
5968,3,Its hit or miss Sometimes its fast sometimes it takes forever to get your The one thing I must say is unlike other mcdonalds they always get your order right so that is definitely a It is a little more expensive too because in If you go to the bronx or brooklyn it cost you
5892,3,Visited a couple of times while in the area for civil court and the staff behind the counter are usually but the security guy in the lobby or the floor manager or whatever blocked me trying to leave with my telling me the sitting area was upstairs when i was literally just trying to When I sat down here this morning a manager started harassing a customer who was sitting with a cup of calling him telling him he had to leave in 10 minutes and causing an argument between the guy and another and just walked away while they yelled at each Not very cool
5986,3,Went here and got a coffee and used the Not really an ideal place to but in Chinatown not many Coffee was but restaurant the
5984,3,They give condiments with the meal and when they were very They were pretty fast with the meal
28639,3,atleast they are open Laure for driive through
28697,3,Some small tables are uncomfortable to sit Service was very slow in the they were unable to provide table Food was left at the counter while you were waiting at the table with your number asking yourself why was it taking so
5981,3,I asked for an egg white delight but they were so I got an egg McMuffin and a sweet The egg was underdone and still The tea was not sweet it just had sugar added to unsweetened
14681,3,Food is what is customer service could use more
28643,3,Ashes for a cheese burger with no pickle or onion and even had ths sticker on the Still had pickle and onion on it
5906,3,It was a fast we ordered using a touch which was very fast and you can pick from their full menu and change from selection real It was an order for two and we had no you can pay using your credit card without any human chicken nuggets with a couple sealed the deal for

14231,3,Menu did not have all the sandwiches it in addition the menu need to remain static so that people can clearly make a informed choice

26521,4,Not entirely sure what I expected when going to the worlds largest I mean just a fast food place The place is huge brick ovens for thin and crispy hand crafted pasta and speciality meal the everyday kitchen then followed by a staircase to an playhouse and more sit down The pizza was only after It was a small personal pie thin and crispy b
26520,4,The food was quality but service took a I liked the food a I had heard of the location having pizza and pasta so I got I also got a large fries a burger and Me and my party enjoyed the food and honestly the pizza was in some ways better than other pizza Only recommend going through the drive through and not getting the special items only because the wait when you order pizza or pasta is increasing Not sure if this is a regular issue but seems like when I have gone like
26518,4,This was a great I was staying at Orlando for a week and this was one of the places I wanted to go The pizza was really Mac tonight was also there which was mind My only complain was the pizza was pretty but other then I would recommend this for people staying at Orlando
26517,4,I guess I checked something off my bucket list I even know I The biggest How Pasta on dishware at Yes The place was a but worth it for the It was our first night visiting Orlando so we let our kiddo run around the H U G E play I kinda But the amount of children in it and not knowing how often it was cleaned had me a little Definitely worth the even for just a And KUDOS to all this place is AND a Bless

26364,4,We ate breakfast here every morning while staying at a hotel around the The food was always made correct and however the large amount of homeless people hanging out make things a little more condiments are self the security guard has to let you into the sometimes hard to find a
26362,4,They accidentally gave my friends and I a whole order that we and they also gave us the actual orders we All in all they were pretty fast They have to be because that place is always packed because of the Santa Monica I understand that not always going to be clean there not much room to clean there most of the If I could give I
26360,4,They always have a lot of staff in specially on the week ends and at peak You will always see a lot of tourist due to the perfect location near the shopping and the This also means that there will be homeless there as I like to live and let live so I mind sharing space with my fellow With that said there is security at hand at all Even when this place looks crowded the service is fast and like most with a You get something to eat at a great price in a perfect

22303,4,The biggest seller to me is that it is open 24 hours a It helps to have somewhere to go eat when your biological clock is ahead of the local time and you wake up The food was The drink was Service was During my there were two vagrants got into an argument by the main One parked his belongings and while the second one exited and began to rifle thru A few cuss words and flung arms in gesturing and the situation calmed The staff observed for an outcome prior to so I am going to assume that this has occurred before and they got the handle on
31467,4,Good place to eat at if on the I like the sausage biscuit
31468,4,Fresh been around staff seems to have become better under new management but over good place to
24449,4,No heavy traffic which means your food is made fresh and rarely sitting for too Would recommend over entertainment location further up international drive where the prices are significantly

21630,4,Bad service but consistent quality in food
31474,4,Very good customer service near the Dallas zoo very pretty theme of animals
28003,4,This is one of the busiest I have ever Very modern Most people were getting food to go so there was plenty of room to sit but so many people waiting for At least it was very
27996,4,It can get tight getting inside when a delivery truck next to the Most especially when going towards the
31435,4,A Mickey outside of the And then to have it zoo themed other than the shake sound scaring me while I
27992,4,Excellent location with a large playground and plenty of seating for The food is your typical fare with nothing special to write They have a large parking and the bathrooms were clean during my My only recommendation would be for the managers and employees to meet up behind the restaurant or in the break room instead of right in front of one of the main doors of the It made the place look like a corner store and cheapens the image of this Their service was top notch and although they were packed during this visit the food came out fresh and without any
24435,4,I normally review but this is a good one because of the staff right You know what the food is like so no need to you either like it or you There is a very sweet older lady that works here that is She likes her is nice to customers and actually makes this place I will be Thi
22299,4,Stopped in for a quick bite to I get breakfest because they said they stop serving breakfest at And so I enjoyed a Big Mac with my morning cup of and a ice by the way its now for a cup of

27939,4,We came here twice during our visit to the The first I would have given them 5 the service was fantastic despite being extremely they gave great attention to each The second we came through the drive through and the service was It was very early in the there were only a few other cars in line 3 in front of and we were in line for at least 15
27936,4,Friendly always busy but food done in a good time and always Restaurant kept very Plenty of A good McDonalds to be
21552,4,Hit and there was a lovely member of staff with braces who was super
21550,4,cool except the waiting for the key to the bathroom
27933,4,Excellent and The inside is spacious and Friendly staff but I like the system where you have to order by yourself with the large touch makes it hard to customize your order and rather just wait in line and have the attendants take my order like most But at this you must order at the touch pad by
31506,4,line is usually long but Good spot if u want to grub on
27932,4,Pretty decent but the machines you go to for ordering was usually pretty sure the ice cream machine was broken at one point because we order any ice cream related All along it was a decent experience and I would probably go back again if ever in the area

24477,4,Totally not the fault but there was only 1 person to take orders from the double drive There were also a few minor mistakes on our order but considering they barely had staff I expected
31386,4,There is a new zoo animal added to the front can you guess what it service was gr8 and not a long
31382,4,Would be slightly better if they paid more attention when you Still pretty ok if you like the sounds of the zoo to follow you to

21691,4,Good hot food and
28051,4,Food was fine but line at drive thru was slow possibly because girl working window was more interested in texting then waiting on customers

31670,4,This place is they got my order wrong twice
27725,4,This is a pretty automated Probably one of the most automated ones come Many of the customers went strait to the devices shown to enter their order and just stood near the pick up counter for their I felt the process was still a bit slow given that the emphasis is for automation Plus the area to stand was congested since
30607,4,a whattaya Has digital ordering kiosks that actually work so there is In a neighborhood full of tourist some reliability is a
27722,4,Convenient to the east end of Kalakaua Long line in the morning for Staff friendly and they deliver to your is the only reason I gave it 4 homeless person racked out at one of the
27719,4,You know what gonna Lobby was closed at the hour we went but there were seating options out by the beach so that was Its nice to have somewhere cheap and quick to eat late at night because everything else that was open was and much
31674,4,So sad that its I would bring my grandkids here from time to time
27716,4,Limited menu especially the breakfast Food came out pretty fast though and was
21447,4,Had a egg mcmuffin and coffee it was good

22387,4,They have outside seating of the and tourists and beggars right outside But We wait too long to order food and it was packed with tourist which is cool because in They also have a to order food if you want to wait in Alot of seatings in McDees for groups or No public bathroom beach nearby though with lots of restrooms at

23718,4,Lines were long even at 7pm but food was hot at this location and they skim on the ice cream cones
27715,4,Breakfast specials are The sausage burrito and sausage McMuffins with eggs are freshly Been wanting to try their spam eggs and rice but during our visit their rice cooker working so t

27762,4,Clean place with and accurate The chicken nuggets were delicious and We ordered through the Drive Thru with hardly any wait The attendant confirmed our order no less than and I was given exactly what we The inside is clean well as the and has a lot of also an indoor play area for the In this location you place your order on the touch screens in front of the
21451,4,is good place to eat but they might get some orders wrong but still ok cause they have this thing where they are making food from all different McDonalds in different countries
22386,4,This seemed to be but worked hard to get it We were told by an employee that eventually that would be self order on those and all employees would work in No counter How sad and so We want people to talk to not
27760,4,Typical McDonalds but extremely long waits due to proximity to tourist Be prepared to wait mins in the drive even for a mobile order
24552,4,I like self order machines

27399,4,This location has a fun indoor playroom The play equipment always seems to be clean and I take my granddaughter there and she always has The only reason for the four out of five stars is because their projection play mat has not worked properly since we have been visiting there over the last It has partially worked on a couple of occasions and my granddaughter remembers that she enjoyed Every time there she stomps on it to try to make it She will grab my hand and pull me over to the mat and try and get me to make it I

23636,4,Went through the drive nothing to complain But you can tell that the people who work there do not want to be Too many fast food places in this area are like that Maybe if they got paid a livable wage be Maybe they deserve to be treated like human beings Yeah I think

21261,4,All around the inside is but need to check air vents its All Soda Machine need to be constantly watched because when its busy it gets nasty and dirty floor looks clean but need more and the windows all around need to be and of course the Very Impressive One As far as the overall Managers and Staff need to be reminded and or trained that a Franchise who really depends on Customers to have more happy people to come to visit and eat Customer Service is Very Your Cashier Staff or Front Staff is not following their And why is it I walk in and I was stared by your staff and like they like to be friendly and all showing how great and wonderful to have a job lets you interact with people is one of the most questioned part of Are a People Are good or happy to be around The Outside Area is good Actually better than Food is very good but prepared Sloppy on my tray and the way it was wrap and coffee I have to dump some because they fill it to the I mean they can save a lot of coffee expense and time making sure ask the customer if they want it fill to the top or you have good location ok dining area staff not not customer service oriented plus the Manager is he or she really watching the staff and or helping to correct any discrepancies or This is THE MC DONALD WHO GENERATE a lot of the revenue because of its best quality fast food deals and environment GREAT CUSTOMER

13809,4,biggest in the world but still a the golden arches really do anything impressive i disappointment is kinda Walked in with no I like that they have other food besides the regular was impressed by the brick oven pizzas they were putting we tried ordering breakfast but they were out of so many like not sure how you run the biggest and not have stuff on hand at in the It super Love the kiosk what you get for demanding for fast food Love even more that you can order from your app and just go pick it up at the Our fries were as expected from the golden the top floor has seating and an the main floor has a lot of seating areas with plenty of window for it being the it really seem THAT big they could have more of a variety of entrees foods dishes that is different from a regular neighborhood just a
13801,4,So many unusual Got the pepperoni and mushroom pizza and the ham and cheese french Really enjoyed the experience and would highly recommend everything stop The chocolate cake was pretty good
4319,4,Good ice vanilla sugar free coffee
13789,4,a huge and has a nice choice of other foods that are Not your basic
4375,4,Nice food is quick price is
13752,4,Did you know McD in Orlando has a Philly they really a big mac minus the sauce on a hoggie But good job trying new
4367,4,I eat here but clean and machines that you can at
13760,4,Very average experience Was cool because of the whole but it was extremely hectic inside with kids running and screaming Took a while to even get the opportunity to then food took a while to get to which is understandable since it was so Ice was out in soda Not a very clean place Pizza was Very flavorless pretty soggy and could have used more time in the the oven could be If they put like more effort into the flavor of the pizza it would be a lot Onion were also just onion Not a big just a little But what else you expect from a Food is a little pricier than the used to as Would probably have a better experience making the effort to dine
4366,4,Good can use the kiosk to order with credit cards
4365,4,Not much I can a Customer service was
13766,4,Biggest in the has special menu items and pastas sleep on the ravioli Being the it was a madhouse some kiosks down some just the payment part not food was inside was a but you can only get the special items
4261,4,It was my first time visiting this location it was It was staff was I would visit again if in the
13773,4,Was told that we had to come here because it is the biggest in the It is there is an elevator that takes you up to a kids playplace and full size They also off menu items that on a menu like build your own pasta and pizza
4340,4,Decent enough Service fries hot and no trouble finding a
13778,4,Because it is the largest it is a place where you go there so you can scratch off your bucket It is very very a lot of of They have and sweets beside the regular I think the staff works hard and as fast as they In my the management has to step in big time in order for this place to run The self order machines two or three so it added to the slow Upstairs is an arcade game You need It is very stuffy and even more noisy as I a place to visit in a love so you know you did
4326,4,It was sent a mobile order in and it was ready before I got there
4325,4,They prepped 130 nuggets for me in 10 of god or act of Excellent
13785,4,This has a amazing inside playground and arcade Beautiful fish tanks for the kids to look at while you are It does get a little loud when the kids Plenty of tables for Order downstairs and take a number they bring it to Super nice when you have difficulty walking g like I However drinks are Handicapped parking in front of the An elevator to the second floor and handicap tables with half booths My neices love this
4324,4,Ha I ordered a small fries got a large loved it lol
13788,4,Kids had a great Hard to find play areas these Great selection of arcade Our cheeseburgers were cold however i saw more customers opt for the pizza and philly
4352,4,what more can I Other than it gets really busy though checkout too Lots of shopping
4376,4,Not usually crowded which I The staff could smile more
4258,4,Better service than manager moved my order He wanted my order number to ease the
13856,4,is from a Fire oven turned out Cheesesteak was also very good upstairs was was pretty hot when we went sweatted up a storm from playing at the play place which was also warm did not have any issues finding have tables for big groups on the 2nd level of
4189,4,Very friendly looks clean service is great
13903,4,Yo first time This joint got a play talking arcade style on the second
4187,4,They had a very limited but to make an agile they have two big touch screen menus to place your order faster than going to directly to the cashier They only have one unisex so if you are in a be prepared mentally to Anyway I think enjoy your if you take in consideration these
4183,4,food is food notting to I like the But the location is very cool and the music gives you a good Again I just like the
4179,4,The Big Mac fresh but service was I would like to suggest everyone to download their They offer great deals rewards points to receive free food
13915,4,This location is huge for a It has play area and arcade It also offers customize pizza and pasta in addition to the usual Prices are slightly more compared to other which is justifiable given the amenities it I saw some reviews complained about slow or bad I notice that on my I think it worths a visit if u happen to be in the
4163,4,The place seems very understaffed for the amount of traffic comes through this store so the registers are usually empty so order at the The food might take a bit also but
13918,4,Food is okay just like another but they have service is okay but always building is amazing for kids with the playground and
4151,4,Pretty busy and kind of dingy in lighting Service is not as fast as you might however the food is quite
13921,4,surprisingly fast for such a large busy After time at Disney it is nice to have a more affordable
4145,4,a good place to go and get a quick snack and drink
4144,4,Standard run of the mill We only had a coffee and a hot But no problems
13924,4,It was good but very They have extended menu from regular Macdonald which I recommend to
13926,4,This places was crazy Took 45 minutes to get our The play area was a fun
13927,4,biggest it is really cool you should see this when in Orlando 2 stories tall ginormous playground and arcade and they have special menu items I got the brick oven pizza that was cooked in an actual Brick Oven it was actually pretty good and cheap but the service is very slow it took them 30 minutes just to give me my
13894,4,Neat experience but dirty We did come around 11pm and they were very Husband did love the
13893,4,A really fun So many food It was easy to find The quality of food was about cafeteria quality but it still beat having to eat something considered regular food at this They have a large indoor play an fish a sundae The kids loved
4203,4,NEW NEW great The homeless shelter vibe is the place is the service is Thanks for adding the security guard and the great new Well that last The new manager apparently still better than it was before
4216,4,Absolutely You can order fast and when I went I was sure that It would take lot of time but that the food was cooked in just a few and it
4241,4,not a bad by any stretch of the but there are better in fairly plenty of the food was made There are none of those fancy new ordering and the bathrooms are
13860,4,I lived in all my life and this location is the biggest I have been It has an upstairs downstairs for Upstairs also has a game I order anything because the prices seem higher than That was understandable because located in a tourist I just amazed of how it look Seems like a great place 2 sit eat with the
4240,4,Great and extremely quickly Very kind and professional Will most certainly visit And the food in is always An American
13868,4,This a large The entire upstairs is an and It comes with the problems you might expect in the largest the largest The upstairs bathroom was real I have been and you The Big Breakfast with Hotcakes was
13871,4,Great Never though i would eat a stake and egg breakfast in It was a bit overcrowded for my Other than Food was food was cooked to Would go back
4233,4,Best for quick
4228,4,This is a which is The receipt printer was broken for a while which was annoying because they would still read off the order numbers as a method of calling the layout is a bit It narrows significantly in the middle of the making it hard to get through to the doors and the counter at busier
13855,4,I went here with a lot of expectations so a little its pretty great place This place is like a mini Chucky cheese married a and its give birth to this biggest Its 2 floors with limited They do have wood fired I wish I tried The pizza looked The staffs were super One employee went around asking how everyone was
4224,4,Very quick surprisingly easy to operate their self service Order was ready really I usually go to McDonalds but I was in a tight time For a restaurant it was not very I would definitely go back to this location if I needed to go to McDonalds in New York Highly recommend stopping in to this location if you are in the
13876,4,it is the biggest on It is a 2 story building that offers specialty and custom built it has a huge indoor playground for kids as well as the arcade The We tried pizza it was pretty good having in mind it came from the fast food Touch screen menu had enough options of ingredients to customize pizza order based on personal Keep in mind that some toppings cost I would rate pizza points out of The This is clearly a family place which is the service was pretty quick given the
4221,4,You can sit and eat The quality of the food is always on point during Breakfast and lunch I have yet to visit during dinner
13879,4,This is the first I have went to that creates pasta and Believe it or it taste super surprised my dish come out everything come with a It is a bit expensive than every other since one plate of customize pasta or coal customized pizza can cost from depending on what you It is easily for 3 people to spend at least at this I recommend their philly
4217,4,Pretty cool
13888,4,very busy with a larger Food was a bit and it was hard to find a Pizza was surprisingly
13889,4,This is the largest by square They have play and unique menu items like Belgian a bistro and dessert options you find at any other fear because they still have the chicken and
13891,4,So it is my birthday today and I wanted to try something I have never tried in my 47 A pizza or as they call it a McPizza are only 3 that serve The Pizza and pasta were truly We did the ordering from the kiosk and proceeded to our Everything was great except they bring my So I asked the gentleman that brought the food to bring the We were nearly done by the time we received it and it was After eating we went to get the correct one and the manager had an attitude and basically filled a small cup up with milk and handed it to Overall the food was The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because of the issue with the We will be back but next time we will get
13875,4,Be prepared to spend per Clean bathrooms Staff is friendly and helpful with the Upstairs is wild and
4122,4,They got fast hands to make a sandwich from 5 Seconds no wait in this day over crying good food hamburgers taste like
13749,4,Being local we try to stay away from the busy tourist places but this is so big we really We like the fact they bring your food to your table and the employees try their best to keep this place The customers tend to be rude and push people or not say excuse me in this
4379,4,Always a pleasant place to stop for lunch and take a
4564,4,fast
13642,4,Really cool McDonalds with different menu items then Had a cheese blue Fanta slushie and a mcrib Pizza was actually pretty Store is big but hectic and not the Service was super easy self checkout and brought to your Young fella delivering table orders was hilarious and a great
4559,4,Clean and fast
13646,4,tourist Yeah but worth McPizza was like a really good gas alley The alfredo over salty but no worse than frozen stoffers or big box store The Pesto basil was actally not not Bronx NY italian by any means but Playplace for the the video games are not same money drain as any
4555,4,it and the McNuggets
4552,4,why are you reading
4543,4,Just like any in the
13652,4,Was greeted with a welcoming fish tank as decor and friendly atmosphere from the although it seems like most things in the menu were sold Food quality unfortunately did the food does look visually appetizing but lacks in taste and Would recommend stopping by if you want to experience something
4537,4,Accurate and usually Friendly
13656,4,paying for what This is a crowded Keep that in lines are and the food is the same as any other except for the specials and People are trying their so expect a restaurant If you have time and a limited this will fulfill your Always check for they always have

4574,4,Open
13632,4,Since known as I had to take the opportunity of visiting the largest even though it meant and extra hour and fifteen minute drive each this place is and legendary among fast food junkies like myself for the fact that they serve pizza and I would have been more impressed if they had the McRib but it was not to even at the largest This was an incredibly busy even at There are tons of local hotels and tourists were with most of them speaking a language besides The restaurant the but that had to be due to the fact that they are open and always To my the bathrooms were very clean and what is unique at this Hand dipped hard ice cream Multiple with an arcade and playland upstairs A pizza and pasta section A big fish tank in the lobby It was difficult to get into the parking lot due to construction and but there was plenty of The one side of the building has a giant neon Ronald McDonald which was I wanted to try the pizza or but unfortunately I had eaten a nice dinner about an hour earlier and only had room for a which I ordered through the It was pretty hectic with tons of kiosks for which was helpful since they had different language selections to match the language of those Some of my family got hand scooped ice but it was a as nobody was working that and we had to wait ten minutes after waiting in the busy line at the counter to ask for somebody to help they eventually got their hard ice cream and it was It was definitely neat to see this but it was a bit too busy for and the workers said that this was light traffic as compared to how busy it gets during the
13621,4,Arcade and play place on second floor was This offers and philly cheese just to name a Ordered from the regular menu however and fries were Warm but There was a employee walking by asking if everything was ok which lead me to realize I get juice for my happy meals which they
13748,4,A fun place to go to maybe once or Went during the The ordering kiosk lines were slow because people know how to use ordering was out of pasta but they had I was bummed because I wanted to try the I ended up ordering a regular meal you can get at any Seating was easy to find and the tables were Employees were The arcade upstairs seemed pretty cool and definitely We play any games or play in the play I enjoyed seeing Mac Tonight playing the Next time get some
13664,4,Biggest in the Has an arcade and huge play place You can buy etc The kids loved The staff was Our order was Even has an If hungry and want to see it its worth

4409,4,Good for late night bites near the train while around the NYU
13714,4,This has a pizza and pasta area made to order and is very good but like any hard to find the staff that are willing to work in such a busy and crazy You cannot order with a real person You have to order from a kiosk and they always get your order right or forget There is a drive through that is kind of like a race track and wraps around the building with 2 or 3 lanes and if your order is oh so be Just take it or leave There is a huge play place for kids and a second floor with an
4400,4,The service was good the bathrooms are very dirty
4398,4,One of the nicer Friendly staff and clean place to eat
13724,4,Came on a Sunday afternoon on March break and I hated every minute of the experience My family however had a pretty good so I bother to explain to them the downsides of mas
4395,4,Your average Short ok fast You get what you expect from
13734,4,Very big i had to order from a kiosk but used to it and fine with I ordered three things came out to about very decent i ate inside and in about 5 minutes a worker came to my table with my The customer service was very nice and they have a play place for the they also serve pastas and cake here so it surprised me but overall great experience I will say because of the play place there is naturally a lot of parents bringing their kids so it can be very
13736,4,Largest Mcdonald at the word they very beside regular manu they have pizza and steak on also big arcade on the secound went for place was really thats the reason i didnt take pictures from the
4387,4,Convenient with the kiosk to customize my order and pay

4441,4,Had gone at staff could be better
4478,4,Good quick service
4626,4,Good for a
4119,4,Probably the cleanest McDonald in the partly due to the posted security at the front door to prevent transient homelessness to take Also the competent day and night managers who motivated the food preparation team to perform This place should be the exemplary MacDonald store that all the other macDonald stores in the city should learn
13932,4,The kids had a Very hectic and tons of folks are You order at a kiosk and then they bring your food to Our food arrived in an orderly the fries were cold and we had to send them The kids enjoyed the play area and game I recommend you let your kids wear socks or bring Otherwise they run around the nasty floor barefooted when they are on the They also have an icecream and dessert

12992,4,
4902,4,Good
13079,4,They always have a lot of staff in specially on the week ends and at peak You will always see a lot of tourist due to the perfect location near the shopping and the This also means that there will be homeless there as I like to live and let live so I mind sharing space with my fellow With that said there is security at hand at all Even when this place looks crowded the service is fast and like most with a You get something to eat at a great price in a perfect
13082,4,They accidentally gave my friends and I a whole order that we and they also gave us the actual orders we All in all they were pretty fast They have to be because that place is always packed because of the Santa Monica I understand that not always going to be clean there not much room to clean there most of the If I could give I
13083,4,We ate breakfast here every morning while staying at a hotel around the The food was always made correct and however the large amount of homeless people hanging out make things a little more condiments are self the security guard has to let you into the sometimes hard to find a
13084,4,I just had a large fry it was okay the kids had hamburger happy the burgers were cold and they ate the and of course really liked the toy 7 out of 10 today
13088,4,It was Unfortunately they do refills
13093,4,The service is fast but since the pandemic it seems that the mask is the most important security is polite and the Cusomer service associates are kinda formal but still can eat on the patio but not for
13094,4,cheap sustenance to keep on We had a couple burgers and fries and I complain they were alright when the price is taken into It can be quite busy at times so keep this in mind when going at peak The restaurant itself was pretty what you come to expect from a

13070,4,No different than any other except that in Santa Monica very close to the pier and surprisingly well kept and clean and very Lots of tourists and visitors and the location is updated with the order kiosk systems so can get moving pretty Seating can be an issue on very crowded Over all good experience and not too
13066,4,Convenient location and although there are some challenges the area faces and everything that goes with the restaurant does a good job keeping things service and food good as We had an order with a lot of custom requests for kids extra and each burger was put together exactly as
13063,4,Good McD centrally located and quick

13000,4,It has been a mighty long time since I need ed to concern myself with dining in at Since the option to dine in was
13007,4,not clean and there are no offers but still Bathroom is usually clean
13008,4,Lots of homeless people inside
4896,4,Good
12993,4,Look the staff here is great despite the unwanted obvious Food is prepped fast and staff are Restroom are actually kept clean again despite certain unfortunate I always take out from here and go to the Or park my car at the very top of the lot and eat
4889,4,Well
13020,4,This McDonalds is conveniently close to Santa Monica Pier 1 block I love buying food from here and eating it by the shoreline with friends Do that workers can sometimes be very stingy or serious due to the large amount of people that come in daily McDonalds in particular gets very So please be kind to they are trying their best to get your food
4887,4,Good
13030,4,a Nice due to location you can grab a small amount of food and go to the also people talk about beggers being near it but I see any all I saw was a man overdosing on drugs
13044,4,The only reason I am giving this location for stars instead of 5 is because I eat or fast the one day that I did go to Santa I just had a sudden craving for something fatty and I went inside and dislocation surprisingly very The staff there were also very and I ordered me some french fries and a sweet iced and then I proceeded to the outdoor Courtyard to Out there was just as clean as it was on the I had since so I was really surprised at how fresh the french fries and the sweet iced tea taste Everything was okay okay with
13046,4,Always has an abundance of homeless population hanging out inside and that you get 5 Felt dirty although they were constantly cleaning the Food is your typical no change They offer a bathroom but its a busy Overall return with caution
13055,4,There have been issues with some of the patrons getting out of hand with the but it seems that the issue has My family generally order through food delivery apps from this location to avoid unruly They always get our order and the delivery is
13058,4,Very very Saw a guy come in who homeless and 2 security guards immediately swarmed in and ushered him It was kind of yet I felt so sorry for the guy and thought security should have been more sensitive when doing the job because the man clearly all the rest room was very however prefer paper towels on hand in addition the the I had to touch the press down facet button and I had to touch the soup I like to use paper towels to touch these especially the door when
13016,4,To be I usually frequent this local Santa Monica Micky for its I have to wake up pretty so a nice jolt of caffeine helps me start the day at With that being I will also say that because of Santa influx of homelessness over the this particular location gets alot of homeless Most are and I buy some of the regulars a thing or two from time to the aggressive homeless patrons that make the place feel The staff tries to placate but you can tell they are getting frustrated more and more if you be and react positively to people who are just trying to get through the the go I need you screaming and being annoyed at every little
13120,4,They were friendly but they never gave me a tray because they never asked here or to The service was I had my food ready before I could fill up my

4670,4,It was ok
13579,4,World largest Food is the they have pizza and pasta The seating and ordering process was quick and but actually getting the food on time together was a Our burgers came in fairly fast 10 minutes or but pizza took 30 from the time when we ordered I had to come down and ask for my order for them to give me the this worth a single especially the playground if you have If you looking for a quick I would go to the other locations with less people and quicker
13582,4,This place is Large play place and fun Pizza at we tried Overall it was delicious and had great although the crust was a little thin for my Overall fairly floors were a little Bathrooms were
4634,4,it

13591,4,Very cool got food on menu you will not see at any other The pasta was cool but not the Service was really Had a good
13592,4,Overall a good experience at this the largest in if not the country a very big I actually did not go upstairs to the arcade just ate and But additional options pizza and I had both and both equally good A little longer wait for those so expect the additional cook
4631,4,It was ok
13594,4,I guess I checked something off my bucket list I even know I The biggest How Pasta on dishware at Yes The place was a but worth it for the It was our first night visiting Orlando so we let our kiddo run around the H U G E play I kinda But the amount of children in it and not knowing how often it was cleaned had me a little Definitely worth the even for just a And KUDOS to all this place is AND a Bless
13595,4,This was a great I was staying at Orlando for a week and this was one of the places I wanted to go The pizza was really Mac tonight was also there which was mind My only complain was the pizza was pretty but other then I would recommend this for people staying at Orlando

13598,4,Not entirely sure what I expected when going to the worlds largest I mean just a fast food place The place is huge brick ovens for thin and crispy hand crafted pasta and speciality meal the everyday kitchen then followed by a staircase to an playhouse and more sit down The pizza was only after It was a small personal pie thin and crispy b

14826,4,Most have no idea the historic significance of this Back in the ALL McDonalds restaurants were no indoor You ate in your car standing Oak Park had an ordinance that stated but Ray Kroc of McDonalds wanted a McDonalds in his home So in order to get approval to be THIS very agreed to install stand up tables inside so technically you could eat It was to my knowledge the first McDonalds ever where you could sit inside and As I it opened 1966 or It was a VERY big deal around the
3614,4,Definitely better than what we are used to in Italy

14837,4,One of the best McDonalds near Fresh

14725,4,Long lines but for when they are selling crack I mean two all beef patties with special sauce on a sesame seed The problems lies when you have a big order at the drive You must hold the line to make sure you got everything you ordered because you dont want to have to go inside or go through the drive through Quite a

7153,4,This place has that usual Which
7149,4,Fish sandwich was cold and French vanilla latte tasted horrible when I went at about 1am
7168,4,Awhile back I made a bad review but since then major improvements to the restaurant and the service have been Solid McDonalds
7474,4,what the can you add
8757,4,I would love the exact location i dined This one employee only seemed to be against having me eat The woman cashier literally want to order with the 2 for one menu sandwich deal i just recieved on on my She offer me a pen to write my code on the so i used a penny to write the so she tells me but i wrote the exact code and it looked as though i wrote in She immediately try calling so i asked the other employees for a The manager was very and even after helped with all and left to the the woman tells me how this is my last order and i have 14 minutes left to It was ammusing so i played the idiot customer I definitely appreciate the understanding for i was also a little short on exact so you can already guess how the woman treated me about On the plus side I enjoyed my meal
8724,4,The line was pretty but they moved us along fairly Food was warm and my order was Not much else to say about a fast food joint
7414,4,Nice
8445,4,The food is but the portions are very small for the The attention is the place clean and the bathroom clean and I love
8447,4,On several occasions I have I bought and then I did not get what I asked for or requested and I have to exchange it for something They should be more aware of their inventory
7413,4,Well corporate owned
8450,4,It is a place to take the children to have them They often get the orders But overall not that bad
7412,4,Cheap Make sure you get a straw
8455,4,The mask against the virus did not let me speak English well with the girl from the driver though up
7409,4,Good Good
7403,4,Decent area and good
8473,4,The prices are better in Utah than Idaho or the app has great If you do the survey on the recite than you get a buy one get one free Since I have frequented for a long I must admit that I have mixed sentiments regarding the On the one the meal is typically pretty and I like the quick and convenient there are some problems that come to realize over time that make me feel like the experience as positive as it once The rising costs of the products on the menu are one of my main Every time I visit it seems like the costs have increased once This makes it challenging to continue frequenting them as much as I once especially with the availability of more economical fast food Another problem is that used to give frequent and significant discounts and but lately they seem to be less frequent and This is disappointing because always valued the ability to occasionally save a few dollars on my Having said there are still a few aspects of that I genuinely The majority of the cuisine is delicious and and the quickness of service is still The restaurant is always spotless and making it a perfect choice if you need a fast dinner on the I would say that is still a good option for fast but because of the rising costs and less it has lost its place as my top a typical burger and fries are a great choice if searching for a quick and delectable
7400,4,For a lunch on the go not too shabby of a place
7399,4,Not too bad for
7398,4,Under No drive
8488,4,It was very cheap compared to what used to in can easily buy two full combo likely even Food is decent as

7314,4,Clean and not too busy Maybe the competition is keeping them in check
8640,4,The cheeseburgers and chicken sandwiches I order from every were noticeably better The extra onions were actually noticeable at this location but what really caught my attention was the beef It was still hot when I got and juicy too so I know it was fresher than most other The chicken patty was still hot too and I could taste the spice more than usual as This would have been a but the drive through speakers

7300,4,Your topical neighborhood Fast Food The outdoors sitting is a nice hang out
8687,4,I spend a lot of money at this location and I really ever had a bad experience the only downfall with this restaurant is it states that it is 24 hours yet it is closed during hours of the night and as I just stopped to get my breakfast this morning after it was closed again sometimes they are even closed in the middle of the day so it is not always open as stated but it has always treated me well when it comes to customer service and food quality

5392,4,The staff was the restaurant is just a little so be
11946,4,Service is even even when the place is I dare go when the place is actually a bit expected since so close to the The interior seems pretty clean and the customer service is only been on days when not so my experiences have been
11956,4,I usually go there every morning but my order usually gets messed up at least once a with that being said they do replace my meal for free on the following
11960,4,Stuff is super polite and nice and 4 stars because if you pay at a grab a receipt and a table find a proudly install the number on top of it and wait you are sort of in a your order is not shown on any you have no clue when and how you will be We waited for a good 20 min and then I just asked a very nice and polite servant if I did everything correctly and when we will be He said all is ok and they just have too many orders at this time but he said I will Suggestion to the higher All orders numbers have to be on one of the displays otherwise there are no feedback to the paid clients and with a less passionate clients you may have What is for sure is that this situation decreases efficiency of the floor workers since the current state of kiosk order processing creates a situation in which ppl will be asking questions that can easily be fixed by software

5330,4,This has probably been remodeled two or three The interior is Like REALLY If here hunting happy meal they charge you for the some places will charge only You can use the app but beware the tricky mobile app order and Mobile is a pain to not always able to know where your order and it takes way longer to order on your phone or at a kiosk than it does in get too bad because tons of food options

11260,4,The drivethru line at this location had and will always be Dont ask me because i do not Maybe it is because the 3rd window is rarely but go inside if you have a small order as its faster to go to a Check your order when they are super busy as they give you a or another order on Otherwise my favorite place to get a large for
5667,4,Good
6082,4,This location always has a crowd so I gave 4 however they are extremely fast in So if running late into the office this is the place to
6080,4,a you get what you expect from here every As a place for very and consistent food
10234,4,They was nice but no more food on the menu I was not very happy about this with me living on a goverment check so I have to much money when I was told that they stoped the dollar menu so with me not having to much money I got some thing to eat no I go back to no because of no more dollar menu I will be going to like Burger King they have a dollar menu or Jack In The Box the meal are a lot cheaper than I think they lost their minds not having the dollar menu no more other than that they was very nice because in a power wheelchair
10235,4,never actually gone inside this location but I use the drive thru fairly a pretty busy spot but even before they put in the ordering system the service was always
10242,4,Had the sausage cheese along with my girlfriend for a quick breakfast before heading home from to San it hit the spot since i was in a
10243,4,They order for you on the touch screen if theyre The only I tried where their hash brown didnt come out hot and Very disappointed and will not order breakfast at this
10247,4,They cool no handle picking up from they
10249,4,Stopped for a quick meal in between bus They provided quick service and thankfully no errors on the food Appreciated that the diner was relatively
6073,4,Food was fast fresh and Place was clean with rapid service
10250,4,I tried curbside delivery using the app and it The only problem is that there are only 2 delivery spots and regular customers park in That defeats the Inside the place was clean and there are 2 ordering
10253,4,Great The only reason it is 4 and not 5 ia because of the homeless people who are never If you give them a dollar they ask for another If no money is available then they ask for If no cigs are available they ask for food Im getting tired of
6072,4,Just happy to find a place to get something quick to
6070,4,on a messy knockoff block
6066,4,Fast service and ok food but no where to sit due to bums laying in the booths Maybe get some employees to check up there
6061,4,One of the cashiers were nice because there was no line ordering food was like
6083,4,For a mcdonalds in an extremely busy I think the staff were doing a great job keeping everything The area was clean enough I am particular about the kiosks were in working order besides one but it hold up the orders at Food deals were clearly the ordering system correct as you usually grab a tent and go to a table but one of the staff saw us wondering about it and told us to just put a number so they were clearly attentive to what was going on around Food came out Same cost for food as any other mcdonalds cheap food for a late
10224,4,Fast customer Manager is They treat homeless with equal Thumbs up for Fries were not as good as I Thats why I give 4
10214,4,Everything went quickly done was
6093,4,Dirty but there are empty seats to eat The atmosphere is not bad for Their app have good deals
10139,4,The food was it was surprisingly very
10140,4,Usually are pretty Except my last I had ordered a box of They messed up and gave me a bag which had 3 cookies in I emailed them and they still
6117,4,Why a
10148,4,Good customer fast service and very
10150,4,The difference in taste of the meat from the Big Mac to the quarter pounder was Like it even come from the same type of So will not be doing the Big Mac They were fast and they were but still
10168,4,not your typical over price on their menu plus they do not accept coupon or does any special like regular I think they feel the need to make their money from the Disneyland patron and ridiculous toward the regular but all boil down to make Sometimes they can be rude toward the black customer but what to expect from seeing who goes into this Most of the customer that goes into this store are traveller which is mostly Caucasian
10176,4,If you are visiting this particular notice that you are very nearly in the middle of the strange land encompassing skid row and the new upwardly trendy lofts and shops that seek to define Download Los This manages to straddle this uncomfortable melange quite The inside of the restaurant was bright and The counters looked new and the menu sign actually was orderly laid out with sensible photos next to the main I eat fast food often and the overhead menus always confuse me with this and I know that I am not getting the best price But this menu seemed far we ordered and our food was served quickly my special request done just We ate in and the table was clean as was the true we were approached twice by people asking for but they were not intrusive and I had the feeling the manager and staff were well aware of who was in the restaurant and I feel uncomfortable at The staff was so attentive that for the first time I actually filled out the online survey just to compliment quite a compliment in itself coming from
10285,4,Holy The lattes here are super Spanish latte creamy but not milky latte with a hint of cinnamon that Lavender matcha latte strong matcha flavor that compliments the not milky at I really like floral matcha
10177,4,a nice I have not dined But even when the line looks long during the morning I can honestly say that they provide a faster service to get you out
6107,4,This location has a young crowd on the They play good music while you drink frappe and have a big
6105,4,clean and The only a lot of I was sitting near some rather rude people but I really blame the restaurant for Just a
6099,4,Nice place bery busy but the crew handle also the food is on point few mcs have i could eat again there
6097,4,Cheap and fast Tasty
10202,4,Car ordering not so Walk in was and especially clean all
10203,4,Ver small dinning most orders to many people who are traveling by greyhound go for last meal before leaving
10206,4,It was great other than the soda options the best not much to choose from should definitely have root beer as an I think they should get the new touch screen soda dispenser there that had plenty of soda options to choose from would be very
10184,4,The food at this location is usually hot and Services usually Today however my breakfast sandwich had a lot of egg shells in That usually but you still have to be careful nonetheless
6123,4,Just went to get mcnuggets for my it was too early for them to make It was only They were still making So I went to Wendy at the S I ferry where they make the chicken mcnuggets any

10391,4,Took a little longer to prepare a simple Late the actitud was good
6004,4,Manager saw me waiting a little longer than usual and went back to the kitchen to see what was wrong and got back with my Very

6165,4,This McDonalds is located right next to Madison Square garden making it an easy stop right before or after the They are also very clean and the staff seemed to be The food came fast compared to other fast food places in the city The touchscreens that you order your food on had a tough time scanning the vaccine card and the place was small inside compared to other fast food Great place near the garden but my when I hit that area of the city
10068,4,A cool little get away spot in the city when you need that FREE WIFI and also I love The staff are not too but they are in the center of traffic with people shopping and across the street from Madison Square I still like the Check it Live Life Unscripted

6129,4,I wanted 2 barbecue sauce packets and they forgot to give me
10020,4,Good
6174,4,It is great thant you can actually eat inside the place no like many other restaurants in the area at the moment because of the omicron The bad thing that the personal in these particular is going to have to wait for your food at least 5 to 10 It is the price you have to pay if you want to eat inside haha

6204,4,a decent The issue is its a high tourist area and hub for New Yorkers to do a lot of shopping or transferring That also comes with people who are on homeless and so But not that bad

10907,5,Despite it being rush hour in Miami the place seem dirty nor the The is no parking near the McDonalds so have to find a way to park Customer Interaction was which was because this McDonalds had a purchasing mechanism for people to buy whatever they want there and receive a receipt to show the cashier and basically all left is waiting for your Quick You are able to pay with cash if you but the money will go to the not the The mechanism does accept any kind of
25677,5,Hard to
10899,5,Food Prepared quick and Everything was sooo Burger fries fresh and me of food from the

10827,5,Good drive through And the fish filet sandwich was cooked I would ask people leaving the drive through to NOT come back out onto the 16th street because it causes havoc at that Please follow the signs around to the not that far out of you have to be rude and prevent people from turning right on
10817,5,I am a big admirer of Bear Freaks doing man vs wild in Discovery From his program I have learnt about Maybe I would think I would never visit this But it just happened without giving a thought to obviously I loved I believe nobody would disagree who visited this place
10811,5,Well the Chicken Burger Beef Burgers Fries were the best The Milkshakes are the most delicious ones ever had with all that cream on the top
10806,5,I like the braveness curiosity of Mac to try the automated standing I do not care if the idea worked or but he took the That is what business is all Okay nice location next to the touristic places of Lincoln Rd Washington I gave it 5 stars because they deserve it if u compare this location to others to other fast food Super clean regardless of the homeless community in

13577,5,The World largest is a must to visit if you have Besides the typical menu you can order pasta and customized to The dessert menu is not a large selection but pretty Only downside is the wait for the food about 30 minutes for us so the food was room temperature when we received Of the kids can and will spend hours exploring the play area and arcade few of the games were out of order and not many prizes to choose The place was packed when we Overall a good
24121,5,Great
24123,5,For the size of the building and play facilities in this the biggest and the If looking for customer service not a better off using the kiosks and have patience waiting for your recommend this place for the experience only and works with your
24124,5,This was never been to a where the service was so good and the food options were amazing
13606,5,This is the busiest Ive ever been They have the process of customer care down to a If you order to go use a kiosk because eating in could take a while because a server has to walk the food They have a pastry cafe and the play area is The employees are nice and gave great Just a heads I would avoid the drive thru between the hours of Those are the times when people are either going or coming from theme
13604,5,We are in Orlando Florida celebrating my 13th birthday so why not check out the largest The place is huge with people from all places checking it out 2nd floor is full of arcade games and a play They have a pasta and pizza section with a brick They have multiple touch screen ordering kiosks with people always in I ordered online with the app and picked it up in store or else I would have waited in The whole store is bright and clean including the One thing you like about the same flavor anywhere in the world you

24128,5,I put in an order for pickup but realize that the dining room closed at The store manager Emma and the rest of the staff were super accommodating and allowed us into the building and got us our food very Great customer
24130,5,
13600,5,This by far is one of the coolest you will ever go It apparently is one of the largest in the world and is 3 to 4 stories It has a special menu that is only designed for this specifically which makes it extremely they have made to order pastas and now I went today at in the afternoon in order to pizza and I got it within 15 but before warned if you go during a busy time it could take up to 45 and unfortunately that is the downfall dislocation is on Sand Lake Road which is in a tourism driven area off of International Drive and it is one of the busiest locations you will ever go if you go during one of these peak times it is unbelievable how busy and how disorganized the location can actually but when they are firing on all cylinders it can be a fantastic when you get the pieces or the pastas it is absolutely high and restaurant literally amazing to go into a for god and get restaurant quality food of this my pizza is Ace stone Brick Oven fired pizza and it is And it was only a little over with tax that is if ever in the area you should definitely try it
13596,5,Fantastic You must visit when in The service was The wait time for the premium menu items was It was very clean and the staff was

13660,5,Unfortunately we have the best experience We waited almost an hour for our pizzas and many of the employees seem to Apparently they lost our order and like 10 It was Everyone was going up and asking for their money The only reason giving 5 stars is because the was super kind

24328,5,Updated review This really is a great Maybe if you appreciate you been The grounds are I saw the manager picking up trash around the They wear nice uniforms and there was an employee cleaning tables as soon as they were A very nice lady on morning shift was bringing orders TO THE TABLE It was much busier at night so a longer wait but considering there are dozens of hotels I think service is pretty I went here three times during my stay in the area and the food was always place clean and staff prompt and Got a fabulous greeting Memorial Day

13811,5,Very loud and Very big inside with pizza place too Upstairs is a big kids play place But you will have to wait about 20 mins too receive your order So that a downside and its very crowded so if u have a problem with crowded places go inside because it alot of people inside ordering and waiting and just to much
13839,5,Different food options from the traditional mickey but we went for the Can easily spend a few hours here on a hot or rainy day and not break the
23865,5,Service is excellent about the food sometimes comes out cold

23900,5,No spicy Fast and the girls are young n kind
13767,5,This has to be one of the best I have ever been to hands While disappointingly I did not visit the upstairs with the arcade machines I can rave about the pasta and pizza they make and The pasta can rival olive garden and starts at and you are able to customize it how you Definitely would recommend both the pasta and even the pretty picky on pizza and the pepperoni pizza was actually pretty I usually would HATE brick oven pizza as I find they taste burnt always but this was a good Definitely worth checking out at least once if you are in the It is a little busy most times but even with that the wait is no worse than a regular
23932,5,Best in Great
13763,5,Not much to say that every other review Very fun for something Watching your pizza be put into the real brick oven at a is definitely The main reason you go is the but the food honestly The specialty menu items are a tiny bit pricey but fast food but they really are a tier above fast my fiance and I had a great time and I definitely recommend checking it

23950,5,Very quick and order was spot on
13738,5,The food was one of the biggest but quality can be improved with the fish sandwiches being burnt on the edges and burgers were not properly organized within the bun in the big just a bit of feedback compared to regular Other than that my family had a great time enjoying the upstairs atmosphere and
